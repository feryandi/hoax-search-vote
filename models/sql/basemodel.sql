Well compare prices, functionality and the performance of the three VPNs.\n\nFinally, we discuss what kind of websites are generally blocked in China.\n\nAs you probably already know, the internet doesnt work like we wish it did in China and a large number of websites are blocked by the Great Firewall. Among the websites that you cant access there are Facebook, YouTube, Twitter and Google+.\n\nThere are many other blocked websites, and depending on what you do, it will be virtually impossible for you to work in China without a VPN (Virtual Private Network) from China. The most striking case is probably given by Google.com, which often returns an error message when used from within the Middle Kingdom.\n\nIn order to solve this problem, you can install a VPN, which masks your I.P. address so that your laptop appears to be connected from the U.S. or Japan even if you are in China.\n\nA VPN will allow you to bypass the firewall and access any website you want. But you need to choose wisely: even if there are tens of VPN services available, only a few works well in China. We have tested several of them for years and today were going to review the three we like the most.\n\nWe recommend to install your VPN before you travel to China as, if you wait till you arrive in China, installing the VPN app in your smartphone will be more difficult as Google Play is blocked too!\n\nIn a nutshell, if you are looking for a VPN that has good performance, its easy to set up and has servers in many countries, we recommend you use ExpressVPN.\n\nVyprVPN has similar performances, however has less servers.\n\nThe third option is PureVPN, which offers a reliable and cheap alternative to ExpressVPN and VyprVPN.\n\nEven though there are several free options such as Freegate (which is actually a proxy, not a VPN), they arent at all reliable and are extremely slow. The practical result is that by resorting to a free option, you wont be able to do anything other than check your Facebook or Twitter feeds. Even posting a comment on Facebook will become an impossible mission. Forget about watching a YouTube video.\n\nRecently, several free VPNs have been released that might offer decent performances. Our suggestion is to consider your decision carefully before installing one of them on your laptop or smartphone as, in many cases, theyll install other applications, such as programs that cause popup ads when you are surfing the internet, programs that store your browsing data to sell it to third parties or, in the worst cases, programs that use your computer as a server (with the result that both your laptop and internet connection will work much more slowly).\n\nSince they only cost some Dollars per month, the best option is, without a doubt, to get a decent VPN service.\n\nNowadays, there is a large number of VPN services on the market. During the years weve spent in China, we tested many of them such as Witopia (which was really good back in 2010), Astrill (probably the most popular in 2011/2012), Webmaster and others.\n\nRegardless of what the reviews that you find on the web say, many of them arent working anymore because the Great Firewall is being constantly updated and its becoming more difficult to bypass it every day. Many reviews you find are outdated or written by people that never went to China; therefore, check the publication date and if the website specializes on China, before you believe to the review!\n\nSince 2013 until recently, weve been using StrongVPN and we must say that so far, we have never had many problems. However, during the last years many better VPNs appeared, when it comes down to use them from China.\n\nAs of January 2014, we started to also use VyprVPN, and rediscovered the pleasure of having internet on our cellphone. Since January 2015, due to the attack that multiple VPN providers suffered, we also began to use ExpressVPN as an alternative with features similar to those of VyprVPN. And also in this case, were very satisfied with the performances of the VPN. In October 2015 we started to use also PureVPN and so far its going well.\n\nMoney Back Guarantee: This is an important feature when choosing a VPN, most of all in China. Even though the three VPNs generally work well in China, every place is different. One VPN can work better than another in Shanghai but worse in Changsha, so it is important to have the opportunity to test the VPN before making a year commitment. With its 30 days of money back guarantee, ExpressVPN and VyprVPN offer the best guarantee.\n\nMonthly Plan: If you are traveling to China for tourism or temporarily, a VPN for only one month is the best for you. In this case, since the prices are quite similar, we recommend ExpressVPN.\n\nAnnual Plan: Annual prices for different plans may vary greatly, but if we compare the prices of plans with similar performances between the three providers (ExpressVPN, VyprVPN Premium and PureVPN), their price are 8.32, 6.67 and 5.45 USD per month, respectively. Thus, PureVPN is the cheapest.\n\nSupport: When it comes down to use a VPN in China, its extremely important to have access to a support team that can help you when your configuration, for any reason, doesnt work anymore. According to our personal experience, the experience of our writers based in China and the feedback of our readers (both the ones that let comments at the end of our articles and the ones that contact us by email), so far ExpressVPN is the company that is providing the best, fastest support.\n\nServer Count: This is a very important feature, as the more servers there are, the less likely it is that your connection will be slow or get cut out due to too many users using the same server. In this aspect, ExpressVPN is the one that offers the most guarantees.\n\nCountries With Servers: This is a basic function, especially if you want to access content restricted to a specific country. In addition, it is also necessary to obtain a good browsing speed, as the closer you are to the server, the better the potential speed will be. Therefore, having a large number of servers in countries around China increases the possibility of finding one with good services. In this aspect, in appareance PureVPN beats the competition. However, if you care more about speed, then you shall consider the fact that ExpressVPN has much more servers in countries close to China.\n\nSimultaneous Connections: Today, being able to have simultaneous connections is a basic feature of a VPN, as having a reliable and free connection to the internet is not just necessary for your laptop but also for your cell phone, tablet or other devices. Having simultaneous connections saves you from the problem of having to connect the VPN depending on which device you want to use to access the internet. With this, for example, you can check Google Maps on your cell phone while you check your Gmail on your computer. All the VPNs we recommend offer at least 3 simultaneous connections, which shall be more than enough.\n\nEncryption Protocols: Encryption protocols are important to avoid censorship and to improve security. Having various possibilities will ensure that you have more weapons to avoid the Great Firewall, as some encryption protocols dont work at times. While in China, OpenVPN tends to work the best. VyprVPN Premium also offers a protocol exclusively designed to avoid blocking, called Chamaleon.\n\nVPN Locations Switchings: This aspect is very important in China, as not all servers work well all the time, and changing servers is basic. In this aspect, there are no difference within the VPNs featured in this review.\n\nWe know this is a lot of info to digest and if you arent a tech expert, you might be a bit lost. In order to help you make the right choice, we suggest that you choose the best VPN depending on your priorities (speed, price, mobile devices performance, user-friendliness and security).\n\nStill not sure what VPN should you choose?\n\nDetermining which VPN is the fastest is quite a complicated question, as it depends on a lot of factors (encryption protocol, Chinese city from which you are connecting, the website you want to visit, and the VPN server you connect to, among many other factors).\n\nTo respond to this question, over the past months, we have been testing from within China the connection speed of the three VPNs that we recommend. To do so, we have calculated the ping, download speed and upload speed (see below for a description of these parameters) while connected to different servers of these VPNs when accessing websites located in the USA, Europe and Hong Kong. While the results obtained are complicated to interpret due to the high number of parameters involved, we have been able to come to some conclusions:\n\nWhile ExpressVPN seems to be the fastest, this may depend on the place in China from which you are connecting. If you want to verify the services of your VPN, below I give details on how to test it and interpret the results.\n\nTo calculate these values, you can go to webpages such as bandwidthplace.com, select one of the servers that is located near the websites that you normally visit (normally the United States) and calculate these values with and without the VPN activated.\n\nWith these results, you will be able to know if your VPN works well (the values will be similar to or even better than without the VPN). You will as well find out the quality of your connection in China (the values you obtain without a VPN).\n\nEncryption protocols are an essential feature when it comes to choosing a VPN, as they determine its level of security and its ability to overcome the internet blocking in China and other countries. Below you can find the main encryption protocols:\n\nRegarding China, currently, PTTP and SSTP dont tend to work, and the protocol which tends to be most effective when it comes to getting around the firewall is OpenVPN.\n\nBefore starting this section, we would like to inform you that these conclusions are not based on objective data; rather, they are based on our personal experience using VPNs in China.\n\nVPNs work better outside of large cities: Despite not being able to find technical data to confirm our observations, it appears that the Great Firewall is much more effective in large cities such as Beijing or Shanghai. This makes it a lot more difficult for VPNs to connect, and also makes connections less stable. There are even VPNs that dont work in these two cities, but which do work in second or third-tier cities.\n\nPoor internet connections limit VPN performance: While this point is obvious, we wanted to highlight it, because it seems to be typical to blame things on the quality of the VPN when it doesnt connect. Often, the problem is due to the fact that the connection quality is so bad that it prevents all VPNs from working normally. This situation is common on hotel WIFI networks (normally at hostels) or in cafs. The same goes for mobile data connections, as in large cities, they tend to be so saturated that they prevent VPNs from working properly.\n\nDifferent VPNs dont always behave the same: Its common that depending on the place youre connecting from, some VPNs work better than others. For example ExpressVPN might work better from your workplace internet connection, whereas VyprVPN might work better from home. Nonetheless, as a general rule, ExpressVPN tends to have the least problems connecting, even on low-quality connections. As for VyprVPN, even though it tends to run into quite a few problems when on low-quality networks, if you have a relatively good connection and use the connect to the fastest server option, its services are normally very good, and at times even better than those of ExpressVPN. As for PureVPN, it doesnt usually work on low-quality connections.\n\nWe recommend you choose between ExpressVPN Annual Package, Premium Annual Package and PureVPN Annual Package as, in our opinion, these are the packages that offer the best quality to price ratio.\n\nIts a common practice among VPN providers to renew your subscription automatically (included the three VPNs we recommend). This means that after one month (or one year), they will charge you for another month (or another year, according to the subscribtion you purchased).\n\nHow to avoid that?\n\nExpressVPN: ExpressVPN allows you to turn off the auto-renewal by logging in to your account.\n\nVyprVPN: To avoid the recurring payment with VyprVPN you should cancel the subscription by accessing to the Control Panel. You should do it before the actual billing period ends.\n\nPureVPN: The only way to avoid the auto-renewal with PureVPN is to sign in to your account and send a ticket asking to cancel it.\n\nNote that if you subscribe using Paypal you can also disallow recurring payments directly from your Paypal account.\n\nIn the case you forgot to deactivate the auto renewal and the company already charged you for the next billing period, in many cases you can still ask the money back. ExpressVPN gives you 30 days to ask for a refund (however its not clear if it also applies to the auto-renewal), VyprVPN doesnt specify if you can get a refund and PureVPN gives you 7 days to cancel the payment.\n\nOpen ExpressVPN software and click on Run a Speed Test. Then, click Run Tests (the blue button on the top right-hand side) and wait until the test finishes (about 5 minutes). At this point, select the server that appears first in the list (the fastest). Its as simple as that!\n\nOpen VyprVPN software and click on the Location icon. Then click on Show servers > Chronometer > Ping test. At this point you should select the server that shows the smallest number (this represents the time necessary for the info to travel from your laptop to the server).\n\nOpen PureVPN software (dont use the beta version as in our experience it doesnt work properly) and insert your user name and password. Then go to the Settings tab and, in the Security section, select VPN Mode: Best of Both Worlds Mode and activate the IPv6 leak Protection.\n\nAt this point, go back to the Dashboard, select Protocol: Automatic > Purpose Country: Optimum Anonymity/Security, then click on Quick Connect, choose a country in the map (only if needed) and, finally, click on Connect Now.\n\nIf there is any problem connecting the VPN, go back to the Dashboard and try one by one the different protocols (normally the OpenVPN should work). If it still doesnt work, go back to the Settings tab and select VPN Mode: High Security Mode.\n\nWe arent lawyers and we are certainly not qualified to provide any legal advice. So what follows is just our personal opinion:\n\nAs far as we know, using a VPN in China isnt strictly illegal. Even if its true that VPN get often blocked, in another hand VPNs are a necessary tool to improve security at companies, and because of this, it would make little sense to declare all VPN to be illegal.\n\nHowever, in January 2017 the Chinese Ministry of Industry and Information Technology declared that the VPN services in China will now need to obtain a government approval.\n\nThe new regulation seems to only refer to VPN providers that operate from within China. Its not clear yet how (and if) this will also affects VPN providers that operate from outside China (like the ones we recommend).\n\nIn any case, you should keep in mind that while using a VPN, what you are doing can be legal as well as illegal. For example, if someone uses a VPN (to avoid being identified) to scam people, its obvious that this activity is illegal and will therefore be prosecuted.\n\nOne last warning: When you use a VPN, its as if you were connecting from the country where the server is located (normally the United States). Because of that, intellectual property laws can be a lot stricter than what youre used to in China, where regulations are much more lax in this sense. Therefore, do so at your own risk.\n\nThe list of websites blocked in China is long and changes every day. Generally speaking, the most popular social networks (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Flickr, etc), blogging platforms (WordPress.com, Blogspot, etc), Google services (Google.com, Gmail, Google+, Google Hangouts Google Docs, etc) and media websites that may be or have been critical towards China (The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, Bloomberg and LeMonde, just to provide some examples) are blocked.\n\nThen, there are websites or softwares that arent blocked but are so slow that they become practically useless. The most common example is probably Skype, which works on and off (for calls, messages usually work fine).\n\nGenerally speaking, most of the websites that arent hosted in a Chinese server will be slow, when you try to connect from within China. This is especially true after 8 PM (Chinese time), as this corresponds to both American and European working times. This implies that the traffic in and out the Chinese network will be larger, and tends to saturate fairly often.\n\nThe best way to overcome this problem is, of course, to choose a VPN that is working well in China!\n\nAs weve mentioned before, evaluating which VPN is the best for China is complicated because it depends on many factors. A good VPN in one city or for a particular connection may have worse performance than in other circumstances. During times when internet restrictions are intensified (for example, party meetings, or at the beginning of Chinese New Year), some VPNs hold up better than others.\n\nThanks to our personal experience and the many comments from our readers, currently, we can say that normally ExpressVPN tends to be the one that offers the best speeds and which best holds up during times of restrictions.\n\nAs for VyprVPN, in the past, its website was blocked a few times, and some servers dont work at times (most of all, those closest to China). However, if you play with the protocols and servers a bit, normally, you can find a configuration that offers good services.\n\nAs for PureVPN, we have a lot less experience using it and while during normal times, its services are good, during times when restrictions are intensified, it seems like it has the most problems.\n\nAnother VPN that is quite popular in China, Astrill, has been a target of the Great Firewall over the past years, and because of this, it often stops working. This is one of the reasons why we no longer recommend it.\n\nWith the increasingly widespread use of VPNs in the past years, VPN service providers are constantly innovating to improve their services. One of the most recent services that all VPN service providers are incorporating are VPN routers.\n\nTo put it simply, we can say that a VPN router is like connecting your VPN directly from the router in your house or office, and not from your computer or mobile device. This has a huge advantage, as you extend the VPN over the whole network and not just from specific devices, thus improving security and permitting all devices on the network to use the VPN (regardless of the number of simultaneous connections).\n\nDepending on how the VPN on the router is configured, VPN routers are divided into three types.\n\nCurrently, ExpressVPN is offering the possibility of purchasing a physical VPN router (that is a router with a pre-installed VPN). You can also choose to configure your router manually. The routers compatible with ExpressVPN are the following: Asus, DD-WRT, D-Link, FlashRouters, Linksys, Netduma, Netgear, Sabai, Tomato, TP-LINK\n\nAlthough VyprVPN does not offer routers with pre-installed software, it does offer an application so that you can install it on your router. To do you, before anything else, you are going to have to install the Tomato firmware on your router ( You can click here to see the list of compatible routers) and then the VyprVPN app.\n\nJust like ExpressVPN, PureVPN also offers routers with pre-installed software which can also be configured manually. The compatible routers are the following: DDWRT, Netgear Genie, Asus, Belkin, Tomato, Linksys, TP-link, D-link, MikroTik, Sitecom Gigabit, Saba, TRENDnet\n\nIn China, a large number of websites are blocked, including Google, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and Gmail, among others. Currently, VPNs (virtual private networks) are the most effective way to get around the blocking and to be able to browse the Internet without restrictions.\n\nWhile VPNs are the most effective way of getting around restrictions on Internet use in China, currently, many of them dont work at all or work poorly. Many VPNs that offered good services in the past currently dont work, which means that it is important to have updated, first-hand information on which VPN service is currently offering the best services.\n\nJust like other social networks such as Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, or Instagram, Snapchat is blocked in China. Therefore, if you want to use Snapchat during your stay in China, you will have to have a VPN service to be able to use it.\n\nCurrently, Whatsapp works without problems in China. However, if you want to download the app in China, you will have problems downloading it if you dont have a VPN. Google Play and the iTunes Store tend to have quite a few problems.\n\nThe majority of Western social networks such as Instagram are blocked in China, which means that if you want to continue to post your photos on Instagram or see the updates of the people you are following, your only option is to use a VPN or similar service.\n\nSince 2014, Viber, like many other similar services, is blocked in China. Therefore, your only option to access the services of Viber without restrictions during your stay in China is to acquire a service that allows you to get around blocking, such as the VPNs that we suggest in this article.\n\nCurrently, Skype continues to work in China, although often the quality of voice and video calls is quite poor, and these calls may be monitored by third parties. A VPN can help you to improve the quality of Skypes services and avoid being spied on.\n\nAlthough iTunes and the App Store are not blocked in China, a large amount of their content is filtered and therefore not available. In addition, every once in a while, they stop working for a indefinite period of time, which is very annoying if you dont have a system to get around blocking.\n\nFacetime can be used in China without problems. Even so, just like what happens with Skype over certain connections, its performance is far from optimal.\n\nYahoo search is not blocked in China, except for a few local versions such as Yahoo Hong Kong and Yahoo Taiwan. Still, the search results on Yahoo are filtered. Yahoo Mail can be accessed without problems.\n\nCurrently, Quora can be accessed without problems in China. Even so, given the type of website that Quora is, its possible that in the future it will be blocked. Also, its content doesnt appear to be filtered.\n\nYes. Currently, Dropbox cant be accessed in China without a VPN. If you have Dropbox installed on your computer, synchronization wont work either until you connect your VPN.\n\nThe reason for the blocking is probably a business reason, so that preference is given to local cloud storage systems.\n\nFor the time being, LinkedIn is not blocked in China and tends to work without too many problems. Nonetheless, keep in mind that websites hosted outside of China normally load slowly.\n\nDue to legal problems, many VPN services dont offer servers in China. Out of the few VPNs that do offer servers in China, many are virtual and dont work, or if they do work, the speed doesnt let you browse the Chinanet normally. If youre interested in finding out which VPNs offer servers in China that work, you can read this article.\n\nThere are very few VPNs that work in China, and they are constantly blocked every time the Great Firewall of China is updated, which means that if you do find one, it will likely stop working soon. Plus, using free VPNs can be risky, as is explained in this article dedicated to analyzing free VPNs.','2017-03-25 03:51:11'),(2,1,'005d445fa9e87175d8b3ed8d6dbca5be401f368b2fefae9bb31a4a45dd669798','9dbad7074f9f4b7abce87159874ec897','','','People in one tiny part of mainland China will now be able to interact with, and surf, sites such as Facebook and Twitter, as well as read news giants such as The New York Times online. Beijing has announced it is lifting the ban on access to such websites, but only within one area of Shanghai  the new free-trade zone  the South China Morning Post reported.\n\nFacebook and Twitter have been banned on mainland China since 2009, and now the Shanghai free-trade zone is set to be the first Hong Kong-like free trade area in mainland China.\n\nThe new zone, which the State Council in China approved in late August, will cover an expanse of 28.78 sq km in the Shanghais Pudong New Area.\n\nThe South China Morning Post today ran what it termed an exclusive, citing that sites such as the online portal of The New York Times, social networking site Facebook and microblogging site Twitter would all be accessible in this new Shanghai zone.\n\nThat paper also reported that government sources \"informed of the decision\" said \"on condition of anonymity\" that the first such zone on mainland China would also be open to bids from foreign telecommunications companies for licences to provide internet services within this new economic zone.\n\nThe newspaper claimed that mainland Chinas three biggest telecommunications companies  China Telecom, China Mobile, and China Unicom  incidentally, all State-owned enterprises  have already been told that foreign telcos will be given the opportunity to compete with them in order to win business in the Shanghai free-trade zone.\n\nUp to now, Beijing, it would appear, has been keeping a tight rein over public access to online media channels.\n\nAccording to the South China Morning Post, Beijing has up to now blocked access to several internet websites through the Great Firewall of China. This is the informal name for the Golden Shield project. In China, it is run by the Ministry of Public Security.','2017-03-25 03:51:11'),(3,1,'005d445fa9e87175d8b3ed8d6dbca5be401f368b2fefae9bb31a4a45dd669798','41e4a3fe8ce0487cb523e9a82bc61aca','','','More than half of the users of the most popular social medium in the world believe that Facebook does a sacred job of connecting people all around the world. Every once in a while, we hear a story of Facebook connecting long lost families and creating new friendships on different continents.\n\n This would indeed be a great story if there was not for politics to meddle. Many a countries in the world have governments that lead pretty closed politics, which means that connecting with people around the world is not possible, thus Facebook cannot be accessed from those countries.\n\nWell, the reasons are all really different and vary from country to country. One of the most popular reasons is to deny the right of the citizens to publicly express their opinions and their dissatisfaction with the government. This was an example in China, when Facebook and Twitter were blocked due to the fact that many Chinese protesters against government uploaded pictures of riots, which could have destabilized it.\n\n Of course, China is not the only country which blocked Facebook, and we shall see a timeline of countries that blocked (even temporarily) or discussed blocking Facebook as well as the reason why they did it.\n\nOne of the first bigger incidents that happened was the creation of fake profile page of the Prime Minister of Mauritius. This resulted in one of the first known Facebook blockages in the world, and it lasted forwell  one day. The Information and Communication Technologies of Mauritius thus proved that they have an active control of the things happening in this country and its users on Facebook.\n\nSyria was also very quick in banning Facebook and the excuse was the concern for the possible attacks that may be organized on the authorities. The ban was ended in 2011.\n\nThe second big incident happened in Morocco, when someone created a fake Facebook profile of Moroccan Prince. However, Facebook was not banned, but heavily controlled. Furthermore, websites such as YouTube, Skype and Google Earth have been banned and un banned periodically.\n\nAfter the elections in Iran, Facebook was seen as a threat and the government thought that it is used for growing the opposition stronger. Therefore, in 2009, Facebook was officially banned from the country. It all lasted for 4 years, until something happened and Facebook and Twitter were suddenly available to all of the citizens. This was very strange, because there was no notice about it. Many people believe that it is some kind of a glitch that happened and allowed Facebook. However, restrictions regarding the internet in Iran are still very high.\n\nChina officially blocked Facebook in July 2009. Since then, Facebook was never activated again, although many people find different ways to access it. The reason for blocking it was a riot that happened in rmqi. Facebook was the main platform through which the protestors communicated and organized events.\n\n Since then, there were many attempts to bring Facebook to China, especially due to the fact that Mark Zuckerberg is married to a Chinese. However, since then, China remains the main enemy to Facebook Empire, with its Great Firewall of China blocking the way.\n\nEgypt also blocked Facebook for a few days during the riots that took place all over the country. Although Facebook is available now, the whole internet freedom is questionable in Egypt, as it is marked as partly free.\n\nAlthough never officially blocked nor banned in Germany, Facebook was a discussion topic in Germanys government two times. The first time, the government just wanted to ban event creation on Facebook due to the fact that open events were (as a joke) attended by thousands of people, who actually attended the event in real life.\n\n The second time Facebook was discussed was after the refugee crisis, when right wing nationalists started organizing events on Facebook and growing stronger. However, this issue still is not solved and we are yet to expect what German government will do on that matter.\n\nMalaysian government also blocked Facebook for the couple of days, during the protests that happened in Egypt.\n\nThe blocking of Facebook never happened in UK, but many groups and pages were deleted by the government in the period of the royal wedding. These were mainly political activists who worried about the governments spending cuts.\n\nDue to a difficult political and religious situation in Bangladesh, Facebook was banned for the first time in 2013, when many people, including an atheist blogger Ahmed Rajib Haider, lost their lives. The second time, Facebook was banned in 2015 and it has remained out of the reach of Bangladesh citizens since then.\n\nAlthough North Korea issued an official statement in 2016 which bans this social medium, Facebook (and most of the Internet freedom, for that matter) was never actually allowed due to the very difficult political situation that exists in North Korea. The statement says that anyone who is caught using Facebook will be punished (whatever the punishment may be). Most of the citizens there have a very limited access to the internet, which is heavily controlled by the government.\n\nVietnam also blocked Facebook for 2 weeks, during the protest in Viettnam. Many protesters are said to have organized the event on Facebook.\n\nA VPN service, such as LimeVPN will definitely help you overcome this ban anywhere in the world. VPN services are usually used not only for this, but for increasing overall security and anonymity on the internet. What you will get is the access to all of the banned and restricted websites in that country without the fear of being tracked or exposed to any of the surveillance systems.\n\n All you need to do is to register for a VPN and choose the monthly plan that you want to use. After that, follow the instructions on how to set it up and you will be enjoying connecting with millions of people worldwide.\n\n Is VPN illegal? No. All of the countries do not have laws regarding a VPN and you are free to use it as much as you want.\n\nFacebook restriction does not only work on the country level but also on the level of institutions. Therefore, some of the schools and work places are being hit by a Facebook block. Officials believe that if Facebook is blocked, the students will focus on studying and the workers on working.\n\n However, these kinds of blocks can also be overcome by using a Virtual Private Network, which was mentioned before.\n\n To sum up, Facebooks goal is to connect all the people in the world, but they fail to do that because of the problems that may arise. Most of the problems were government-oriented and, as you saw above, most of the reasons why Facebook was blocked were due to governments and leaders feeling threatened by protestors. The Facebook blocking is currently critical in China and whether Mark Zuckerberg is going to succeed in his mission is still a mystery.\n\nStaying safe on Public Wifi   All About Open VPN   How to use VPN with TOR','2017-03-25 03:51:11'),(4,1,'005d445fa9e87175d8b3ed8d6dbca5be401f368b2fefae9bb31a4a45dd669798','8d06f609c4474665887d5a487061edb9','','','The headline was worthy of a double take, and the article read like a dispatch from a not-too-distant, perhaps dystopian future: Peoples Daily deputy editor in chief: Our number of Facebook fans second only to the New York Times. The famously red mouthpiece of Chinas Communist Party was claiming in a June 27 Chinese-language article that the popularity of its English-language Facebook page had overtaken those of the Wall Street Journal and USA Today. It quoted its own deputy editor in chief, Lu Xinning, telling a media forum in Russia that the paper had 4.6 million fans on Facebook, even though the social media platform is blocked in China. (The total is now 5.7 million.) The achievement, she said, showed how social media was upending the old pecking order, letting some papers overtake their rivals like cars on a winding road. But a closer look suggests the state-funded Dailys Facebook genuine fan base, which only surpassed 1,000 inApril 2013, is not as large as the numbers make it seem.\n\nIt may appear strange that the paper would boast of its popularity on an American website that Chinese are forbidden to visit. But its U.S. social media footprintis not for Chinese audiences. Run by the papers bureau in New York City, the Dailys Facebook page is essentially a form of advertising for its English-language service and for China itself. China is keen to project soft power through overseas Chinese-language learning centers known as Confucius Institutes but also via its media outlets, including the Peoples Daily, China Daily, and China Central Television. The Facebook page of the Peoples Daily offers a curated selection of news items that leans toward the odd and the international, much of it casting China in a positive light. Recent articles include a look at the favorite foods of foreign leaders (spoiler alert: U.S. President Barack Obama likes pizza), coverage of an underwater kissing contest in Shanghai, and photos of attractive young people participating in the Bubble Run, a sudsy 5K in the western city of Xian, which the paper claims (without citation) is regarded as the most fun 5K run in the world.\n\nThe Dailys English-language Facebook page has only recently exploded in popularity. On April 6, the page had around2,997,000 fans and was nearly neck and neck with USA Todays page, which had around2,953,000 fans, according to Socialbakers.com, a site that tracks Facebooks user data. But between April and the end of June, the Daily surged ahead. By July 5, it had almost doubled its fan base and was up to around5,743,000 fans, while USA Today was trailing with around3,159,000. Contrary to the deputy editor in chiefs claim that the page was second only to the New York Times, there are plenty of other media outlets with more fans on Facebook, including National Geographic and Playboy. But it is nonetheless true that the Daily has more Facebook fans than the Wall Street Journal, the Washington Post, and many other venerated global news outlets. The Socialbakers site shows the Daily ranked 25th on a list of global print media Facebook pages.\n\nThe sudden growth of the Dailys fan base and the geographic distribution of those fans raises questions about whether the paper looked to click farms, many of which are located in Southeast Asia, to help populate its millions of new fans. Click farms are businesses that sell social media likes, fans, and comments to help give clients the illusion of greater popularity. Click farms use fake computer generated Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram accounts, but also human employees with real accounts who like pages or become online fans.\n\nTheres a fine line between garden-variety advertising and shadier practices. In July 2013, the U.S. State Department revealed after an internal audit that it had spent $630,000 on a campaign that some employees inside the agency considered equivalent to buying likes. Sometimes the distinction is obvious. A service helpfully called WeSellLikes.com advertises a package of 25,000 worldwide Facebook likes for just $599.99. Italian cybersecurity researchers Andrea Stroppa and Carlo De Micheli estimated in a 2013 report on click farms that the business of fake Facebook activity was worth about $200 million a year. Stroppa told Foreign Policy that the industry relies on English-speaking youth in countries like Indonesia, Pakistan, and India who spend their days online. They get some pennies to like Facebook pages and to comment on Instagram pictures, he said via Skype from Italy.\n\nAccording to Socialbakers.com, more than 50 percent of the Dailys fans come from Pakistan, India, Indonesia, and Nepal. These are countries that Stroppa said are known click farm hubs. Indeed, Peoples Daily fan numbers in those countries have climbed sharply over the last few months, while pages of competing media sites like USA Today and the Wall Street Journal did not. Nepal is a revealing case. The Daily has around half a million fans in Nepal, according to Socialbakers, a number that represents about 9 percent of the papers total Facebook fan base. Thats a huge number for a country of 27 million where just over onethird of the population is online. Nepal added 307,671 new Daily fans between March 9 and June, Socialbakers shows, a relatively short span of time during which Nepal experienced its worst natural disaster in decades, the April 25 earthquake. During that same window of time, according to the same data, the New York Times added just 2,436 Nepalese fans, the Times of India just 3,224.\n\nThe New York office of the Peoples Daily Online referred questions about the pages sudden popularity to headquarters in Beijing; FP submitted an email query but did not receive a reply. Facebook did not respond to an email query about the Dailys Facebook page.\n\nFP reached out to several Pakistani fans of the Dailys Facebook page. Umar Saeed, an engineering student in Multan, Pakistan, said via Facebook Messenger that he genuinely liked the Daily and its posts. They show the economical as well as structural progress of the great country, Saeed wrote. I like that page bcz i [sic] am from Pakistan and we love Chinese people here. (Pakistan has a strong relationship with China.) He said he has been on Facebook for five years and has never been paid to like a page. Another fan, Sohali Khan, made small talk via messenger but dodged questions about the Peoples Daily and click farms. Stroppa, the Italian researcher, said he has interacted with many people on social media that he suspected of being click farm employees, but that its hard to be certain. Theres no obvious difference between a genuinely active Facebook fan and someone who is getting paid to be one. The big picture, however, is a little easier to discern. Either China is the new master of journalism or what we are seeing is evidence of something not quite right, Stroppa said. He estimated that it would have cost the Daily between $20,000 and $100,000 to amass 3 million paid Facebook fans over the last few months.\n\nFor their part, Chinese readers are generally either incredulous or irritated that a standard bearer for Chinas tightly controlled media regime has been crowing about its global popularity on a website that censors have blocked domestically. One netizen on Weibo, Chinas social media platform, wrote sardonically in response, I would like to report the Peoples Daily for illegally scaling the Great Firewall. The Great Firewall refers to Chinas extensive use of website blocks and content filters to prevent Chinese from navigating to sites that the government considers too politically sensitive, pornographic, or defamatory. Another wrote, tongue in cheek, I would just like to know how the Peoples Daily got on Facebook. Does the government know? Perhaps fittingly, those comments were later censored.\n\nCorrection, July 7, 2015: The name of the Italian researcher is Carlo De Micheli.

China prefers local companies over foreign firms and often puts restrictions on foreign firms to protect homegrown talent. For example, there is a limit on the number of Hollywood movies that can be shown per year, so only the biggest names come to China and the domestic movie industry and grow. Same goes for the internet. China wants its domestic firms to develop and not get shouted out by multi-billion dollar Giants.\n\nChina likes to control the message and censor the media, some foreign companies play ball (Yahoo! and Microsoft) while others refuse (Google, Twitter, Wikipedia[1]). Google used to comply with Chinese censorship, then suddenly it withdrew and redirected all its search traffic to their Hong Kong site instead of the .cn site.\n\nAnother point to make is that Facebook et al. might not care that they are blocked. Google still does business in China. They have offices in Beijing and they sell advertising to Chinese firms. Likewise Facebook\'s CEO, Mark Zuckerberg is no stranger to China, he has even learned the Chinese language to an acceptably high level. He has discussed/made major deals with Chinese internet firms.\n\nThere are two ways to enter a foreign market. You can take your own brand into the country and try to eek out a bit of the market share over many years, or you can just buy into one of the existing players in that country and get instant market share. Even when Google was in China, it didn\'t have the success that has had elsewhere. Yahoo has been in China for a very long time but has always struggled to capture the market even back when Yahoo was bigger than Google (remember then). Facebook also was never really popular in China. Facebook may have more success in the Chinese market by taking a stake in Chinese social media firms in just the same way that Yahoo has a huge stake in Alibaba.\n\n[1]Wikipedia? but that isn\'t blocked is it.

As of May 2016, the only countries to ban access around the clock to the social networking site are China, Iran, and North Korea. However, since the vast majority of North Korean residents do not have access to the internet, in reality China and Iran are the only countries where access to Facebook is actively restricted in a wholesale manner.\n\nBangladesh banned Facebook for a short period of time among the four nations including Iran,China & North Korea. The Awami League-led government of Bangladesh announced a countrywide ban on Facebook and other social network websites. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina proposed the establishment of an Internet monitoring committee with the help of Bangladesh\'s intelligence services. Previously the government has been blocking websites. Right-wing political parties and groups in Bangladesh have been protesting bloggers and others they consider \"blasphemous\"; at the time of the proposal, eight secularists had been murdered by extremists in the country, including atheist blogger Ahmed Rajib Haider, who was fatally stabbed in February 2013. National riots over country\'s war crimes trials have killed 56 people between 19 January 2013 and 2 March 2013.[5][6][7]\n\nOn 18 November 2015, the same Awami League government banned Facebook again on the eve of the final judgement of Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami leader Ali Ahsan Muhammad Mujahid and Bangladesh Nationalist Party leader Salauddin Kader Chowdhury. Both the politicians and previous minister have been issued a death sentence by the War Criminals Tribunal and the review board of the Supreme Court of Bangladesh has finally given their judgement in favour of the previously given one.\n\nThe Bangladesh Government lifted the ban on 20 December 2015 after about 22 days only.It was not that typical type of Ban but only to handle the situation when the rumours spreaded through social medias.This lifting of the ban has made the users happy again.\n\nIn China, Facebook was blocked following the July 2009 rmqi riots[2] because Xinjiang independence activists were using Facebook as part of their communications network.[8] Some Chinese users also believed that Facebook would not succeed in China after Google China\'s problems.[9] The popular Renren social network (formerly Xiaonei) has many features similar to Facebook, and complies with PRC Government regulations regarding content filtering.\n\nAs of 20 August 2013, there have been reports of Facebook being partially unblocked in China.[10] But according to the \"Blocked in China\" website, Facebook is still blocked.[11] However, it is not blocked in Hong Kong and Taiwan. It is possible to access Facebook in the Shanghai Free Trade Zone.[12]\n\nFacebook was blocked for a few days in Egypt during the 2011 Egyptian protests.[13]\n\nIn July 2011, authorities in Germany began to discuss the prohibition of events organized on Facebook. The decision is based on numerous cases of overcrowding by people who were not originally invited.[14][15] In one instance, 1,600 \"guests\" attended the 16th birthday party for a Hamburg girl who accidentally posted the invitation for the event as public. After reports of overcrowding, more than a hundred police were deployed for crowd control. A police officer was injured and eleven participants were arrested for assault, property damage and resistance to authorities.[16] In another unexpectedly overcrowded event, 41 young people were arrested and at least 16 injured.[17]\n\nIn 2015, during the refugee crisis with large numbers of immigrants entering the country unregulated, a broad discussion about the problems of mass immigration and politics of the actual government took place in social media. In this situation a campaign was started to force Facebook to erase right wing hate speech. Early in 2016, a Bertelsmann company called \"Arvato\" was mandated to erase comments and contents from Facebook.[18] Rules and procedure for that censorship, as well as the juridical base is not clear at the moment (January 2016).\n\nAfter the 2009 election in Iran, the website was banned because of fears that opposition movements were being organized on the website.[3] However, after four years of the blocking of Facebook website, as of September 2013, the blocking of both Twitter and Facebook was thought to have been lifted without notice.[19] Iranians lost unrestricted access to Facebook and Twitter the next day, leaving many people wondering whether the opening was deliberate or the result of some technical glitch.[20]\n\nFacebook was blocked for a few days in Malaysia during the 2011 Egyptian protests.[13]\n\nThe Information and Communication Technologies Authority (ICTA) of Mauritius, ordered Internet Service Providers(ISPs) of the country to ban Facebook on immediate effect, on the 8 November 2007 because of a fake profile page of the Prime Minister. Access to Facebook was restored on the next day.[21][22][23]\n\nOn February 5, 2008, Fouad Mourtada, a citizen of Morocco, was arrested for the alleged creation of a faked Facebook profile of Prince Moulay Rachid of Morocco.[24][25]\n\nFrom April 2016, North Korea starts to block Facebook, for \"move underscoring its concern with the spread of online information\".

The groups and pages were mostly concerned with opposition to government spending cuts, and many were used to organize demonstrations in a continuation of the 2010 UK student protests.[29][30][31] The censorship of the pages coincided with a series of pre-emptive arrests of known activists.[32] Amongst the arrestees were a street theater group planning an effigy beheading performance in opposition to the monarchy.[33]\n\nA Facebook spokesman said the pages were disabled as part of a routine sweep because they were created with fake personal profiles, a violation of the companys term of service. In this case a number of the Facebook personal profile pages represented causes, rather than real people.

Emilio, who holds a masters degree in City and Regional Planning from Berkeley and a bachelors degree in Urban Studies from Stanford, can be contacted on or by .\n\nDuring her career in government, Hillary Clinton has routinely prioritized the interests of corporate profiteers while neglecting the rights of workers. Her support of so-called free trade agreements in particular illustrates where her priorities lie.\n\nWhile in the Senate, for example, Clinton backed agreements with Chile, Singapore, and Oman despite their clear lack of labor protections. As David Sirota and Matthew Cunningham-Cook for the International Business Times:\n\nIn some cases, Clinton even directly worked against improved labor standards for workers in other countries. In , Dan Coughlin and Kim Ives utilize content from cables obtained by WikiLeaks to describe how Secretary Clintons State Department lobbied the Haitian president to help multinational clothing retailers undermine a minimum wage increase unanimously passed by the Haitian Parliament:\n\nContractors for Fruit of the Loom, Hanes and Levis worked in close concert with the US Embassy when they aggressively moved to block a minimum wage increase for Haitian assembly zone workers, the lowest-paid in the hemisphere, according to secret State Department cables. The factory owners told the Haitian Parliament that they were willing to give workers a 9-cents-per-hour pay increase to 31 cents per hour to make T-shirts, bras and underwear for US clothing giants like Dockers and Nautica. But the factory owners refused to pay 62 cents per hour, or $5 per day, as a measure unanimously passed by the Haitian Parliament in June 2009 would have mandated. And they had the vigorous backing of the US Agency for International Development and the US Embassy when theytook that stand. To resolve the impasse between the factory owners and Parliament, the State Department urged quick intervention by then Haitian President Ren Prval. A more visible and active engagement by Prval may be critical to resolving the issue of the minimum wage and its protest spin-offor risk the political environment spiraling out of control, argued US Ambassador Janet Sanderson in a June 10, 2009, cable back to Washington. Two months later Prval negotiated a deal with Parliament to create a two-tiered minimum wage increaseone for the textile industry at about $3 per day and one for all other industrial and commercial sectors at about $5 per day.\n\nClintons record is very similar when it comes to the most recent free trade agreement  the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). The TPP has been the subject of well-deserved scrutiny, and not just from liberals like the Economic Policy Institutes , Senators and , and former US Labor Secretaries F. Ray Marshall and Robert Reich. Former US Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, the economist famous for, among many things, his role in the deregulation of the US financial system, has also raised doubts about the merits of the agreement. Heres Summers in a for The Washington Post:\n\nFirst, the era of agreements that achieve freer trade in the classic sense is essentially over. The worlds remaining tariff and quota barriers are small and, where present, less reflections of the triumph of protectionist interests and more a result of deep cultural values such as the Japanese attachment to rice farming A reflexive presumption in favor of free trade should not be used to justify further agreements. Concerns that trade agreements may be a means to circumvent traditional procedures for taking up issues ranging from immigration to financial regulation must be taken seriously [The US economy] has supported the greatest economic progress in the history of the world in emerging markets and is working spectacularly well for capital and a cosmopolitan elite that moves easily around the world. But being pressed down everywhere are middle classes who lack the wherewithal to take advantage of new global markets and do not want to compete with low-cost foreign labor. Our challenge now is less to increase globalization than to make the globalization we have work for our citizens.\n\nIn that respect, the TPP doesnt look good. Scott discusses how free trade has historically depressed US wages and why the lack of enforceable currency provisions in the agreement could lead to job losses. Reich and Marshall caution that its patent provisions risk delaying or even preventing generic competition, thus keeping lifesaving medicine out of patients hands. Warren details how the agreements Investor State Dispute Settlement (ISDS) provisions would allow big multinationals to weaken labor and environmental rules and why, despite the fact that the TPP is being hailed as the strongest free trade agreement yet, our terrible enforcement record when it comes to previous agreements (and the same empty promise being made over and over again) belies that claim.\n\nWhat does all of that have to do with Clinton? As Sirota and Cunningham-Cook note, Clinton was a strong supporter of the TPP during negotiations:\n\nBut that was just one speech, right? Wrong.\n\nIn a , Clinton explicitly promoted the TPP as an initiative that will lower barriers, raise standards, and drive long-term growth across the region. She also used the collective we in describing the work being done on the pact, saying, we are making progress toward finalizing a far-reaching new trade agreement called the Trans-Pacific Partnership. She also saidwe are offering to assist with capacity building, so that every country in ASEAN can eventually join. The video of the key part of her speech can be seen here:\n\nIn fact, even CNN, which judging from the recent Democratic primary debate seems to unabashedly favor Clinton, published an article listing 45 times that Secretary Clinton pushed the very trade bill that she now claims to oppose\n\nHer flip-flop, as Sirota and Cunningham-Cook note, is typical:\n\nThough she has tried to justify her reversal this time around, her claims are unconvincing.As at Vox:\n\nWhy not?Because, as Lee describes, the pharmaceutical language in the TPP is better than expected and currency manipulation was never going to be part of the TPP. If Clinton was serious when she lauded the gold standard TPP for free, transparent, fair trade in 2012, she should be even more supportive of the deal now. Instead, the minute that the TPP became widely unpopular, she changed her position, saying that it didnt meet the high bar she had set for it.\n\nI can only draw three logical conclusions from these remarkable contradictions:\n\nUnfortunately, none of these conclusions give me any reassurance that it would be a good idea to entrust Clinton with more political power.','2017-03-25 03:51:11'),(10,2,'02de749f780592f581ac0d1dc2bedbd42ee0b170cce6f5535d1d99c14499a15c','b6dd6a8991fa4d4b9b5e53ecb927c647','','','Donald Trump has made opposition to multilateral trade deals like the North American Free Trade Agreement and the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership a staple of his case against Hillary Clinton. And he quickly took the conversation there Monday.\n\nHe says she supported the former, whichthe U.S.entered into during her husbands administration, and the latter, which she helped negotiate as secretary of State.\n\nIn fact, Trump argued, Clinton decided to oppose TPP only after she saw the popularresponse Trump was getting for his position.\n\nBut Clinton has maintained she opposes TPP, a position she has been forced to reiterate with greater clarity.\n\nI will stop any trade deal that kills jobs or holds down wages including the Trans-Pacific Partnership, she said at a campaign stop in Ohio in August. I oppose it now, Ill oppose it after the election, and Ill oppose it as president.\n\nSo did Clinton flip on TPP? Context is key.\n\nThe deal would be the largest multilateral trade agreement ever negotiated, involving the U.S.,emerging economies such asVietnam andtraditional trading partners includingJapan, Canada and Mexico. Its a major priority for the Obama administration, which sees the deal as key to cementing the presidents so-called pivot to the Asia-Pacific region. Obama hopes to persuade lawmakers to ratify it before years end, but Clintons opposition now exemplifies the political difficulty.\n\nAs a member of the Obama Cabinet in his first term, Clinton carried out the presidentspriorities.Speaking on a trip to Australia in 2012 as negotiators from the partner nations were still deep in negotiations, she outlined the goals for it.\n\nThis TPP sets the gold standard in trade agreements to open free, transparent, fair trade, the kind of environment that has the rule of law and a level playing field, she said then. And when negotiated, this agreement will cover 40%of the world\'s total trade and build in strong protections for workers and the environment. That\'s keybecause we know from experience, and of course research proves it, that respecting workers\' rights leads to positive long-term economic outcomes, better jobs with higher wages and safer working conditions.\n\nAfter she left the Obama administration, Clintons rhetoric shifted more to express her own views. In her 2014 memoir, Hard Choices, she wrote about the administrations renewed engagement with Vietnam and said the TPP was one of our most important tools for doing so.\n\nOur country has learned the hard way over the past several decades that globalization and the expansion of international trade brings costs as well as benefits, she wrote, while noting that she and Obama had both promised in the 2008 campaign to pursue smarter, fairer trade agreements.\n\nBecause TPP negotiations are still ongoing, it makes sense to reserve judgment until we can evaluate the final agreement, she added. Its safe to say that the TPP wont be perfect  but its higher standards, if implemented and enforced, should benefit American businesses and workers.\n\nFinal negotiations on the deal concluded in October 2015, just as the scope of the challenge Clinton faced in the Democratic primaries became clearer. Her main rival, VermontSen. Bernie Sanders, quickly vowed to block the deal. Clinton ultimately stated her opposition after taking time to study it.\n\nI still believe in the goal of a strong and fair trade agreement in the Pacific as part of a broader strategy both at home and abroad, just as I did when I was secretary of State, she said in a statement. But the bar here is very high and, based on what I have seen, I don\'t believe this agreement has met it.\n\nAs a senator, Clinton voted against the only multilateral trade agreement that was considered during her tenure: the Central American Free Trade Agreement. She did support separate bilateral agreements with Chile, Singapore, Australia, Morocco, Bahrain and Oman, according to Politifact.\n\nFor more 2016 campaign coverage, follow @mikememoli on Twitter\n\nObama tries to sell the Pacific trade pact to nations concerned about its fate\n\nObama\'s Pacific trade deal becomes a surprising political casualty of 2016 campaign','2017-03-25 03:51:11'),(11,2,'02de749f780592f581ac0d1dc2bedbd42ee0b170cce6f5535d1d99c14499a15c','5a8d9cf032d54d528a1c8d79bac3cc1c','','','Can you imagine free web hosting service that has 99.9% uptime?

My standards for more new, good jobs for Americans, for raising wages for Americans. And I want to make sure that I can look into the eyes of any middle-class American and say, this will help raise your wages. And I concluded I could not.\"\n\nClintons phrasing -- that she said she \"hoped it would be the gold standard\" -- implies that she was undecided on the TPP. But that doesnt exactly match up to her prior comments. We found that her previous remarks actually gave the impression that she had confidence in the deal as it stood.\n\nIn Australia in 2012, Clinton delivered remarks on the general topic of the U.S.-Australia relationship. Heres everything she said about the TPP in that address, with the \"gold standard\" comment in bold.\n\n\"So it\'s fair to say that our economies are entwined, and we need to keep upping our game both bilaterally and with partners across the region through agreements like the Trans-Pacific Partnership or TPP. Australia is a critical partner. This TPP sets the gold standard in trade agreements to open free, transparent, fair trade, the kind of environment that has the rule of law and a level playing field. And when negotiated, this agreement will cover 40 percent of the world\'s total trade and build in strong protections for workers and the environment.\"\n\nSo it seems Clinton is saying the TPP does, definitevely set the gold standard -- as opposed to Clinton hoping it will.\n\nIn other addresses around the same time, she expressed similar assuredness that the TPP would meet a high standard. In November 2012 remarks in Singapore, she encouraged all nations \"willing to meet 21st century standards as embodied in the TPP\" to join the deal.\n\n\"The so-called TPP will lower barriers, raise standards, and drive long-term growth across the region. It will cover 40 percent of the world\'s total trade and establish strong protections for workers and the environment. Better jobs with higher wages and safer working conditions, including for women, migrant workers and others too often in the past excluded from the formal economy will help build Asia\'s middle class and rebalance the global economy. Canada and Mexico have already joined the original TPP partners. We continue to consult with Japan. And we are offering to assist with capacity building, so that every country in ASEAN can eventually join. We welcome the interest of any nation willing to meet 21st century standards as embodied in the TPP, including China.\"\n\nHere are some of the other words Clinton used to describe the TPP before she left the State Department in 2013: \"exciting,\" \"innovative,\" \"ambitious,\" \"groundbreaking,\" \"cutting-edge,\" \"high-quality\" and \"high-standard.\" (To read more of her comments in full, check out our previous article on this subject.)\n\nAs a presidential candidate Clinton has used more hedging language, for example saying she has \"some concerns,\" and now she has said she outright doesnt support the deal as it stands.\n\nIn her 2014 memoir Hard Choices, she wrote:\n\n\"Because TPP negotiations are still ongoing, it makes sense to reserve judgment until we can evaluate the final proposed agreement. Its safe to say the TPP wont be perfect -- no deal negotiated among a dozen countries ever will be -- but its higher standards, if implemented and enforced, should benefit American businesses and workers.\"\n\nIn fairness to Clinton, the TPP was still under negotiation when Clinton made the \"gold standard\" comment. The partners only finalized the deal this year. Its quite possible the deal looks dramatically different than it did at the early stages of negotiations, when Clinton was at the State Department -- something Clinton spokesman Nick Merrill pointed out to us for this fact-check. The negotiations have been conducted in secret, so its hard for us to assess that ourselves. Also, as secretary of state, she spoke as a representative of the Obama administration, which was and remains wholeheartedly in favor of the deal.\n\nClinton said when she was secretary of state, she was reserving judgment but \"hoped (the Trans-Pacific Partnership) would be the gold standard.\"\n\nShes twisting her 2012 remarks a bit. Clinton said, \"This TPP sets the gold standard in trade agreements,\" which is a more confident claim than if she had said she \"hoped\" it would meet that standard. This is in contrast to more recent comments where Clinton said she had concerns about the deal and that she ultimately opposes it.\n\nThe statement is distorting her previous comments. We rate it Half True.','2017-03-25 03:51:11'),(13,2,'02de749f780592f581ac0d1dc2bedbd42ee0b170cce6f5535d1d99c14499a15c','9bc600d62aab4a559abebcd638685029','','','Hillary Clinton once lauded the Trans-Pacific Partnership (which she later opposed) as setting the \"gold standard\" in trade agreements.\n\nAmong the various accusations exchanged by the two candidates during the first presidential debate between Democrat Hillary Clinton and Republican Donald Trump on 26 September 2016 was Trumps assertionthat Clinton laudedthe multi-nation trade agreement known as the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) as the gold standard of such deals:\n\nTRUMP: Your husband signed NAFTA, which was one of the worst things that ever happened to the manufacturing industry. CLINTON: Well, thats your opinion. That is your opinion. TRUMP: You go to New England, you go to Ohio, Pennsylvania, you go anywhere you want, Secretary Clinton, and you will see devastation where manufacture is down 30, 40, sometimes 50 percent. NAFTA is the worst trade deal maybe ever signed anywhere, but certainly ever signed in this country. And now you want to approve Trans-Pacific Partnership. You were totally in favor of it. Then you heard what I was saying, how bad it is, and you said, I cant win that debate. But you know that if you did win, you would approve that, and that will be almost as bad as NAFTA. Nothing will ever top NAFTA. CLINTON: Well, that is just not accurate. I was against it once it was finally negotiated and the terms were laid out. I wrote about that in TRUMP: You called it the gold standard. You called it the gold standard of trade deals. You said its the finest deal youve ever seen. TRUMP: And then you heard what I said about it, and all of a sudden you were against it. CLINTON: Well, Donald, I know you live in your own reality, but that is not the facts. The facts are  I did say I hoped it would be a good deal, but when it was negotiated CLINTON:  which I was not responsible for, I concluded it wasnt. I wrote about that in my book\n\nWhat is the TTP? Sometimes described as a much bigger version of NAFTA (certain provisions are meant to be improvementson thoseof NAFTA and would supplant parts of itonce TPP takeseffect), the agreement covers12 Asian-Pacific nations, including the U.S., Canada, and Mexico (but not China), dropstariffs, raises environmental protection and human rights standards, and is supported by the Obama administration. It has not yet been ratified by the United States.\n\nAssecretary of state, Hillary Clinton spoke favorably of the agreement-in-progress on severaloccasions. For example:\n\nWe want to realize the benefits from greater economic integration. In order to do that, we have to be willing to play. To this end, we are working to ratify a free trade agreement with South Korea, were pursuing a regional agreement with the nations of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, and we know that that will help create new jobs and opportunities here at home. (8 September 2010)\n\nAfter leaving the State Department in 2013, however, Clintons remarks about the TPP became more guarded. Because TPP negotiations are still ongoing, she wrote in her 2014 book, Hard Choices,it makes sense to reserve judgment until we can evaluate the final proposed agreement. By the time of her October 2015 debate with Democratic rivalBernie Sanders, Clinton was foursquare against it:\n\nI did say, when I was secretary of state, three years ago, that I hoped it would be the gold standard. It was just finally negotiated last week, and in looking at it, it didnt meet my standards. My standards for more new, good jobs for Americans, for raising wages for Americans. And I want to make sure that I can look into the eyes of any middle-class American and say, This will help raise your wages. And I concluded I could not.\n\nDespite her current opposition to the agreement and herattempts during more than one presidential debate to recast her previous support of itas hopeful, the record shows that Clintonspoke glowinglyof the TPP on more than one occasion, not least when she praisedit in 2012 as setting the gold standard in trade agreements.','2017-03-25 03:51:11'),(14,3,'0455eca4c35e38d5421ffa41eee3bb8c121757afc8aec23fd178faffcafc7bc7','c59beb13f33041bca2d018a5668b6334','','','NACS Storms Capitol Hill\n\nA diverse group of convenience industry professionals spent Wednesday meeting with their legislators in Washington.\n\nMobile Ordering Now Used by Billions\n\nNPD Group says digital foodservice ordering accounts for 1.9 billion of all U.S. foodservice visits.\n\nU.S. Senators Oppose Rollback of Fuel Economy Emissions Standards\n\nSenators say current emissions standards are helping consumers save at the pump, decrease pollution and reduce U.S. reliance on foreign oil.\n\nVerifone Investigating Data Breach\n\nCompany confirms cyber attempt was limited to controllers at about 24 convenience stores.\n\nMars Unveils Easter Candy Line-Up\n\nCandy sales are likely to increase, as this years Easter season is three weeks longer than 2016.\n\nYesway Convenience Stores Say TANK YOU \n\nCustomer appreciation promotion offers deals on in-store purchases for customers at the pump.\n\nIndustry Stakeholders Prepare to Take on Capitol Hill\n\nNew programming at this years NACS Government Relations Conference primed first-time attendees for successful meetings with their legislators.\n\nDay Without a Woman Protest Held Nationwide Today\n\nThe national day of protest coincides with International Womens Day.\n\nAre Gas Stations the New Grocery Stores?\n\nMillennials are using convenience stores to buy essentials.\n\nUsing Trends to Improve Customer Satisfaction\n\nNACS revisits Trendspotting: A Customers Perspective from the 2016 Show in a webinar form.\n\nIndiana Convenience Stores Call Cigarette Tax Hike Proposal Devastating\n\nThe Indiana Grocery and Convenience Store Association warns that such an increase would put state retailers at a huge disadvantage.\n\nU.K. Smoking Numbers Drop\n\nNew data finds that the number of smokers has declined significantly since 2012, along with the daily number of cigarettes smoked.\n\nIndustrys Premier Benchmarking Event Less Than a Month Away\n\nUpcoming NACS State of the Industry Summit is the only event where convenience retailers gain access to the newest metrics, as well as industry trends and opportunities.\n\nSubway Fights Back Against Fake Chicken Claims\n\nAllegation that Canadian locations serve chicken that is 50% chicken is 100% incorrect, says Subway.\n\nAlta Convenience Raises $53,057 for Make-A-Wish\n\nFunds were raised through the Buy-A-Star, Make-A-Wish in-store campaign.\n\nDunkin Donuts Is Removing Artificial Colors\n\nCompany will remove synthetic colorings from its U.S. menu by 2019, beginning with new cream cheese spreads this month.\n\nCannabis Business Could Impact Beer Sales\n\nStudy suggests that legal cannabis sales could take away 7.1% of revenues from the beer industry.\n\nSwipe Fees: What You Need to Know\n\nNACS podcast shares the status of swipe strategies to capture more customers at the pump and get them inside the store.\n\nWawa Brings Back Free Coffee Fridays\n\nDuring March, Wawa Rewards members are treated to free coffee on Fridays.\n\nIntroducing the Sneakers That Order a Pizza\n\nPizza Huts Pie Top sneakers can order pie by pressing a button on the shoes tongue.\n\nPepsiCo Extends Line of 1893 Cola \n\nTwo new flavors will launch this spring.\n\nMcDonalds Heads Back to Its Roots\n\nThe fast-food burger chain has decided to focus on its core products and customers.\n\nNACS Signs Group Letter to EPA Asking for No Change on Point of Obligation\n\nA coalition of 16 organizations urged the new agency head to keep the status quo on the Renewable Fuel Standard.\n\nSenator, or Governor?\n\nIn the past, governors aspired to the Senate, but the trend is beginning to reverse.\n\nNew Mexico Minimum Wage Hike Passes Senate\n\nThe bill would bump the state minimum wage from $7.50 per hour to $9.\n\nCanada Unveils Aggressive Plan to Lower Tobacco Usage\n\nThe government wants less than 5% of Canadians using tobacco by 2035.\n\nSen.

The benefits are expected to be reinstated sometime in 2019, at which point the deficit will be resolved. In order to meet the needs of the new budget and not increase the states deficit of $45 billion, Walker has chosen to temporarily put an end to the FoodShare program. State Representative Brian Dunford (R) says while cuts to the program are difficult to make, he believes they are necessary to move Wisconsin forward.\n\nThe claim caused alarmamongof Wisconsin who relied on government assistance to feed their families. But there are no lawmakers by the name of Brian Dunford in Wisconsin, nor do any additional storiesof what would be a major change to benefit distribution in that state.\n\nAlthough The Boston Tribune (like theBaltimore Gazette) sounds like a real news outlet, it appears to be a new front for hoax purveyorAssociated Media Coverage,a fake news site thattypically spreads fabricationsaboutlaws orstatutes thatwould affect a specific subset of the population.Although many fake orsatirenews sites include disclaimers informing readers their content is fabricated, Associated Media Coverage does not.\n\nPreviousAssociated Media Coveragefalsehoods designed to agitate specific groups of people included animpending motorcyclecurfewin March 2016, a motorcycle speed ban in August 2016, a FDAe-juice banin mid-2016,a looming two pet maximum ordinance in several jurisdictions (leadingmany households to believe they would be forced to rehome beloved pets), and a 50-state ban on open carry.\n\nAssociated Media Coveragefurther expanded its scope into more generallyupsetting (yet humorless) fake news items, such as claims that atransgender bathroom controversy-related shooting resulted in someones death (a story that went up during nationwide debate overthe issue), Casey Anthonyplanned toopen a home daycare center, andthata dead baby was found in a Walmart DVD bin.','2017-03-25 03:51:11'),(19,4,'045972b7662731daba8bad2299c10cb4db8cbec10336df10d66481455261c2b3','141d7d889e304fe5b100574120331abc','','','Africas Deadliest Predators & How To Survive Them\n\nLions are the second largest big cat species in the world after tigers. Adults males can eat up to 88 pounds of meat in one sitting! Thats 44kg  How much do you weigh? A lions roar can be heard from 8 kilometers (5.0 miles) away. Equipped with teeth that tear effortlessly through bone and tendon, lions can take down an animal as large as a bull giraffe. Once grabbed, the prey is subdued and suffocated with a quick neck bite or a sustained bite over the muzzle. How To Survive A Lion Attack: If you encounter a lion, never turn your back and try to run. That is a death warrant. Your best chance is to stand as still as possible, stretch out your arms to look as large as possible, and try to outface the lion!\n\nA crocodile can snap their jaws shut around prey within 50 milliseconds. Crocodiles have the strongest bite of any animal in the world.The muscles that open the jaws, however, arent so powerful. A reasonably strong person could hold a crocodiles jaw closed with their bare hands! Each crocodile jaw has 24 teeth that are meant to grasp and crush, not chew. They swallow stones to grind food inside their stomachs. Crying crocodile tears  displaying fake sadness  comes from the myth that the reptiles weep when eating humans. They do wipe their eyes when feeding, but only because their eyes bubble and froth when eating. How To Survive ACrocodile Attack: Most victims never see the crocodile coming. If caught in its jaws, trying to pull free is usually futile and may induce the crocodile to go into an underwater death roll. The only hope of survival is to fight back. Hit or poke the eyes, the most vulnerable part of a crocodiles body. If that fails, strike the nostrils or ears. As a last ditch attempt, go for the palatal valve  a flap of tissue behind the tongue that covers the crocodiles throat and prevents the animal from drowning. If your arm is stuck in a crocodiles mouth, you may be able to pry this valve down, water will then flow into the crocodiles throat, and hopefully it will let you go.\n\nThe fastest snake in the world, capable of moving at up to 19 km per hour for short distances. Its venom is highly toxic. Two drops of venom can kill a person and a mamba can have up to 20 drops in its fangs. Black mambas get their name because of the black color inside their mouth (their bodies are usually olive brown). Easily identified by its length (2.4m average), slenderness, speed of movement and its coffin-shaped head. The black mamba has a reputation for being very aggressive. How To Survive ABlack Mamba Attack: Untreated bites are fatal. Put a tourniquet above the puncture wound to slow the spread of poison and seek medical attention immediately. The sooner a person is treated after the bite with antidote, the better the chances of survival.\n\nExtremely aggressive if threatened, the hippo is responsible for more human fatalities in Africa than any other large animal. Hippos can easily outrun a human reaching up to 50km per hour. Most common threat display is the yawn, which is telling you to back off! An overheated hippo looks as if it is sweating blood as glands in its skin secrete a sticky red fluid that acts as a natural sunscreen. How To Survive AHippo Attack: Never get between a hippo and water. It panics them and they charge. Most human deaths happen because people surprise hippos accidentally.','2017-03-25 03:51:11'),(20,4,'045972b7662731daba8bad2299c10cb4db8cbec10336df10d66481455261c2b3','70740bd69b1e4b1ca1ffed1c76b0aba8','','','Just how much do big cats have in common with the tabby in your home? We asked Susan Bass, director of public relations at Big Cat Rescue in Tampa, Floridayou know, the place that puts out all those awesome videosto walk us through what behaviors big cats share with their domestic counterparts. (And dont worryweve put in a request for sitting on computers and hanging out in the sink videos.)\n\nIt\'s a scenario familiar to anyone with a kitty: You come home, head to the bathroom ... and find a toilet paper massacre. When the staff at Big Cat Rescue put TP in enclosures of servals, bobcats, lynx, and ocelots, they found that even big cats love to play with white tissue. \"Theyre going to be more curious about anything new in their immediate area,\" Bass says. Also, it\'s just plain fun! (For them. Not for whoever has to clean it up/reroll the toilet paper.)\n\nIf you present a big cat with a box, he\'ll hop in it quicker than you can say Maru. \"Just like domestic cats, big cats like to hide in things,\" Bass says. \"They like to think that they can see out but you cant see ineven though you can!\"\n\nThe cats at Big Cat Rescue are also into bags, though probably not in the same way that domestic cats are. \"We havent tried bags that they can get intoI dont know where we would find one big enough!\" Bass says. \"But we give them paper bags filled with either spices or cologne. Our big cats love Obsession for Men. They just start drooling and rolling over.\"\n\nIf the cats were presented with a bag big enough to get into, Bass says, \"they would probably rip through it.\"\n\nNo feline can resist the \"What is that red dotoh I got itwhere did it go?\" appeal of the laser pointer, big cats included. \"I think they like that it moves really fast,\" Bass says. \"They have to chase it. You can go up a wall, under things, like I do with my cat. Theyre just fascinated with it.\"\n\nDomestic cats spend between 30 and 50 percent of their waking hours grooming; big cats are similarly fastidious about cleaning themselves. \"Its to get all of their scent off of them,\" Bass says. \"In the wild, if theyre lying in wait somewhere, and a gazelle gets a whiff of a tiger downwind, theyre going to run the other way. So cats are constantly are grooming themselves to get rid of any smell that they have.\" Cleaning has a number of other benefits, too; it helps cats get rid of parasites and keeps them cool.\n\nIt\'s all about marking their territory. Both big cats and domestic cats \"have scent glands all overin their faces, especially,\" Bass says. \"So they rub against their things, whether its the side of a couch, the side of the cage, or a tree. Or you!\"\n\nBig cats also scratch to mark their territory. With the exception of lions, which roam in prides, big cats are solitary, Bass says; tiger cubs, for example, will stay with their mothers for just two years before striking out on their own. \"If you are a 2-year-old male tiger and youre wandering through the wild, and you come on these trees where there are claw marks in all the trees about 8 to 10 feet upthats because a tiger will stand on his back legs and put his front paws up as high as possible and scratch right there,\" Bass says. \"Thats telling every tiger that comes into its territory, This is how big I am, I can scratch way up here. If you cant scratch higher, you better keep moving.\'\n\nYour cat meows, chirps, and purrs. Big cats have their own vocalizations, too, and some of them sound kind of similar to the noises your cat makes. \"There are four great catslions, tigers, leopards, and jaguarsand they roar,\" Bass says. \"They have a different bone in their throat that allows them to do that.\" The so-called lesser cats (but come on, we all know there\'s no such thing as \"lesser cats\"), including cougars, lynx, and bobcats, can\'t roar. \"It\'s probably because of where they live,\" Bass says. \"Lions live on the savannahs in Africa. A lions roar can be heard by another lion at least five miles away. They have to be able to do that. A Canadian lynx that lives in the snow in Canada doesn\'t need to roar to get its point across.\"\n\nBut a roar is just one way big cats converse. \"They all talk,\" Bass says. \"They all make different noises.\" The lesser cats can all purr, and tigers make a chuffing noise, \"like a puffing out of their lips,\" Bass says, in greeting. \"Like my tabby cats, big cats will talk to their people. Some cats are very talkative and some dont make very many sounds. One of our cougars, Reise, is really talkative. If you just walk by her, all of a sudden shell be like \'bluh-ruh ruh ruh.\'\" You can watch Reise playing soccer here.\n\nFun fact: The young of the four great cats are called cubs, but the offspring of the lesser cats are called kittens!\n\nOr at least some of them are. Responsiveness to catnip is genetic, and half the domestic cats in the world don\'t respond to it at all. \"Its the same thing with big cats,\" Bass says. \"Some like it much more than others.\" In one test, 18 of the sanctuary\'s 25 cats had a strong reaction to catnip.\n\nYour cat spends most of her day sleeping, and so do her big relativesbetween 16 to 20 hours a day, in fact. \"The reason for that is because in the wild, they are opportunity hunters,\" Bass says. \"They will sprint to catch prey, but theyre not marathon runners. They will sleep to keep their energy intact. They can go from totally asleep to totally awake in a split second if they hear a gazelle go by.\"\n\nSpeaking of hunting: All cats, big and small, will stalk their prey. \"Zabu, our white tiger, is a real stalker,\" Bass says. \"If she sees anyone go by, or golf carts go across, she\'ll stalk them.\"\n\nMy kitten, Pearl, refuses to eat her food in her bowl. Instead, she shovels it onto the ground and then eats it, making a huge mess. (Thanks, Pearl.) Bass says some captive big cats will move their food to the ground to eat, too. \"Some are very food aggressive,\" Bass says. \"If there\'s more than one cat in an enclosure, we separate them before we bring the food by. One will start gobbling it up and then go to the other ones food.\"\n\nAnother weird thing some domestic cats do is paw around their food bowls, which also has its roots in wild cat behavior. In the wild, the cats might only catch something once a week or so, and they won\'t eat it all at once,\" Bass says. \"They want to leave and come back to eat again, so they will actually try and bury their kill so others dont smell it and eat it. Other cats, like leopards, will drag their kill high into a tree, where other not-so-talented climbers (lions in Africa and tigers in Asia) cant go.\n\nBig cats sometimes make biscuits, too! \"It\'s probably for the same reason house cats do it,\" Bass says. \"It\'s natural to do it as they nurse as babies, and sometimes they continue to do it after they are past nursing when they are happy.\"\n\nBoth domestic cats and big cats have an excellent sense of smell. \"Humans smell in parts per thousand, while cats smell in parts per million,\" Bass says. And if they smell something really strong, they\'ll open up their mouths to get a better whiffan act the staff at Big Cat Rescue call \"stinky face.\" \"Opening their mouth helps them smell it better than just out of their nose,\" Bass says.','2017-03-25 03:51:11'),(21,4,'045972b7662731daba8bad2299c10cb4db8cbec10336df10d66481455261c2b3','b415fe4dff49487a9acdacd7ac03de74','','','The four big cats that actually roar are the lion, tiger, leopard and jaguar, with lions being the most vocal. These four cats have been assigned to the genus Panthera because they can roar. Roaring is made possible by a special two-piece hyoid bone in the throat. All of the non-roaring cats have a one-piece hyoid bone. It is said that a lion\'s roar can be heard 5 miles (8 km) away.','2017-03-25 03:51:11'),(22,4,'045972b7662731daba8bad2299c10cb4db8cbec10336df10d66481455261c2b3','fffba938b38f4f34a865497e527f0595','','','You dont mess up with the king of the jungle.\n\nThis is a fact that you think people would already know by now but no, this girl had to annoy a lion. This happened at Tucson, Arizonas Reid Park Zoo and it looks like the girl really wanted to piss of the caged animal.\n\nWhat happened next drove everyone wild.\n\nFirst, the lion made a fake attack and next, he showed them whos the real boss.\n\nI literally laughed out loud at this. Hopefully the girl learned her lesson. It doesnt always mean that just because an animal is in a glass cage that he couldnt fight back in any way. The lion must be having a bad day!\n\nLions have always been a symbol of strength, power and ferocity, as described in a blog by the WorldWildLife.\n\nHere are some quick facts weve gathered from the site about the king of the jungle:\n\n1. A lion may sleep up to 20 hours a day. 2. A lions heels dont touch the ground when it walks. 3. A good gauge of a male lions age is the darkness of his mane. The darker the mane, the older the lion. 4. Even though the lion is sometimes referred to as the king of the jungle, it actually only lives in grasslands and plains. The expression may have come from an incorrect association between Africa and jungles or may refer to a less literal meaning of the word jungle. 5. A lion can run for short distances at 50 mph and leap as far as 36 feet. 6. A lions roar can be heard from as far as 5 miles away. 7. The lion was once found throughout Africa, Asia and Europe but now exists only in Africa with one exception. The last remaining Asiatic lions are found in Sasan-Gir National Park in India, which was primarily created to protect the species. Currently, there are approximately 350-400 lions in the park. 8. These majestic cats are threatened by habitat loss. The lion is listed as vulnerable on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. 9.

Ive had more opposition to my tattoos than Ive ever had to the chip.

The implants have enabled her to get into her car and to work without carrying keys or a card. She wants to see the chips eventually substitute her wallet and cards.\n\nIn an announcement she made for news.com.au, Shanti said, You could set up your life so you never have to worry about any password or PINs.\n\nIts the same technology as Paypass, so Im hoping youll be able to pay for things with it.\n\nWith Opal, you get a unique identification number that could be programmed into the chip.

Loyalty cards for shops are just another thing for your wallet.\n\nThe microchips, which are about the size of a rice grain, have a great potential  they are similar to a business card and can transfer contact details to smartphones. Plus, they hold complex medical data.\n\nShanti is very positive about the whole procedure. Ive had more opposition to my tattoos than Ive ever had to the chip. My friends are jealous, she says.\n\nShe has established an Australian distribution service called Chip My Life with her husband, Skeeve Stevens, as soon as she recognized the potential and popularity these microchips have.\n\nDepending on the sophistication of the technology, it costs between $80 and $140 to get a microchip implanted, and although it can be done at home, its recommended that the procedure is carried out by doctors who charge $150 for it.\n\nThey do minor surgery, Botox and so on, explains Shanti.

The microchips are barely visible, with the entire procedure leaving a mark as tiny as a freckle.\n\nAlong with Shanti, Amal Graafstra is the American implantable technology pioneer. Amal is the pioneer of the worlds first implant-activated smart gun. Plus, in 2005, he became one of the worlds first RFID implantees, and has even set up an online store which sells at home kits to people who want to upgrade their body. aside from writing a book, Amal has spoken at TEDx and appeared in documentaries.\n\nIn an interview he gave news.com.au, he said, On a psychological level, this is completely different to a smartphone or a Fitbit, because it goes in you.\n\nYour kidneys are working hard but youre not thinking about them, its not something you have to manage.\n\nIts given me the ability to communicate with machines. Its literally integrated into who I am.\n\nBeing conscious of the ethical and security concerns, he emphasizes that the data held within the microchips is encoded. Its just a method of computing in the body.\n\nCurrently he is focused on advocating for the rights of citizens who have already received microchip implants. According to him, the destruction of the chip could be equivalent to an assault, just like with a pacemaker. Another possible danger is that governments could forcefully take out data from the microchips.\n\nI want to make sure its treated as part of the body, like an organ, says Amal.\n\nSo far, microchips have been offered as an alternative to a work pass to employees in a company in Sweden. However, Amal claims that microchips are actually rising in popularity.\n\nAt the moment, its mainly access  house, computer motorcycle. But in the future, theres the potential to use it for transit, payment. You could get rid of your keys and maybe your wallet.\n\nOne thing is for sure  microchips provide a range of uses.

SeeExample(s)\n\nThe prospect of governments forcingcitizens toundergo microchip implants fortracking or other purposes is of perennial concern to the conspiracy-minded, so much so that any mention of chip implants in the news is enough to spark apocalyptic howls.\n\nConsider this August 2016 item out of Australia: Australians Embracing Super-Human Microchip Technology. Its a fluff pieceabout a Sydney biohacking entrepreneur namedShanti Korporaal whose business isarranging for people to get microchip implants if they want them  as in,voluntarily. Theres nothing in the original article about government programs, or mandated chipping, or anything of the kind, yet this is how the same story was reworked for Internet consumption by a web site called Organic & Healthy:\n\nAustralia Becomes First Country To Begin Microchipping Its Public Back in 2010, CBS news reported that the Australian government had a potential RFID microchipping plan in the works related to the health care system. Now, it seems that this plan is beginning to unfold but the push is not a result of mandated health care reforms, but rather a clever propaganda campaign that equates RFID microchipping with becoming superhuman, and people are begging for it. It may sound like sci-fi, but hundreds of Australians are turning themselves into super-humans who can unlock doors, turn on lights and log into computers with a wave of the hand. Shanti Korporaal, from Sydney, is at the centre of the phenomenon after having two implants inserted under her skin. \n\nAgain, theres nothing in the original report,nor any additional information provided in the reworked version, to support the claim that Australia is microchipping its public. To the contrary, all that has been reported is that a fewAustralian techno-hipsters have begun microchippingthemselves on the assumption that this will one day be a useful technology. For that matter, Australia isnt even the first country where self-chipping has taken place; its been going on in the U.S. for years.\n\nAustralia has not begun microchipping its public. The claim that it has is, at best, misinformation and, at worst, a lie.\n\nAnd its also not true that, as claimed in the example at the head of this page, NBC predicted that all Americans will receive a microchip implant in 2017.','2017-03-25 03:51:11'),(37,6,'0769760f5892d6b7a1bcd4149a246c94f10d7dc5a8b6c764cc43b6c79de75d78','125a9ca40e8a4a158fe307c29ba6a20c','','','Shanti Korporaal, from Sydney, is at the centre of the phenomenon after having two implants inserted under her skin.\n\nNow she can get into work and her car without carrying a card or keys, and says her ultimate goal is to completely do away with her wallet and cards.\n\nYou could set up your life so you never have to worry about any password or PINs she told news.com.au.\n\nIts the same technology as Paypass, so Im hoping youll be able to pay for things with it.\n\nWith Opal you get a unique identification number that could be programmed into the chip. Any door with a swipe card ... it could open your computer, photocopier. Loyalty cards for shops are just another thing for your wallet.\n\nThe microchips, which are the size of a grain of rice, can act like a business card and transfer contact details to smartphones, and hold complex medical data.\n\nShanti has had some messages from ultra-conservative Christians on Facebook telling her shes going to hell, but the reaction has mainly been one of intrigue.\n\nMy nana wants one, laughs Shanti. Ive had more opposition to my tattoos than Ive ever had to the chip. My friends are jealous.\n\nWhen the 27-year-old realised just how coveted the implants were, she set up an Australian distribution service called Chip My Life with her husband, Skeeve Stevens.\n\nIt costs between $80 and $140 depending on the sophistication of the technology, and (while you can do it at home) they work with doctors who charge $150 to insert the implant.\n\nThey do minor surgery, Botox and so on, says Shanti. They give you a local, an injection and a quick ultrasound to make sure its in place.\n\nThe biohacking couple both have RFID (radio-frequency identification) chips in their left hands and NFC (near-field communication) chips in the right. The implant is almost impossible to spot, leaving a mark as small as a freckle.\n\nShanti is appearing at todays Sydney launch of cyborg-themed video game Deus Ex Mankind Divided alongside US implantable technology pioneer Amal Graafstra.\n\nAmal considers himself a guinea-pig for human augmentation, making headlines in the US last week with a prototype of the worlds first implant-activated smart gun.\n\nHe became one of the worlds first RFID implantees in 2005, and has since founded an online store to sell the at home kits to people who want to upgrade their body. Hes written a book, spoken at TEDx and appeared in documentaries.\n\nOn a psychological level, this is completely different to a smartphone or a Fitbit, because it goes in you, he told news.com.au.\n\nYour kidneys are working hard but youre not thinking about them, its not something you have to manage.\n\nIts given me the ability to communicate with machines. Its literally integrated into who I am.\n\nHe is aware of the ethical and security concerns, but points out that the data is encrypted, and most of your access cards are not secure anyway. This is simply a case of computing in the body.\n\nRather than worry about people being forced to be microchipped, hes now busy advocating for the rights of citizens who use them.\n\nHe believes the destruction of the chip could in some cases classify as assault (as with a pacemaker) and other dangers might be governments forcibly extracting implants or data from them.\n\nI want to make sure its treated as part of the body, like an organ, he says.\n\nOne firm in Sweden has allowed employees to choose chips over a work pass, with 400 taking up the offer, but Amal says he more often hears from interested individuals who want to try it out.\n\nAt the moment, its mainly access  house, computer motorcycle. But in the future theres the potential to use it for transit, payment. You could get rid of your keys and maybe your wallet.\n\nOther uses might include children tapping to let parents know they are at school safely, refugees checking in at camps or women at shelters.\n\nIt can share diet, exercise and sleep information with you and your doctor, and the next generation could even release medicine as and when you need it.\n\nFor Shanti, adding an extra dimension to life is a childhood fantasy come true.\n\nEver since watching movies like the Terminator, Matrix and Minority Report I wondered if we could actually live like that.

The promotion was so popular, Noble worried that the stampede of customers would break the glass windows of the store front.\n\nA \"brazier,\" by the way, is another word for a charcoal grill.\n\nThe original store was deemed \"Dairy Queen\" because Jack \"Grandpa\" McCullough, the \"driving force\" behind DQs soft serve, said his creation was a queen among dairy products.\n\nAnd just like KFC and Coke, they\'ll never reveal the ingredients. \"[The formula] is kept in a safe deposit box and there are only a few keys to it,\" DQ\'s chief branding officer, Michael Keller, has said.\n\nGwen Stefani and her brother Eric worked with other founding member John Spence at an Anaheim store, where they discussed forming a band.Other celebrity DQ employees include former Attorney General John Ashcroft, actress Bonnie Hunt, and singer Martina McBride.\n\nTheysold more than 175 million Blizzards in the very first year.\n\nIts proof of how thick and delicious their soft-serve isbut its also a total marketing gimmick.

He had trouble perfecting the trademark Q swirl at the top of soft-serve cones.\n\nAccording to the company, \"Our soft-serve does not qualify to be called ice cream. To be categorized as ice cream, the minimum butterfat content must be 10 percent, and our soft-serve has only 5 percent butterfat.\"\n\nThe soft-serve round coated in chocolate and finished with that signature Dairy Queen swirl was introduced to the franchise by Robert Litherland, the co-owner of a store in Moorhead, Minn. Employees of an ice cream distributor in Minneapolis showed up at Litherlands door to demonstrate the technique, and finished by holding up the completed bar and saying, Now, isnt that a dilly! The name stuck, though Litherland had one regret: \"We werent smart enough to copyright that name.\"\n\nWhen DQ rolled out the MooLatte frozen coffee drink in 2004, more than a few eyebrows were raised at the made-up words similarity to the slur \"mulatto.\" The controversy wasnt enough to squash the product; its still around today.\n\nWhen the copyright license expired, Dairy Queen chose not to renew it.

Chong, part of the comedy duo Cheech and Chong, announced earlier this year that his rectal cancer had returned. The cancer is believed to be treatable, but it is now the second time in the last five years that he has battled cancer.\n\nChong announced that he would be undergoing chemotherapy and radiation starting in the summer, and he would also be using marijuana to help ease the side effects of the treatment.\n\nThe chemo and radiation were prescribed by the comedians doctors. The marijuana part was Chongs idea.\n\nI dont tell them I smoke, we dont talk about that. Thats a no-no, Chong said in an interview with ABC News.

Humidity is between 60-100 %.\n\nThere are more 583 languages and dialects spoken in the archipelago. They normally belong to the 350 different ethnic groups of the population. Bahasa Indonesia is the national language, written in Roman script and based on European orthography. In all tourist destination areas English is the number one foreign languages fairly spoken and written.\n\nThe staple food of most of Indonesia is nasi (rice). On some of the island in eastern Indonesia, staple food traditionally ranged from corn, sago, cassava to sweet potatoes. Fish features prominently in the diet as fresh, salted, dried, smoked or a paste. Coconut is found everywhere and besides being produced for cooking oil, its milk - the juice from the white meat - is an ingredient for many dishes. Spices and hot chili Peppers are the essence of most cooking, and in some areas they are used generously such as in West Sumatra and North Sulawesi. Each province or area has its own cuisine, which vary in the method of cooking and ingredients. The Javanese cuisine is probably more palatable to the general taste and consists of vegetables, soybeans, beef, chicken and other varieties.\n\nThe Sumatrans generally eat more beef compared to the other regions. West Sumatra particularly is known for its Padang restaurants found nationwide. Beside the hot and spicy food, these restaurants are known for their unique style of service. Further to the east, seafood features on the daily diet, either grilled or made into curries. In Bali, Papua and the highlands of North Sumatra and North Sulawesi pork dishes are specialties. Pork is usually served in Chinese restaurants or non-moslem regions. There is a wide variety of tropical and sub-tropical fruits and vegetables all year round. Coffee and tea plantations are plentiful, growing on several islands, and served everywhere from fine restaurants to small village stalls. There are several breweries which produce local beer. Bali produces brem which is a rice wine, whereas Toraja has its tuak which is also known in North Sumatra. Most common nationwide are sate (skewered grilled meat), gado-gado (vegetable salad with a peanut sauce), nasi goreng (fried rice served at anytime) and bakmi goreng (fried noodles).\n\nShould I go alone, or on a tour?\n\nIf you are even thinking about this, you should probably go on your own. Most areas visited by package tours go to places that are easily accessible to independent travelers, prices are low, the people friendly, and if you really want to meet other travelers, there are plenty of places to find them. The only two cases where tours can be worth taking are if you either want a simple beach holiday in Bali, in which case a flight + hotel deal can be cheaper than booking them separately, or if you go on some adventure tour to remote parts of Papua or Kalimantan that could be too hard to do on your own, at least if it\'s your first visit to the country.\n\nWhich are the most interesting islands/regions to visit?\n\nThis really depends on your interests! Java and Bali have the most impressive temples and \"high\" art. Sumatra, Sulawesi and Nusa Tenggara have the most impressive traditional village architecture. Java, Sumatra and Kalimantan have the best wildlife. Maluku, Sulawesi and Nusa Tenggara have the best, accessible beaches and coral reefs. Papua, Maluku and Kalimantan receive the fewest visitors. Java and Bali have the best hotels, shopping and nightlife.\n\nWhere are the best dive-spots?\n\nIn general, Indonesia\'s coral reefs get richer the further east you go, with the Raja Ampat Islands having been nominated as the global centre of marine biodiversity. Diving possibilities are somewhat limited by availability of facilities though. So a list of the best places where you can actually dive would include (in alphabetical order only!) Alor in East Nusa Tenggara, Banda in Maluku, Bunaken in North Sulawesi, Labuhanbajo in East Nusa Tenggara, Raja Ampat in Western Papua, Sanglaki in East Kalimantan and Wakatobi in Southeast Sulawesi.\n\nWhere are the best beaches?\n\nWell, this is a tricky one! \n\n Many people, find their own favourite spots they\'d rather keep secret. The pick of these would be the Kei Islands in Maluku, a region which has many other candidates, too. Closer to Jakarta, stunning beaches can be found on and around the island of Belitung. Some of the most unspoilt beaches with stunning reefs just off-shore are in the Raja Ampat Islands in Papua. Sangalaki in East Kalimantan is another remote gem, as are the remote Natuna Islands, curiously located between peninsular Malaysia and Sarawak. None of these has a wealth of places to stay though, so those looking for beaches with more comforts and a livelier travelers scene could check out the Gili Islands and Kuta in Lombok, the Labuhanbajo area of Flores, the Karimunjawa Islands of Central Java, various beaches and islands around North Sulawesi, the Togean Islands of Central Sulawesi... and the list could go on.\n\n Finding your own \"secret\" favorite should not be hard in East Indonesia!\n\nWhat is a decent budget for Indonesia?\n\nAs usual this largely depends on how you travel, where you stay and eat. But in Indonesia, another factor is how widely you travel within this vast country. Trying to cover a lot of ground within the confines of a 30 or 60 day visa would mean having to take a couple of internal flights, adding to the cost. Visiting far-flung Papua, Maluku or Kalimantan would also require a higher daily budget. Basically, at the bottom end of the scale, really budget-conscious backpackers happy to travel by bus between say Sumatra, Java and Bali, eating at cheap warungs (footstalls) and staying in the cheapest accommodation available could get by on as little as US $15-20/day. Couples or friends travelling together might spend a bit less than solo travelers, as they can share the costs of rooms and private transport. Start adding extras like eating at tourist-oriented places, staying at nicer places, going out at night or doing activities like diving, and costs will start increasing steeply. In places like Bali or Java the sky is pretty much the upper limit, though on the other hand in many remote areas you will simply not find much to spend on!\n\nHow long time do I need to see the country?\n\nA lifetime is not enough to \"see it all\" - seriously! But there is no point in trying to see everything on a short trip. Before deciding on where you want to go, do sit down with a map, comparing the size of Indonesia to that of other countries in the region, like Thailand or Vietnam. You will quickly realize that this country is as big as several others put together, and is in fact best treated accordingly. While you could see some \"highlights\" of each of Indonesia\'s main regions in as little as a week (in each), and thus cover the country in 2 months or so by flying all over, a more sensible idea is to pick only one, or at most a few regions, and see them better.\n\nIn my experience, one month is about enough to see all the main attractions of a single region like Sumatra or Sulawesi, with two months allowing you to get off the beaten track in each as well. Add that up, and you could spend a year or more covering just the main attractions of the country easily! If you don\'t have that much time, don\'t worry - but do pick your priorities!\n\nWhat if I visit during Ramadan?\n\nLife still goes on during the month of fasting. You will find that many places to eat stay closed during the day, but others remain open. In any case, you could plan to spend this period in Hindu Bali or in one of Indonesia\'s Christian regions like North Sumatra, North Sulawesi, East Nusa Tenggara, South Maluku or Papua, where there would be even less effect of Ramadan to be felt.\n\nI have heard that flying is unsafe... and so are boats?!?\n\nTo keep things in perspective, remember that Indonesia is made up by thousands of islands, which means that on any given day there will be hundreds or thousands of flights and boats transporting passengers between them. Given those numbers, and the fact that this is still a developing nation after all, it is not all that surprising that the odd disaster strikes every now and then, but realistically, your chances of being the victim of a plane-crash or a ferry-sinking in Indonesia are probably no higher than experiencing a traffic accident elsewhere in the World.\n\nHow easy is it to get around without speaking Indonesian?\n\nDepends on where you go. In touristy areas like Bali\'s resorts, no problem at all. You can also get around pretty easily between the main attractions of every region. Off the beaten track, you can still find some people who speak English in major cities, but would be unlikely to find any out in the villages. Carrying a phrasebook if planning to travel off the beaten track, and starting to learn as many of the key words and phrases as you can as soon as possible. It is easier than you might think!\n\nWith all the news of logging, can I still find beautiful nature?\n\nIndonesia is simply HUGE, with much of it very remote as well. So while logging, both legal and illegal is definitely a problem here (like in much of the tropics), there are still huge areas of pristine nature left. You may have to know where to look to find them, but if you make just a little effort, it is not hard at all. Much of East Indonesia is still very pristine and beautiful by any definition.\n\nWhich are the best places to see wildlife?\n\nNote that the best places to see wildlife are not necessarily the largest and remotest conservation areas in deepest-darkest Borneo or Papua! In fact, most people are surprised to hear that Java\'s national parks are perhaps the country\'s most rewarding in this respect.','2017-03-25 03:51:12'),(83,13,'0c25fa889de0724e1c1ac99f7206af75da46d00868784cbef0f98fb41bf29179','e8560b1460214e5ba0f50916285d87a3','','','The Office of Public Affairs (OPA) is the single point of contact for all inquiries about the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).\n\nWe read every letter, fax, or e-mail we receive, and we will convey your comments to CIA officials outside OPA as appropriate.

Situated between the Indian and Pacific oceans, it is the world\'s largest island country, with more than seventeen thousand islands.[10] At 1,904,569 square kilometres (735,358 square miles), Indonesia is the world\'s 14th-largest country in terms of land area and world\'s 7th-largest country in terms of combined sea and land area.[11] It has an estimated population of over 260 million people and is the world\'s fourth most populous country, the most populous Austronesian nation, as well as the most populous Muslim-majority country.[12] The world\'s most populous island, Java, contains more than half of the country\'s population.\n\nIndonesia\'s republican form of government includes an elected legislature and president. Indonesia has 34 provinces, of which five have Special Administrative status. Its capital and country\'s most populous city is Jakarta, which is also the most populous city in Southeast Asia and the second in Asia.[13][14] The country shares land borders with Papua New Guinea, East Timor, and the eastern part of Malaysia. Other neighbouring countries include Singapore, Vietnam, the Philippines, Australia, Palau, and the Indian territory of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. Despite its large population and densely populated regions, Indonesia has vast areas of wilderness that support the world\'s second highest level of biodiversity. The country has abundant natural resources like oil and natural gas, tin, copper and gold. Agriculture mainly produces rice, palm oil, tea, coffee, cacao, medicinal plants, spices and rubber.[15] Indonesia\'s major trading partners are Japan, United States, China and the surrounding countries of Singapore, Malaysia and Australia.\n\nThe Indonesian archipelago has been an important region for trade since at least the 7th century, when Srivijaya and then later Majapahit traded with China and India. Local rulers gradually absorbed foreign cultural, religious and political models from the early centuries CE, and Hindu and Buddhist kingdoms flourished. Indonesian history has been influenced by foreign powers drawn to its natural resources. Muslim traders and Sufi scholars brought the now-dominant Islam,[16][17] while European powers brought Christianity and fought one another to monopolise trade in the Spice Islands of Maluku during the Age of Discovery. Following three and a half centuries of Dutch colonialism starting from Amboina and Batavia, and eventually all of the archipelago including Timor and Western New Guinea, at times interrupted by Portuguese, French and British rule, Indonesia secured its independence after World War II.\n\nIndonesia consists of hundreds of distinct native ethnic and linguistic groups. The largest  and politically dominant  ethnic group are the Javanese. A shared identity has developed, defined by a national language, ethnic diversity, religious pluralism within a Muslim-majority population, and a history of colonialism and rebellion against it. Indonesia\'s national motto, \"Bhinneka Tunggal Ika\" (\"Unity in Diversity\" literally, \"many, yet one\"), articulates the diversity that shapes the country. Indonesia\'s economy is the world\'s 16th largest by nominal GDP and the 8th largest by GDP at PPP, the largest in Southeast Asia, and is considered an emerging market and newly industrialised country. Indonesia has been a member of the United Nations since 1950.[a] Indonesia was an organizer of the Bandung Conference[18] and was the founder of Non-Aligned Movement; and also the founding member of Association of Southeast Asian Nations, Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, East Asia Summit, and Organisation of Islamic Cooperation. Indonesia is a member of the G20 major economies, OPEC, and World Trade Organization.\n\nThe name Indonesia derives from the Greek name of the Inds () and the word nsos (), meaning \"Indian island\".[19] The name dates to the 18th century, far predating the formation of independent Indonesia.[20] In 1850, George Windsor Earl, an English ethnologist, proposed the terms Indunesiansand, his preference, Malayunesiansfor the inhabitants of the \"Indian Archipelago or Malayan Archipelago\". In the same publication, one of his students, James Richardson Logan, used Indonesia as a synonym for Indian Archipelago.[22] However, Dutch academics writing in East Indies publications were reluctant to use Indonesia; they preferred Malay Archipelago (Maleische Archipel); the Netherlands East Indies (Nederlandsch Oost Indi), popularly Indi; the East (de Oost); and Insulinde.[24]\n\nAfter 1900, Indonesia became more common in academic circles outside the Netherlands, and Indonesian nationalist groups adopted it for political expression.[24] Adolf Bastian, of the University of Berlin, popularised the name through his book Indonesien oder die Inseln des Malayischen Archipels, 18841894. The first Indonesian scholar to use the name was Suwardi Suryaningrat (Ki Hajar Dewantara), when in 1913 he established a press bureau in the Netherlands, Indonesisch Pers-bureau.[20]\n\nFossils and the remains of tools show that the Indonesian archipelago was inhabited by Homo erectus, known as \"Java Man\", between 1.5 million years ago and 35,000 years ago.[25][26][27] Homo sapiens reached the region by around 45,000 years ago.[28] Austronesian peoples, who form the majority of the modern population, migrated to Southeast Asia from Taiwan. They arrived in Indonesia around 2000 BCE, and as they spread through the archipelago, confined the indigenous Melanesian peoples to the far eastern regions.\n\nIdeal agricultural conditions and the mastering of wet-field rice cultivation as early as the 8th century BCE, allowed villages, towns, and small kingdoms to flourish by the 1st century CE. Indonesia\'s strategic sea-lane position fostered inter-island and international trade, including links with Indian kingdoms and China, which were established several centuries BCE. Trade has since fundamentally shaped Indonesian history.\n\nFrom the 7th century CE, the powerful Srivijaya naval kingdom flourished as a result of trade and the influences of Hinduism and Buddhism that were imported with it.[35] Between the eighth and 10th centuries CE, the agricultural Buddhist Sailendra and Hindu Mataram dynasties thrived and declined in inland Java, leaving grand religious monuments such as Borobudur, Sewu and Prambanan. This period marked a renaissance of Hindu-Buddhist art in ancient Java.[36]\n\nAround the first quarter of the 10th century, the centre of the kingdom was shifted from Mataram area in Central Java to Brantas River valley in East Java by Mpu Sindok, who established the Isyana Dynasty.[37]:128 Subsequently, series of Javanese Hindu-Buddhist polities rise and fall, from Kahuripan kingdom ruled by Airlangga to Kadiri and Singhasari. In West Java, Sunda Kingdom was re-established circa 1030 according to Sanghyang Tapak inscription. In Bali, the Warmadewas established their rule on the Kingdom of Bali in the 10th century. The Hindu Majapahit kingdom was founded in eastern Java in the late 13th century, and under Gajah Mada, its influence stretched over much of Indonesia.[38]\n\nAlthough Muslim traders first travelled through Southeast Asia early in the Islamic era, the earliest evidence of Islamised populations in Indonesia dates to the 13th century in northern Sumatra. Other Indonesian areas gradually adopted Islam, and it was the dominant religion in Java and Sumatra by the end of the 16th century. For the most part, Islam overlaid and mixed with existing cultural and religious influences, which shaped the predominant form of Islam in Indonesia, particularly in Java.\n\nThe first regular contact between Europeans and the peoples of Indonesia began in 1512, when Portuguese traders, led by Francisco Serro, sought to monopolise the sources of nutmeg, cloves, and cubeb pepper in Maluku. Dutch and British traders followed. In 1602, the Dutch established the Dutch East India Company (VOC), and in following decades, the Dutch gained foothold in Batavia and Amboina. Throughout 17th and 18th centuries, the company became the dominant European power in the archipelago.[42]\n\nFollowing bankruptcy, the VOC was formally dissolved in 1800, and the government of the Netherlands established the Dutch East Indies as a nationalised colony. For most of the colonial period, Dutch control over the archipelago was tenuous outside of coastal strongholds; only in the early 20th century did Dutch dominance extend to what was to become Indonesia\'s current boundaries.[44] Despite major internal political, social and sectarian divisions during the National Revolution, Indonesians, on the whole, found unity in their fight for independence. Japanese occupation during World War II ended Dutch rule,[45] and encouraged the previously suppressed Indonesian independence movement.[46]\n\nA UN report stated that four million people died in Indonesia as a result of famine and forced labour during the Japanese occupation.[47] Two days after the surrender of Japan in August 1945, Sukarno, an influential nationalist leader, declared independence and was appointed president.[48][49][50][incomplete short citation] The Netherlands tried to reestablish their rule, and an armed and diplomatic struggle ended in December 1949, when in the face of international pressure, the Dutch formally recognised Indonesian independence[49][52] (with the exception of the Dutch territory of West New Guinea, which was incorporated into Indonesia following the 1962 New York Agreement, and the UN-mandated Act of Free Choice of 1969).[53]\n\nSukarno moved Indonesia from democracy towards authoritarianism, and maintained his power base by balancing the opposing forces of the military and the Communist Party of Indonesia (Partai Komunis Indonesia, PKI). An attempted coup on 30 September 1965 was countered by the army, which led a violent anti-communist purge, during which the PKI was blamed for the coup and effectively destroyed.[56] Large-scale killings took place which targeted communists, ethnic Chinese and alleged leftists. The most widely accepted estimates are that between 500,000 and one million people were killed, with some estimates as high as two to three million.[58][59][60]\n\nThe head of the military, General Suharto, outmaneuvered the politically weakened Sukarno and was formally appointed president in March 1968. His New Order administration[61] was supported by the US government,[62][64] and encouraged foreign direct investment in Indonesia, which was a major factor in the subsequent three decades of substantial economic growth. However, the authoritarian \"New Order\" was widely accused of corruption and suppression of political opposition.\n\nIndonesia was the country hardest hit by the late 1990s Asian financial crisis.[68] This increased popular discontent with the New Order and led to popular protest across the country. Suharto resigned on 21 May 1998.[69] In 1999, East Timor voted to secede from Indonesia, after a twenty-five-year military occupation that was marked by international condemnation of repression of the East Timorese.[70]\n\nSince Suharto\'s resignation, a strengthening of democratic processes has included a regional autonomy program, and the first direct presidential election in 2004, which was won by Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, who went on to win a second term in 2009. Political and economic instability, social unrest, corruption, and terrorism slowed progress; however, in the last five years the economy has performed strongly. Although relations among different religious and ethnic groups are largely harmonious, sectarian discontent and violence have persisted.[71] A political settlement to an armed separatist conflict in Aceh was achieved in 2005.[72]\n\nIndonesia lies between latitudes 11S and 6N, and longitudes 95E and 141E. It is the largest archipelagic country in the world, extending 5,120 kilometres (3,181mi) from east to west and 1,760 kilometres (1,094mi) from north to south. According to a geospatial survey conducted between 2007 and 2010 by National Coordinating Agency for Survey and Mapping (Bakosurtanal), Indonesia has 13,466 islands,[74] about 6,000 of which are inhabited.[10] These are scattered over both sides of the equator. The largest are Java, Sumatra, Borneo (shared with Brunei and Malaysia), New Guinea (shared with Papua New Guinea), and Sulawesi. Indonesia shares land borders with Malaysia on Borneo, Papua New Guinea on the island of New Guinea, and East Timor on the island of Timor. Indonesia shares maritime borders across narrow straits with Singapore, Malaysia, Vietnam, the Philippines, and Palau to the north, and with Australia to the south. The capital, Jakarta, is on Java and is the nation\'s largest city, followed by Surabaya, Bandung, Medan, and Semarang.\n\nIndonesia average population density is 134people per square kilometre (347per sqmi), 79th in the world,[76] although Java, the world\'s most populous island,[77] has a population density of 940people per square kilometre (2,435per sqmi).\n\nAt 4,884 metres (16,024ft), Puncak Jaya in Papua is Indonesia\'s highest peak, and Lake Toba in Sumatra its largest lake, with an area of 1,145 km2 (442sq mi). Indonesia\'s largest rivers are in Kalimantan, and include the Mahakam and Barito; such rivers are communication and transport links between the island\'s river settlements.[79]\n\nIndonesia\'s location on the edges of the Pacific, Eurasian, and Australian tectonic plates makes it the site of numerous volcanoes and frequent earthquakes. Indonesia has at least 150 active volcanoes,[80] including Krakatoa and Tambora, both famous for their devastating eruptions in the 19th century. The eruption of the Toba supervolcano, approximately 70,000 years ago, was one of the largest eruptions ever, and a global catastrophe. Recent disasters due to seismic activity include the 2004 tsunami that killed an estimated 167,736 in northern Sumatra,[81] and the Yogyakarta earthquake in 2006. However, volcanic ash is a major contributor to the high agricultural fertility that has historically sustained the high population densities of Java and Bali.[82]\n\nLying along the equator, Indonesia\'s climate tends to be relatively even year-round.[83] Indonesia has two seasonsa wet season and a dry seasonwith no extremes of summer or winter.[84] For most of Indonesia, the dry season falls between April and October with the wet season between November and March.[84] Indonesia\'s climate is almost entirely tropical, dominated by the Tropical rainforest climate found in every major island of Indonesia, followed by the Tropical monsoon climate that predominantly lies along Java\'s coastal north, Sulawesi\'s coastal south and east, and Bali, and finally the tropical Savanna climate, found in isolated locations of Central Java, lowland East Java, coastal southern Papua and smaller islands to the east of Lombok. However, cooler climate types do exist in mountainous regions of Indonesia 1,300 to 1,500 metres (4,300 to 4,900 feet) above sea level. The oceanic climate (Kppen Cfb) prevail in highland areas with fairly uniform precipitation year-round, adjacent to rainforest climates, while the subtropical highland climate (Kppen Cwb) exist in highland areas with a more pronounced dry season, adjacent to tropical monsoon and savanna climates.\n\nSome regions, such as Kalimantan and Sumatra, experience only slight differences in rainfall and temperature between the seasons, whereas others, such as Nusa Tenggara, experience far more pronounced differences with droughts in the dry season, and floods in the wet. Rainfall in Indonesia is plentiful, particularly in West Sumatra, West Kalimantan, West Java, and Papua. Parts of Sulawesi and some islands closer to Australia, such as Sumba is drier. The almost uniformly warm waters that make up 81% of Indonesia\'s area ensure that temperatures on land remain fairly constant. The coastal plains averaging 28C (82.4F), the inland and mountain areas averaging 26C (78.8F), and the higher mountain regions, 23C (73.4F). The area\'s relative humidity ranges between 70 and 90%.\n\nWinds are moderate and generally predictable, with monsoons usually blowing in from the south and east in June through October and from the northwest in November through March. Typhoons and large scale storms pose little hazard to mariners in Indonesia waters; the major danger comes from swift currents in channels, such as the Lombok and Sape straits.\n\nTectonically, Indonesia is highly unstable. It lies on the Pacific Ring of Fire where the Indo-Australian Plate and the Pacific Plate are pushed under the Eurasian plate where they melt at about 100 kilometres (62 miles) deep. A string of volcanoes stretches from Sumatra to the Banda Sea. While the volcanic ash has resulted in fertile soils, it makes agricultural conditions unpredictable in some areas.[86] The string of volcanoes runs through Sumatra, Java, Bali and Nusa Tenggara, and then to the Banda Islands of Maluku to northeastern Sulawesi. Of the 400 volcanoes, approximately 150 are active.[87]\n\nThe most massive supervolcano eruption was the Toba eruption that took place at the present location of Lake Toba, about 701223668200000000075000years Before Present.[88][incomplete short citation] The supervolcano eruption is believed to have caused volcanic winter and cooling of the climate, and subsequently led to a genetic bottleneck in human evolution about 50,000 years ago.[89][incomplete short citation]\n\nBetween 1972 and 1991, 29 volcanic eruptions were recorded, mostly on Java. The two most violent volcanic eruptions in modern times occurred in Indonesia; in 1815 Mount Tambora in Sumbawa erupted killing 92,000 people.[90] Tambora produced the largest eruption known on the planet during the past 10,000 years.[90] Also the eruption created an umbrella of volcanic ash which spread and blanketed Southeast Asia, plunging it into darkness for a week, and made a whole world without a summer in 1815.[90] The 1883 eruption of Krakatoa was one of the deadliest and most destructive volcanic events in recorded history. Nearly 40,000 deaths are attributed to the eruption itself and the tsunamis it created. Significant additional effects were also felt around the world in the days and weeks after the volcano\'s destruction.[91]\n\nIndonesia\'s size, tropical climate, and archipelagic geography, support the world\'s second highest level of biodiversity after Brazil.[92] Its flora and fauna is a mixture of Asian and Australasian species.[93] The islands of the Sunda Shelf (Sumatra, Java, Borneo, and Bali) were once linked to the Asian mainland, and have a wealth of Asian fauna. Large species such as the tiger, rhinoceros, orangutan, elephant, and leopard, were once abundant as far east as Bali, but numbers and distribution have dwindled drastically. Forests cover approximately 60% of the country.[94] In Sumatra and Kalimantan, these are predominantly of Asian species. However, the forests of the smaller, and more densely populated Java, have largely been removed for human habitation and agriculture. Sulawesi, Nusa Tenggara, and Maluku  having been long separated from the continental landmasseshave developed their own unique flora and fauna.[95] Papua was part of the Australian landmass, and is home to a unique fauna and flora closely related to that of Australia, including over 600 bird species.[96]\n\nIndonesia is second only to Australia in terms of total endemic species, with 36% of its 1,531 species of bird and 39% of its 515 species of mammal being endemic.[97] Indonesia\'s 80,000 kilometres (50,000 miles) of coastline are surrounded by tropical seas that contribute to the country\'s high level of biodiversity. Indonesia has a range of sea and coastal ecosystems, including beaches, sand dunes, estuaries, mangroves, coral reefs, seagrass beds, coastal mudflats, tidal flats, algal beds, and small island ecosystems.[19] Indonesia is one of Coral Triangle countries with the world\'s greatest diversity of coral reef fish with more than 1,650 species in eastern Indonesia only.[98]\n\nThe British naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace described a dividing line between the distribution of Indonesia\'s Asian and Australasian species.[99] Known as the Wallace Line, it runs roughly northsouth along the edge of the Sunda Shelf, between Kalimantan and Sulawesi, and along the deep Lombok Strait, between Lombok and Bali. West of the line the flora and fauna are more Asian  moving east from Lombok they are increasingly Australian. In his 1869 book, The Malay Archipelago, Wallace described numerous species unique to the area.[100] The region of islands between his line and New Guinea is now termed Wallacea.[99]\n\nIndonesia\'s high population and rapid industrialisation present serious environmental issues, which are often given a lower priority due to high poverty levels and weak, under-resourced governance.[101] Issues include large-scale deforestation (much of it illegal) and related wildfires causing heavy smog over parts of western Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore; over-exploitation of marine resources; and environmental problems associated with rapid urbanisation and economic development, including air pollution, traffic congestion, garbage management, and reliable water and waste water services.[101]\n\nDeforestation and the destruction of peatlands make Indonesia the world\'s third largest emitter of greenhouse gases.[102] Habitat destruction threatens the survival of indigenous and endemic species, including 140 species of mammals identified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) as threatened, and 15 identified as critically endangered, including the Bali starling,[103] Sumatran orangutan,[104] and Javan rhinoceros.[105]\n\nMuch of Indonesia\'s deforestation is caused by forest clearing for the palm oil industry, which has cleared 18 million hectares of forest for palm oil expansion. Palm oil expansion requires land reallocation as well as changes to the local and natural ecosystems. Palm oil expansion can generate wealth for local communities, but it can also degrade ecosystems and cause social problems.[106]\n\nIndonesia has a below average but slightly improving performance in the global Environmental Performance Index (EPI) with an overall ranking of 107 out of 180 countries in 2016. This is also below average in the Asia Pacific region, behind Thailand but slightly ahead of China.[107]\n\nIndonesia is a republic with a presidential system. As a unitary state, power is concentrated in the central government. Following the resignation of President Suharto in 1998, Indonesian political and governmental structures have undergone major reforms. Four amendments to the 1945 Constitution of Indonesia[b] have revamped the executive, judicial, and legislative branches.[108]\n\nThe president of Indonesia is the head of state and head of government, commander-in-chief of Tentara Nasional Indonesia (Indonesian National Armed Forces), and the director of domestic governance, policy-making, and foreign affairs. The president appoints a council of ministers, who are not required to be elected members of the legislature. The 2004 presidential election was the first in which the people directly elected the president and vice-president.[109] The president may serve a maximum of two consecutive five-year terms.[110]\n\nThe highest representative body at national level is Majelis Permusyawaratan Rakyat (People\'s Consultative Assembly) or MPR. Its main functions are supporting and amending the constitution, inaugurating the president, and formalising broad outlines of state policy. It has the power to impeach the president.[111] The MPR comprises two houses; Dewan Perwakilan Rakyat (People\'s Representative Council) or DPR, with 560 members, and Dewan Perwakilan Daerah (Regional Representative Council) or DPD, with 132 members.[112] The DPR passes legislation and monitors the executive branch; party-aligned members are elected for five-year terms by proportional representation.[108] Reforms since 1998 have markedly increased the DPR\'s role in national governance.[c] The DPD is a new chamber for matters of regional management.[113]\n\nMost civil disputes appear before Pengadilan Negeri (State Court); appeals are heard before Pengadilan Tinggi (High Court). Mahkamah Agung is the country\'s highest court, and hears final cessation appeals and conducts case reviews. Other courts include the Commercial Court, which handles bankruptcy and insolvency; Pengadilan Tata Negara (State Administrative Court) to hear administrative law cases against the government; Mahkamah Konstitusi (Constitutional Court) to hear disputes concerning legality of law, general elections, dissolution of political parties, and the scope of authority of state institutions; and Pengadilan Agama (Religious Court) to deal with codified Sharia Law cases.[114]\n\nSince 1999 Indonesia has had a multi-party system. In the two legislative elections since the fall of the New Order regime, no political party has managed to win an overall majority of seats, resulting in coalition governments. The Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (Partai Demokrasi Indonesia Perjuangan) is the party of Joko Widodo, the Indonesian President.[115] The Great Indonesia Movement Party (Partai Gerakan Indonesia Raya) is the third largest political party.[116] Other notable parties such as Party of the Functional Groups (Golongan Karya), Democratic Party (Partai Demokrat), and National Awakening Party (Partai Kebangkitan Bangsa).\n\nIndonesia\'s first general election elected members of the People\'s Representative Council (Dewan Perwakilan Rakyat, DPR) and the Constitutional Assembly of Indonesia (Konstituante) was in 1955. At a national level, Indonesian people did not elect a head of state the president  until 2004. Since then, the president is elected for a five-year term, as are the 560-member People\'s Representative Council (Dewan Perwakilan Rakyat, DPR) and the 128-seat Regional Representative Council (Dewan Perwakilan Daerah).[117] Starting from the 2015 unified local elections, Indonesia start to elect governors and mayors simultaneously on the same date.\n\nAdministratively, Indonesia consists of 34 provinces, five of which have special status. Each province has its own legislature and governor. The provinces are subdivided into regencies (kabupaten) and cities (kota), which are further subdivided into districts (kecamatan or distrik in Papua and West Papua), and again into administrative villages (either desa, kelurahan, kampung, nagari in West Sumatra, or gampong in Aceh).\n\nThe village is the lowest level of government administration in Indonesia. Furthermore, a village is divided into several community groups (rukun warga (RW)) which are further divided into neighbourhood groups (rukun tetangga (RT)). In Java the desa (village) is divided further into smaller units called dusun or dukuh (hamlets), these units are the same as rukun warga. Following the implementation of regional autonomy measures in 2001, the regencies and cities have become the key administrative units, responsible for providing most government services. The village administration level is the most influential on a citizen\'s daily life and handles matters of a village or neighbourhood through an elected lurah or kepala desa (village chief).\n\nThe provinces of Aceh, Jakarta, Yogyakarta, Papua, and West Papua have greater legislative privileges and a higher degree of autonomy from the central government than the other provinces. The Acehnese government, for example, has the right to create certain elements of an independent legal system. In 2003, it instituted a form of sharia (Islamic law).[118]\n\nYogyakarta was granted the status of Special Region in recognition of its pivotal role in supporting Indonesian Republicans during the Indonesian Revolution and its willingness to join Indonesia as a republic.[119] Papua, formerly known as Irian Jaya, was granted special autonomy status in 2001 and was split into Papua and West Papua in February 2003.[120][121] Jakarta is the country\'s special capital region.\n\nIndonesian name is in parentheses if different from English.\n\n * indicates provinces with special status\n\nSince independence, Indonesian foreign relations have adhered to a \"free and active\" foreign policy, seeking to play a role in regional affairs commensurate with its size and location but avoiding involvement in conflicts among other countries.[122] In contrast to Sukarno\'s anti-imperialistic antipathy to Western powers and tensions with Malaysia, Indonesia\'s foreign relations since the New Order era have been based on economic and political co-operation with the Western world.[123] Indonesia maintains close relationships with its neighbours in Asia, and is a founding member of ASEAN and the East Asia Summit.[112] The country restored relations with the People\'s Republic of China in 1990 following a freeze in place since anti-communist purges early in the Suharto era.[114] Indonesia also developed a close relationship with the Soviet Union in the period of 19611965.[124]\n\nIndonesia has been a member of the United Nations since 1950,[a] and was a founder of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) and the Organisation of the Islamic Conference (OIC).[112] Indonesia is signatory to the ASEAN Free Trade Area agreement, the Cairns Group, and the World Trade Organization (WTO), and an occasional member of OPEC. Indonesia has received humanitarian and development aid since 1966, in particular from the United States, western Europe, Australia, and Japan.[112]\n\nThe Indonesian government has worked with other countries to apprehend and prosecute perpetrators of major bombings linked to militant Islamism and Al-Qaeda.[125] The deadliest bombing killed 202 people (including 164 international tourists) in the Bali resort town of Kuta in 2002.[126] The attacks, and subsequent travel warnings issued by other countries, severely damaged Indonesia\'s tourism industry and foreign investment prospects.[127]\n\nIndonesia\'s Armed Forces (TNI) include the Army (TNIAD), Navy (TNIAL, which includes Marine Corps), and Air Force (TNIAU).[128] The army has about 400,000 active-duty personnel. Defense spending in the national budget was 4% of GDP in 2006, and is controversially supplemented by revenue from military commercial interests and foundations.[129]\n\nThe Indonesian Armed Forces was formed during the Indonesian National Revolution, when it undertook a guerrilla warfare along with informal militia. As a result of this, and the need to maintain internal security, the Armed forces including the Army, Navy, and Air Force has been organised along territorial lines, aimed at defeating internal enemies of the state and potential external invaders.[130] From the 1950s to 1960s, the country struggled to maintain its unity against local insurgencies and separatist movements in some of its provinces.[131] Separatist movements in the provinces of Aceh and Papua have led to armed conflict, and subsequent allegations of human rights abuses and brutality from all sides.[133] Following a sporadic thirty-year guerrilla war between the Free Aceh Movement (GAM) and the Indonesian military, a ceasefire agreement was reached in 2005.[134] From 1961 to 1963, the TNI was involved in the military campaign to incorporate Western New Guinea into Indonesia, which pitted the TNI against Netherlands New Guinea. From 1962 to 1965, the TNI fought in a confrontation against Malaysia. The armed forces under Suharto was directly involved in the mass killings fighting against the Communist Party of Indonesia in 1965. One of the reforms following the 1998 resignation of Suharto was the removal of formal TNI representation in parliament; nevertheless, its political influence remains extensive. There has been a significant, albeit imperfect, implementation of regional autonomy laws, and a reported decline in the levels of violence and human rights abuses, since the presidency of Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono in Papua.[136]\n\nIndonesia has a mixed economy in which both the private sector and government play significant roles.[137] The country is the largest economy in Southeast Asia and a member of the G20 major economies.[138] Indonesia\'s estimated gross domestic product (nominal), as of 2016 , is US$936.955 billion while GDP in PPP terms is US$$3.010 trillion. It is the sixteenth largest economy in the world by nominal GDP and is the eighth largest in terms of GDP (PPP). As of 2016 , per capita GDP in PPP is US$11,633 (international dollars) while Nominal per capita GDP is US$3,620.[6]\n\nThe debt ratio to GDP is 26%.[139][140][141] The services is the economy\'s largest and accounts for 43.3% of GDP (2016), this is followed by manufacturing sector (42.9%) and agriculture (13.7%).[142] Since 2012, the service sector has employed more people than other sectors. In 2014 accounting for 44.8% of the total labour force was employed on service sector, this has been followed by agriculture (34.3%) and industry (20.9%).[143] Agriculture, however, had been the country\'s largest employer for centuries.[144][145]\n\nOver time, the structure of the Indonesian economy has changed considerably.[146] Historically, the economy has been heavily weighted towards the agricultural sector, reflecting both its stage of economic development and government policies in the 1950s and 1960s to promote agricultural self-sufficiency.[146] A gradual process of industrialisation and urbanisation began in the late 1960s, and accelerated in the 1980s as falling oil prices saw the government focus on diversifying away from oil exports and towards manufactured exports.[146] This development continued throughout the 1980s and into the 1990s despite the oil counter-shocks. During these periods, GDP level rose at an average rate of 7.1%. Indonesia saw consistent growth, with the official poverty rate falling from 60% to 15%.[147] From the mid 1980s, trade barriers were reduced and the Indonesian economy became more globally integrated. The Asian financial crisis that began to affect Indonesia in mid-1997 became an economic and political crisis. Indonesia\'s initial response was to float the rupiah, raise key domestic interest rates, and tighten fiscal policy. The effects of the financial and economic crisis were severe. By November 1997, rapid currency depreciation had seen public debt reach US$60 bn, imposing severe strains on the government\'s budget.[148] In 1998, real GDP contracted by 13.1%. The economy reached its low point in mid-1999 and real GDP growth for the year was 0.8%. Inflation reached 72% in 1998 but slowed to 2% in 1999.\n\nIndonesia\'s recent strong economic growth has also been accompanied by relatively steady inflation.[149] Since an inflation target was introduced in Indonesia in 2000, the GDP deflator and the CPI have grown at an average annual pace of 10 per cent and 9 per cent, respectively, similar to the pace recorded in the two decades prior to the Asian crisis, but well below the pace in the 1960s and 1970s.[150] Inflation has also generally trended lower through the 2000s, with some of the fluctuations in inflation reflecting government policy initiatives such as the changes in fiscal subsidies in 2005 and 2008 which caused large temporary spikes in CPI growth.[149] Since 2007, however, with the improvement in banking sector and domestic consumption, national economic growth has accelerated to over 6% annually[151][152][153] and this helped Indonesia weather the 20082009 Great Recession.[154] The Indonesian economy performed strongly during the financial crisis of 200708 and in 2012, its GDP grew by over 6%.[155] Indonesia regained its investment grade rating in late 2011 after losing it in 1997.[156] As of 2014 , 11% of the population lived below the poverty line and the official open unemployment rate was 5.9%.[157]\n\nIndonesia was the 25th biggest exporting country in the world in 2014, moving up fifth places from the previous five years.[158] In the 20092014 period, the exports of Indonesia have increased at an annualised rate of 7.3%, from US$138 billion in 2009 to US$197 billion in 2014. The most recent exports are led by coal briquettes which represent 10.1% of the total exports, followed by palm oil (8.85%), petroleum gas (8.63%), crude petroleum (4.92%) and rubber (2.75%). Indonesia\'s main export markets (2014) are Japan (12.64%), China (10.56%), the United States (9.54%), Singapore (9.49%) and India (6.9%). The major suppliers of imports to Indonesia are China (18.26%), Singapore (14.38%), Japan (8.65%), South Korea (6.52%) and Malaysia (5.96%). In 2014, Indonesia ran a trade surplus with export revenues of US$197 billion and import expenditure of US$178 billion.[158]\n\nIndonesia has extensive natural resources, including crude oil, natural gas, tin, copper, and gold. Indonesia\'s major imports include machinery and equipment, chemicals, fuels, and foodstuffs, and the country\'s major export commodities include oil and gas, electrical appliances, plywood, rubber, and textiles.[10] In an attempt to boost the domestic mineral processing industry and encourage exports of higher value-added mineral products, the Indonesian government implemented a ban on exports of unprocessed mineral ores in 2014.[159]\n\nPalm oil production is important to the economy of Indonesia as the country is the world\'s biggest producer and consumer of the commodity, providing about half the world supply.[160] Oil palm plantations stretch across 6 million hectares (roughly twice the size of Belgium). Indonesia plans by 2015 to add 4 million additional hectares towards oil palm biofuel production.[161] As of 2012 , Indonesia produces 35 percent of the world\'s certified sustainable palm oil (CSPO).[162]\n\nThe tourism sector contributes to around US$10.1 billion of foreign exchange in 2013, and ranked as the 4th largest among goods and services export sectors.[163] Singapore, Malaysia, Australia, China and Japan are the top five source of visitors to Indonesia.\n\nIndonesia has a sizeable automotive industry, which produced almost 1.3 million motor vehicles in 2014, ranking as the 15th largest producer in the world.[164] Nowadays, Indonesian automotive companies are able to produce cars with high ratio of local content (80%  90%).[165] With production peaking at 14.5 billion packs in 2011, Indonesia is the second largest producer of instant noodle after China which produces 42.5 billion packs a year.[166] Indofood is the largest instant noodle producer in the world. Indomie brand by Indofood is one of the Indonesia\'s best known global brand.[167]\n\nOf the world\'s 500 largest companies measured by revenue in 2014, the Fortune Global 500, two are headquartered in Indonesia i.e. Pertamina and Perusahaan Listrik Negara.[168]\n\nIn 2014 Indonesia imported $178B, making it the 27th largest importer in the world.[158] During the last five years the imports of Indonesia have increased at an annualised rate of 12.5%, from $98.7B in 2009 to $178B in 2014. The most recent imports are led by Refined Petroleum which represent 14.6% of the total imports of Indonesia, followed by Crude Petroleum, which account for 6.78%. The top import origins of Indonesia are China, Singapore, Japan, South Korea and Malaysia.\n\nThe road transport system is predominant, with a total length of 437,759 kilometres (272,011 miles) as of 2008 . Many cities and towns have some form of transportation for hire available as well such as taxis. There are usually bus services such as the Kopaja buses and the more sophisticated TransJakarta bus rapid transit system in Jakarta. The TransJakarta is the largest and longest bus rapid transit system in the world, boasts some 210.31 kilometres (130.68 miles) and carriers more than 300,000 passengers daily.[169] In addition, BRT systems exist in Yogyakarta, Palembang, Bandung, Denpasar, Pekanbaru, Semarang, Makassar, and Padang without segregated lane. Many cities have motorised auto rickshaws (bajaj). Cycle rickshaws, called becak in Indonesia, are a regular sight on city roads and provide inexpensive transportation.\n\nThe rail transport system has four unconnected networks in Java and Sumatra primarily dedicated to transport bulk commodities and long-distance passenger traffic. The inter-city rail network on Java is complemented by local commuter rail services in the Jakarta metropolitan area (KA Commuter Jabodetabek), Surabaya, Medan, and Bandung. In Jakarta, suburban rail services carry 700,000 passengers a day.[170] In addition, mass rapid transit and light rail transit systems are under construction in Jakarta.[171][172] and Palembang.[173] The government\'s plan to build a High-Speed Rail was announced by Indonesian Government in July 2015.[174] Indonesia\'s and Southeast Asia\'s first high-speed rail project was expected to connect the national capital Jakarta with Bandung in neighbouring West Java province, covering a distance of around 140 kilometres (87 miles). Plans were mentioned for a possible extension of the HSR to Indonesia\'s second largest city, Surabaya in East Java; construction will begin in early 2017.[175]\n\nSea transport is extremely important for economic integration and for domestic and foreign trade. It is well developed, with each of the major islands having at least one significant port city. Because Indonesia encompasses a sprawling archipelago, maritime shipping provides essential links between parts of the country. Boats in common use include large container ships, a variety of ferries, passenger ships, sailing ships, and smaller motorised vessels. Traditional wooden vessel pinisi are widely used as the inter-island freight service in Indonesian archipelago.\n\nPort of Tanjung Priok is Indonesia\'s busiest port, and the 21st busiest port in the world in 2013, handling over 6.59 million TEUs.[176] To boost port capacity, a two-phase \"New Tanjung Priok\" extension project is ongoing. When fully operational in 2023, it will triple existing annual capacity. In 2015 ground breaking of North Sumatra\'s Kuala Tanjung Port has been done. The port is an extremely strategic development that can accommodate 400.000 TEUs (twenty-foot equivalent units) per year,[177] overtaking Johor\'s Tanjung Pelepas Port and could even compete with Singapore\'s port.[178]\n\nFrequent ferry services cross the straits between nearby islands, especially in the chain of islands stretching from Sumatra through Java to the Lesser Sunda Islands. On the busy crossings between Sumatra, Java, and Bali, car ferries run frequently 24 hours per day. There are international ferry services between across the Strait of Malacca between Sumatra and Malaysia, and between Singapore and nearby Indonesian islands, such as Batam. A network of passenger ships makes longer connections to more remote islands, especially in the eastern part of the archipelago. The national shipping line, Pelni, provides passenger service to ports throughout the country on a two- to four-week schedule. These ships generally provide the least expensive way to cover long distances between islands. Smaller privately run boats provide service between islands.\n\nAs of 2014 , there were 237 airports in Indonesia,[182] including 17 international airports. SoekarnoHatta International Airport is the 18th busiest airport in the world, serving 54,053,905 passengers, according to Airports Council International.[183] Today the airport is running over capacity. After T3 Soekarno-Hatta Airport expansion was finished in August 2016, the total capacity of three terminals become 43 million passengers a year. T1 and T2 will be revitalised, so all the terminals finally will accommodate 67 million passengers a year.[184] When finished, Soekarno-Hatta airport will be an aerotropolis.[185] Juanda Airport in Surabaya and Ngurah Rai in Bali are the country\'s 2nd and 3rd busiest airport.[186]\n\nGaruda Indonesia, flag carrier of Indonesia since 1949, was selected by Skytrax as \"The World\'s Best Economy Class\" in 2013. In December 2014, Garuda Indonesia was awarded as a \"5-Star Airline\" by Skytrax and the eight best airlines in the world.[187][188][189] In 2016, it was awarded number one as \"The World\'s Best Cabin Crew\".[179]\n\nAccording to IEA Indonesia was the 10th top natural gas producer in 2009: 76 billion cubics (bcm) 2.5% of world production of which 36 bcm was exported.[190] In 2009 Indonesia was the 5th top coal producer: 263 million tonnes hard coal and 38 million tonnes brown.[190] The majority of this, 230 Mt of hard coal, was exported.[191] Indonesia has significant energy resources, starting with oil  it has 22 billion barrels of conventional oil and gas reserves, of which about 4 billion are recoverable. That\'s the equivalent of about10 years of oil production and 50 years of gas. It has about 8 billion barrels of oil-equivalent of coal-based methane (CBM) resources. It has 28 billion tonnes of recoverable coal. It has 28 gigawatts (GW) of geothermal potential. 1 Includes recoverable resources of oil and gas yet to be discovered. It has even more in the form of solar, wind, biomass and biofuel potential. Indonesia\'s domestic oil consumption has grown from 1.2 million barrels per day in 2003 to 1.6 million barrels per day in 2013.[190]\n\nJatiluhur Dam, the country\'s largest dam which serves several purposes including the provision of hydroelectric power generation, water supply, flood control, irrigation and aquaculture. The power station has an installed capacity of 186.5 MW which feeds into the Java grid managed by the state-owned electricity company Perusahaan Listrik Negara. The Jatiluhur reservoir helps irrigate 240,000ha (593,053 acres) of rice fields. The earth-fill dam is 105m (344ft) high and withholds a reservoir of 3,000,000,000m3 (2,432,140acreft).[192][193][194]\n\nAccording to the 2010 national census, the population of Indonesia is 237.6 million, with high population growth at 1.9%.[195] 58% of the population lives in Java,[196] the world\'s most populous island.[77] In 1961, the first post-colonial census gave a total population of 97 million.[197]\n\nIndonesia currently possess a relatively young population, with a median age of 28.2 years (2011 estimate).[198]\n\nThe population is expected to grow to around 269 million by 2020 and 321 million by 2050.[199] An additional 8 million Indonesian live overseas, comprising one of the world\'s largest diasporas. Most of them settled in Malaysia, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, South Korea, Japan, Singapore, Netherlands, United States, and Australia.[200]\n\nIndonesia is a very ethnically and linguistically diverse country, with around 300 distinct native ethnic groups, and 742 different languages and dialects.[201][202] Most Indonesians are descended from Austronesian-speaking peoples whose languages can be traced to Proto-Austronesian, which possibly originated in Taiwan. Another major grouping are the Melanesians, who inhabit eastern Indonesia.[203]\n\nThe largest ethnic group are the Javanese, who comprise 42% of the population, and are politically and culturally dominant.[204] The Sundanese, ethnic Malays, and Madurese are the largest non-Javanese groups. A sense of Indonesian nationhood exists alongside strong regional identities.\n\nSocial, religious and ethnic tensions have triggered communal violence.[207][208][209] Chinese Indonesians are an influential ethnic minority comprising 34% of the population.[210] Much of the country\'s privately owned commerce and wealth is Chinese-Indonesian-controlled. Chinese businesses in Indonesia are part of the larger bamboo network, a network of overseas Chinese businesses operating in the markets of Southeast Asia that share common family and cultural ties.[213] This has contributed to considerable resentment, and even anti-Chinese violence.[214][215][216]\n\nMore than 700 regional languages are spoken in Indonesia\'s numerous islands.[217] Some belong to the Austronesian language family, while many Papuan languages are spoken in Western New Guinea. The official language is Indonesian (also known as Bahasa Indonesia) a variant of Malay,[218] which was used in the archipelago. It borrows heavily from local languages such as Javanese, Sundanese, Minangkabau, etc. Indonesian is primarily used in commerce, administration, education and the media, but most Indonesians speak other languages, such as Javanese, as their first language.[217]\n\nIndonesian is based on the prestige dialect of Malay, that of the Johor-Riau Sultanate, which for centuries had been the lingua franca of the archipelago. It is the official language of Singapore, Malaysia and Brunei. Indonesian is universally taught in schools and consequently is spoken by nearly every Indonesian. It is the language of business, politics, national media, education, and academia.\n\nIndonesian was promoted by Indonesian nationalists in the 1920s, and declared the official language under the name Bahasa Indonesia in the proclamation of independence in 1945. Most Indonesians speak at least one of several hundred local languages and dialects, often as their first language. In comparison, Papua has over 270 indigenous Papuan and Austronesian languages,[219] in a region of about 2.7 million people. Javanese is the most widely spoken local language, as it is the language of the largest ethnic group.[10]\n\nWhile religious freedom is stipulated in the Indonesian constitution,[222] the government officially recognises only six religions: Islam, Protestantism, Roman Catholicism, Hinduism, Buddhism, and Confucianism.[9] Indonesia is the world\'s most populous Muslim majority country, at 87.2% in 2010, with the majority being Sunni Muslims (99%).[223][224][3] The Shias and Ahmadis respectively constitute 0.5% and 0.2% of the Muslim population.[225]\n\nIn 2010, Christians made up almost 10% of the population (7% of the total population was Protestant, 2.9% Roman Catholic), 1.7% were Hindu, and 0.9% were Buddhist or other. Most Indonesian Hindus are Balinese,[226] and most Buddhists in modern-day Indonesia are ethnic Chinese.[227]\n\nThough now minority religions, Hinduism and Buddhism remain defining influences in Indonesian culture. Hindu influences reached the Indonesian Archipelago as early as first century.[228] Salakanagara kingdom, a Sundanese kingdom, is the first historically recorded Indianised kingdom in Indonesia, located in West Java, created by Indian trader after marrying a local Sundanese princess.[229] This Kingdom existed since 130 AD. Islam was first adopted by Indonesians in northern Sumatra in the 13th century, through the influence of traders, and became the country\'s dominant religion by the 16th century.[230]\n\nRoman Catholicism was brought to Indonesia by early Portuguese colonialists and missionaries,[232] and the Protestant denominations are largely a result of Dutch Reformed and Lutheran missionary efforts during the country\'s colonial period.[235] A large proportion of Indonesianssuch as the Javanese abangan, Balinese Hindus, and Dayak Christianspractice a less orthodox, syncretic form of their religion, which draws on local customs and beliefs.[236]\n\nMost of indigenous native Indonesian beliefs could be categorised as animism, shamanism as well ancestral worship. Examples of Indonesian native belief systems are Sundanese Sunda Wiwitan, Dayak\'s Kaharingan, Torajan Aluk\' To Dolo, Manusela and Nuaulu\'s Naurus, Batak\'s Parmalim faith, and to some extent Javanese Kejawen belief. There are also a number of indigenous deities and ancestral worship in Kalimantan, Sulawesi, and Papua.[237][238][239]\n\nAs with many other developing countries, high fertility rate still is a major problem.[240][241][242] Traditionally, the Indonesian society has viewed children as a source of fortune.[240] This contributes to a very high fertility rate and is recognised as a major factor in creating widespread poverty.[243] Indonesia signed the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women in 1980 and ratified it in 1984.[244]\n\nThe Indonesian National Commission on Violence Against Women noted that more regulations that discriminate against women are being adopted throughout the country than are being repealed.[245] In many parts of Indonesia, local laws compelling women and girls to wear the hijab are increasingly in place in schools, government offices and public spaces.[246] Child marriage is also common,[247] and sustained by traditional norms.[248][249]\n\nClose to 80 percent of the Indonesian population lives in the western parts of the country,[250] but that segment of the population is growing at a slower pace than the rest of the country.[240] This creates a gap in terms of wealth, unemployment rate, and health between the densely populated islands like Sumatra and Java, which are the economic centres of Indonesia, and the sparsely populated islands such as Maluku, and Papua which is considered as Indonesia\'s disadvantaged areas.[240][251] Economic inequality is also an issue that not only affects the economy, but also the social structure of Indonesia, resulting in social discrimination.[130][252] Racism, especially against the Chinese since the Dutch rule, is a major and controversial issue and still continues to this day.[253][254]\n\nEducation in Indonesia is compulsory for twelve years.[257][258] Parents can choose between state-run, non sectarian public schools supervised by Ministry of Education and Culture or private or semi-private religious (usually Islamic) schools supervised and financed by the Department of Religious Affairs.[259] The enrolment rate is 94% for primary education (2011), 75% for secondary education, and 27% for tertiary education. The literacy rate is 93% (2011).[260]\n\nBy 2014, there were 118 state universities in Indonesia. Entry to higher education depends on the nationwide entrance examination (SNMPTN and SBMPTN). According to the 2015 Times Higher Education World University Rankings, the top university in Indonesia is University of Indonesia (rank 310, dropped from 201 in 2009), followed by Bandung Institute of Technology (in the 431460 rank range) and Gadjah Mada University (in the 551600 rank range). Five other Indonesian universities, including Airlangga University, Bogor Institute of Agriculture, Diponegoro University, Sepuluh Nopember Institute of Technology and Brawijaya University all huddled in the 701+ range.[261] All of educational institutions located in Java. Andalas University is pioneering the establishment of a leading university outside of Java.[262]\n\nGovernment expenditure on healthcare in Indonesia is about 3.1 percent of its total gross domestic product.[263] Every citizen is protected under Jaminan Kesehatan Nasional (JKN), a scheme to implement universal health care in the country which launched by Ministry of Health of Indonesia. It is expected that spending on healthcare will increase by 12% a year and reach US$46 billion a year by 2019.[264] Under JKN, all Indonesians will receive coverage for a range of treatments via health services from public providers as well as those private organisations that have opted to join the scheme. The 2010 maternal mortality rate per 100,000 births for Indonesia is 240. [265] The main health problems are air quality, disease, child malnutrition, alcohol and smoking. Health outcomes have significantly improved in Indonesia since the 1960s.[266] Life expectancy at birth is 70.8 years.[263][266] The child mortality rate has declined from 220 per 1,000 live births in 1960 to 45 per 1,000 live births in 2007. It has been suggested that over a third of the children under 5 have stunted growth.[266] More than 28 million live below the poverty line of US$17 a month and about half the population have incomes not much above it. The malnutrition status has shown steady progress from 38 percent in 1990 to 25 percent in 2000. The rate of smoking is very high and about 400,000 die each year from smoking related illnesses.[267]\n\nLiving in an agrarian and maritime culture the people in Indonesian\'s archipelago have been famous in some traditional technologies, particularly in agriculture and marine. In agriculture, for instance, the people in Indonesia, and also in many other Southeast Asian countries, are famous in paddy cultivation technique namely terasering. Bugis and Makassar people in Indonesia are also well-known with their technology in making wooden sailing vessel called pinisi boat.[268]\n\nIn aerospace technology, Indonesia has a long history in developing military and small commuter aircraft as the only country in Southeast Asia to produce and develop its own aircraft, also producing aircraft components for Boeing and Airbus, with its state-owned aircraft company (founded in 1976), the Indonesian Aerospace (Indonesian: PT. Dirgantara Indonesia), which, with EADS CASA of Spain developed the CN-235 aircraft, which has been exported to many countries. B. J. Habibie, a former Indonesian president played an important role in this achievement. While active as a professor in Germany, Habibie conducted many research assignments, producing theories on thermodynamics, construction, and aerodynamics, known as the Habibie Factor, Habibie Theorem, and Habibie Method respectively.[269] Indonesia also hopes to manufacture the South Korean KAI KF-X fighter.[270] Indonesia is also the first developing country to launch its own satellite system, known as Palapa.[271] Palapa is a series of communication satellite own by Indosat. The first satellite, PALAPA A1 was first launched on 8 July 1976 Florida time, or on 9 July 1976 Western Indonesian Time on a US rocket, Delta 2914, from the Kennedy Space Center.[272] As of 2016 , Indonesia has launched 11 satellites to connect alongside the archipelago.[273]\n\nIndonesia has a well established railway industry, with its state-owned train manufacturer company, the Indonesian Railway Industry (Indonesian: PT. Industri Kereta Api), located in Madiun, East Java. Since 1982 the company has been producing passenger train wagons, freight wagons and other railway technologies and exported to many countries, such as Malaysia and Bangladesh.[274] In the 1980s an Indonesian engineer, Tjokorda Raka Sukawati invented a road construction technique named Sosrobahu which becomes famous afterwards and widely used by many countries. The technology has been exported to Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and the United States.[275]\n\nWith an estimated userbase of 132,700,000, Indonesia is one of the top ten largest countries by number of Internet users,[276] and its Facebook and Twitter user populations are fourth and third largest, respectively, of any country.[277][278] The majority of Internet users in Indonesia are between the ages of 18 and 25, with an average Internet usage of 4.7 hours daily.[279][280][281] Approximately 85% of Internet users depend primarily on their mobile phones for access, while the number of laptop users is greater than that of personal computer and tablet users combined.[282] The Internet remains a relatively new communication medium in Indonesia. Like other developing countries, Indonesia began Internet development in the early 1990s.[283] Unusually, Indonesia\'s Internet participation began with a small private group, known as the \"Paguyuban Network\", or \"Network Group\".[283] Its first Internet service provider, IndoNet, began operation in Jakarta in mid-1994.[283]\n\nBoth nature and culture are major components of Indonesian tourism. The natural heritage can boast a unique combination of a tropical climate, vast archipelago and long stretch of beaches. These natural attractions are complemented by a rich cultural heritage that reflects Indonesia\'s dynamic history and ethnic diversity. The ancient Prambanan and Borobudur temples, Toraja and Bali, with its Hindu festivities, are some of the popular destinations for cultural tourism.\n\nIndonesia has a well-preserved natural ecosystem with rainforests that stretch over about 57% of Indonesia\'s land (225 million acres). Forests on Sumatra and Kalimantan are examples of popular tourist destinations, such as Orang Utan wildlife reserve. Moreover, Indonesia has one of longest coastlines in the world, measuring 54,716 kilometres (33,999mi).\n\nWith 20% of the world\'s coral reefs, over 3,000 different species of fish and 600 coral species, deep water trenches, volcanic sea mounts, World War II wrecks, and an endless variety of macro life, scuba diving in Indonesia is both excellent and inexpensive.[285] Bunaken National Marine Park, at the northern tip of Sulawesi has more than 70% of all the known fish species of the Indo-Western Pacific Ocean.[286] According to Conservation International, marine surveys suggest that the marine life diversity in the Raja Ampat Islands is the highest recorded on Earth.[287] Moreover, there are over 3,500 species living in Indonesian waters, including sharks, dolphins, manta rays, turtles, morays, cuttlefish, octopus and scorpaenidae, compared to 1,500 on the Great Barrier Reef.\n\nIndonesia has 8 UNESCO World Heritage Sites, such as the Komodo National Park, Cultural Landscape of Bali, Ujung Kulon National Park, Lorentz National Park, Tropical Rainforest Heritage of Sumatra, comprises three national parks on the island of Sumatra: Gunung Leuser National Park, Kerinci Seblat National Park and the Bukit Barisan Selatan National Park; and 18 World Heritage Sites in tentative list, such as the historic urban centres of Jakarta Old Town, Sawahlunto Old Coal Mining Town, Semarang Old Town, as well as Muara Takus Compound Site.[288]\n\nThe heritage tourism is focussed on specific interest on Indonesian history, such as colonial architectural heritage of Dutch East Indies era. The activities among others are visiting museums, churches, forts and historical colonial buildings, as well as spend some nights in colonial heritage hotels. The popular heritage tourism attractions are Jakarta Old Town and the royal Javanese courts of Yogyakarta, Surakarta and the Mangkunegaran.\n\nBali island received the Best Island award from Travel and Leisure in 2010.[289] The island of Bali won because of its attractive surroundings (both mountain and coastal areas), diverse tourist attractions, excellent international and local restaurants, and the friendliness of the local people. According to BBC Travel released in 2011, Bali is one of the World\'s Best Islands, ranking second after Santorini, Greece.[290] Bali is a major world surfing destination, with popular breaks dotted across the southern coastline and around the offshore island of Nusa Lembongan.[291] As part of the Coral Triangle, Bali, including Nusa Penida, offers a wide range of dive sites with varying types of reefs.\n\nUrban tourism activities includes shopping, sightseeing in big cities, or enjoying modern amusement parks, resorts, spas, nightlife and entertainment. Beautiful Indonesia Miniature Park as well as Ancol Dreamland with Dunia Fantasi (Fantasy World) theme park and Atlantis Water Adventure are Jakarta\'s answer to Disneyland-style amusement park and water park. The capital city, Jakarta, is a shopping hub in Southeast Asia. The city has numerous shopping malls and traditional markets. With a total of 550 hectares, Jakarta has the world\'s largest shopping mall floor area within a single city.[292] The annual \"Jakarta Great Sale\" is held every year in June and July to celebrate Jakarta\'s anniversary.[293] Bandung is a popular shopping destination for fashion products among Malaysians and Singaporeans.[294]\n\nSince January 2011, Wonderful Indonesia has been the slogan of an international marketing campaign directed by the Indonesian Ministry of Culture and Tourism to promote tourism.[295] In year 2015, 10.4 million international visitors entered Indonesia, staying in hotels for an average of 8.5 nights and spending an average of US$1,190 per person during their visit, or US$140 per person per day.[296]\n\nIndonesia is a rich country with more than 300 ethnic groups. Each of them has its own art, architecture and housing, cuisine, traditional dress, festivals, music, dance, tradition, ritual, myths, philosophy of life, even language.[297] The cultural identities developed over centuries, and influenced by Indian, Arabic, Chinese, and European sources, resulting in many cultural practices being strongly influenced by a multitude of religions, including Hinduism, Buddhism, Confucianism, Islam and Christianity.[298] The result is a complex and unique cultural mixture that different from the original indigenous cultures. The fusion of Islam with Hindu in Javanese Abangan belief, the fusion of Hinduism, Buddhism and animism in Bodha, and the fusion of Hinduism and animism in Kaharingan.[299] Traditional Javanese and Balinese dances, for example, contain aspects of Hindu culture and mythology, as do wayang kulit (shadow puppet) performances.[300]\n\nTraditional carpentry, masonry, stone and woodwork techniques and decorations are also thrived in Indonesian vernacular architecture, with numbers of traditional houses\' styles has been developed. The traditional houses and settlements of the several hundreds ethnic groups of Indonesia are extremely varied and all have their own specific history.[301]:5\n\nThe Indonesian film industry\'s popularity peaked in the 1980s and dominated cinemas in Indonesia,[302] although it declined significantly in the early 1990s.[303] Between 2000 and 2005, the number of Indonesian films released each year has steadily increased.[302]\n\nAs of 2015 , Indonesia holds 8 items of UNESCO\'s Intangible Cultural Heritage, which include wayang puppet theatre, kris, batik, education and training on making Indonesian batik, angklung, saman dance, noken, and the three genres of traditional Balinese dance.[304] Batik which natives to Indonesia also was recognised by UNESCO as a Masterpiece of Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity on October 2009.[305]\n\nIndonesian art is various artistic expressions and artworks of the archipelagic nation of Indonesia. It is quite difficult to define Indonesian art, since the country is immensely diverse. The sprawling archipelago nation consists of 13,466 islands.[74] Around 922 of those permanently inhabited,[306] by over 300 ethnic groups, which speaking more than 700 living languages.[217] It is either work of arts produced by its peoplecreated by Indonesian artist, or influenced by its culture and traditions. Indonesian arts includes both age-old artforms developed through centuries, and recently developed contemporary art. Despite often displaying local ingenuity, Indonesian arts also has experienced foreign exposures and influencesmost notably from India, Arabia, China and Europe, as the result of centuries of contacts and interactions facilitated, and often motivated, by trade.[308]\n\nThe art of painting is quite well-developed in Bali, where its people are famed for their artistry.[309] The Balinese art paintings tradition started as classical Kamasan or Wayang style visual narrative, derived from East Javanese visual art discovered on East Javanese candi bas reliefs.[309] Balinese painting tradition are notable for its highly vigorous yet refined intricate art which resembles baroque folk art with tropical themes.[309]\n\nMegalithic sculpture has been discovered in several sites in Indonesia.[310] Subsequently, tribal art has flourished within the culture of Nias, Batak, Asmat, Dayak and Toraja.[311] Wood and stone are common materials used as the media for sculpting among these tribes.[311] Between 8th to 15th century, Javanese civilisation has developed a refined stone sculpting art and architecture which was influenced by Hindu-Buddhist Dharmic civilisation. The celebrated example is the temples of Borobudur and Prambanan.[312]\n\nArchitecture reflects the diversity of cultural that have shaped Indonesia as a whole. Invaders, colonisers, missionaries, merchants and traders brought cultural changes that had a profound effect on building styles and techniques. The most dominant influences on Indonesian architecture have traditionally been Indian; however, Chinese, Arab, and European architectural influences have been significant.\n\nThe Indonesia traditional houses are at the centre of a web of customs, social relations, traditional laws, taboos, myths and religions that bind the villagers together. The house provides the main focus for the family and its community, and is the point of departure for many activities of its residents. Traditional houses hold a prominent position in the society, relates to its social significance.[301]\n\nExample of Indonesian vernacular architecture including Toraja\'s Tongkonan, Minangkabau\'s Rumah Gadang and Rangkiang, Javanese style Pendopo pavilion with Joglo style roof, Dayak\'s longhouses, various Malay houses, Balinese houses and temples, and also various styles of lumbung (rice barns).\n\nWith more than 300 ethnic groups, Indonesia is considered as the home of world handicraft.[313] Every ethnic in Indonesia has it own uniqueness, style, and philosophy of craft.[313] Most of them are made from wooden, bone, fabric, stone, paper, and other. Using hands, these natural materials were crafted into useful and aesthetic items.[313] Handicraft manufacturing, unlike most other manufacturing activities, has a social function as well. In Indonesia, handicraft is not just a tradition; it is also an important economic sector.[314] The handicraft industry employs thousands of people in towns and villages across the country. About half a billion dollar worth of handicraft is exported every year, and many more is consumed domestically.[313][314]\n\nThere are many varieties of handicraft from other regions.[313] West Sumatra and South Sumatra are particularly noted for their songket cloths.[315] Villages in Nusa Tenggara produce ikat. Provinces in Kalimantan (Borneo) are long known for their basketry and weaving using rattan and other natural fabrics.[316] Wood art produced by the Asmat people of Papua is highly valued.[317] Along the northern coast, Cirebon, Pekalongan, and Lasem are batik centres.[318] For furniture, the important cities are Cirebon (for rattan) and Jepara (carved wood).[319] Tasikmalaya is known for embroidery.[320] Pasuruan also produces furniture and other products and may support stores and galleries in Bali.[313] Bandung and Surabaya, both are modern, cosmopolitan, and industrialised citiesmuch like Jakarta but on a lesser scale, are creative cities with a variety of innovative startups.[313]\n\nTextiles such as batik, ikat, ulos and songket are several of many Indonesian crafts. Batik, which is origin to Indonesia is the most remarkable as it was recognised by UNESCO as a Masterpiece of Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity on October 2009,[305] and has become the national costume.[321]\n\nAs a multi-diverse country, Indonesia having more than 300 ethnic groups and 34 provinces, each has its own representation of traditional attire and dress from each province with its own unique and distinguished designs.[297] Notable dress such as Kebaya and Batik both of Javanese from Java; Ulos of Batak from North Sumatra; Songket of Malay and Minangkabau from South Sumatra and West Sumatra; and Ikat of Sasak from Lombok.\n\nToday, the most widely recognise Indonesian national costume are Batik[322] and Kebaya, although originally those costumes mainly belong within the culture of Java and Bali, most prominently within Javanese, Sundanese and Balinese culture.[323] National costumes are worn during official occasions as well as traditional ceremonies.[323] The most obvious display of Indonesian national costumes can be seen by the type of costumes worn by the President of Indonesia and the Indonesian first lady in many and different types of occasions and settings, and also worn by Indonesian diplomatic officials during meeting or gala dinner.\n\nThe music of Indonesia predates historical records. Various native Indonesian tribes incorporate chants and songs accompanied with musical instruments in their rituals. Traditional Indonesian instruments include angklung, kacapi suling, siteran, gong, gamelan, degung, gong kebyar, bumbung, talempong, kulintang and sasando.\n\nThe diverse world of Indonesian music genres was the result of the musical creativity of its people, and subsequent cultural encounters with foreign musical influences into the archipelago. Next to distinctive native form of musics, several genres can trace their origins to foreign influences, such as gambus and qasida from Middle Eastern Islamic music,[324] keroncong from Portuguese influences,[325] and dangdutone of the most popular music genres in Indonesiawith notable Hindi music influence as well as Malay orchestras.[326]\n\nToday, Indonesian music industry enjoys nationwide popularity. Thanks to common culture and intelligible languages between Indonesian and Malay, Indonesian music enjoyed regional popularity in neighbouring countries such as Malaysia, Singapore and Brunei. However, the overwhelming popularity of Indonesian music in Malaysia had alarmed the Malaysian music industry. In 2008, Malaysian music industry demanded the restriction of Indonesian songs on Malaysian radio broadcasts.[327]\n\nTraditional dance of Indonesia reflect the rich diversity of Indonesian people. The dance traditions in Indonesia; such as Javanese, Sundanese, Minangkabau, Balinese, Aceh and many other dances traditions are age old traditions, yet also a living and dynamic traditions. Several royal houses; the istanas and keratons still survived in some parts of Indonesia and become the haven of cultural conservation. The obvious difference between courtly dance and common folk dance traditions is the most evident in Javanese dance. The palace court traditions also evident in Balinese and Malay court which usually imposed refinement and prestige. Java and Bali are more deeply rooted in their Hindu-Buddhist heritage, while Sumatran courtly culture such as the remnant of Aceh Sultanate and Palembang Sultanate, are more influenced by Islamic culture.\n\nDances in Indonesia are believed by many scholars to have had their beginning in rituals and religious worship.[328] Such dances are usually based on rituals, like the war dances, the dance of witch doctors, and dance to call for rain or any agricultural related rituals such as Hudoq dance ritual of Dayak people. In Bali, dances has become the integral part of Hindu Balinese rituals. Sacred ritual dances performed only in Balinese temples such as sacred Sanghyang dedari and Barong dance.\n\nThe commoners folk dance is more concerned with social function and entertainment value than rituals. The Javanese Ronggeng and Sundanese Jaipongan is the fine example of this common folk dance traditions. Both are social dances that are more for entertainment purpose than rituals. Randai is a folk theatre tradition of the Minangkabau people which incorporates dance, music, singing, drama and the martial art of silat.[329] Certain traditional folk dances has been developed into mass dance with simple but structurised steps and movements, such as Poco-poco dance from Minahasa and Sajojo dance from Papua.\n\nIndonesian cuisine is one of the most vibrant and colourful cuisines in the world, full of intense flavour.[330] It is diverse, in part because Indonesia is composed of approximately 6,000 populated islands of the total 18,000 in the world\'s largest archipelago,[331] with more than 300 ethnic groups calling Indonesia their home.[332] Many regional cuisines exist, often based upon indigenous culture and foreign influences such as Chinese, European, Middle Eastern, and Indian precedents.[333] Rice is the main staple food and is served with side dishes of meat and vegetables. Spices (notably chili), coconut milk, fish and chicken are fundamental ingredients.[334]\n\nSome popular Indonesian dishes such as nasi goreng,[335] gado-gado,[336][337] sate,[338] and soto[339] are ubiquitous in the country and considered as national dishes. The official national dish of Indonesia however, is tumpeng, chosen in 2014 by Indonesian Ministry of Tourism and Creative Economy as the dish that binds the diversity of Indonesia\'s various culinary traditions.[332] Another popular Indonesian dishes like rendang which is one of many Minangkabau cuisine, beside of dendeng and gulai. In 2011, rendang was chosen as the \"Worlds Most Delicious Food\" that has been announced by CNN. Rendang can be made from beef that is slowly simmered with coconut milk and a mixture of lemongrass, galangal, garlic, turmeric, ginger and chilies, then left to stew for a few hours to make it tender, flavourful bovine goodness. Another fermented food such as oncom, similar in some ways to tempeh but using a variety of bases (not only soy), created by different fungi, and particularly popular in West Java.\n\nWayang, the Javanese, Sundanese, and Balinese shadow puppet theatre shows display several mythological legends such as Ramayana and Mahabharata, and many more.[340][341] Wayang wong is Javanese traditional dance drama based on wayang stories.[342] Various Balinese dance drama also can be included within traditional form of Indonesian drama. Another form of local drama is Javanese Ludruk and Ketoprak, Sundanese Sandiwara, and Betawi Lenong.[343][344][345] All of these drama incorporated humor and jest, often involving audiences in their performance.[346]\n\nRandai is a folk theatre tradition of the Minangkabau people of West Sumatra, usually performed for traditional ceremonies and festivals.[347] It incorporates music, singing, dance, drama and the silat martial art, with performances often based on semi-historical Minangkabau legends and love story.[347]\n\nModern performing art also developed in Indonesia with their distinct style of drama. Notable theatre, dance, and drama troupe such as Teater Koma are gain popularity in Indonesia as their drama often portray social and political satire of Indonesian society.[348]\n\nSports in Indonesia are generally male-oriented and spectator sports are often associated with illegal gambling. The most popular sports are badminton and football. Indonesian players have won the Thomas Cup (the world team championship of men\'s badminton) thirteen of the twenty-six times that it has been held since 1949, as well as numerous Olympic medals since the sport gained full Olympic status in 1992. Indonesian women have won the Uber Cup, the female equivalent of the Thomas Cup, 3 times, in 1975, 1994 and 1996. Liga Super Indonesia is the country\'s premier football club league.\n\nOn the international stage, Indonesia experienced limited success despite being the first Asian team to qualify for the FIFA World Cup in 1938 as Dutch East Indies.[350] In 1956, the football team played in the Olympics and played a hard-fought draw against the Soviet Union. On the continent level, Indonesia won the bronze medal once in football in the 1958 Asian Games. Indonesia\'s first appearance in Asian Cup was back in 1996. The Indonesian national team qualified for the Asian Cup in 2000, 2004 and 2007 AFC Asian Cup, however unable to move through next stage.\n\nBasketball has a long history in Indonesia and was part of the first Indonesian National Games in 1948.[351] Boxing is a popular combative sport spectacle in Indonesia. Some of famous Indonesian boxers are Ellyas Pical, three times IBF Super flyweight champion; Nico Thomas, Muhammad Rachman, and Chris John.[352] For racing sport, Indonesia has Rio Haryanto who become the first Indonesian to compete in Formula One.[353]\n\nTraditional sports include sepak takraw, and bull racing in Madura. In areas of Indonesia with a history of tribal warfare, mock fighting contests are held, such as caci in Flores and pasola in Sumba. Pencak Silat is an Indonesian martial art and in 1987, became one of the sporting events in Southeast Asian Games, with Indonesia appearing as one of the leading forces in this sport. In Southeast Asia, Indonesia is one of the major sport powerhouses by winning the Southeast Asian Games 10 times since 1977.\n\nThe first domestically produced film in Indonesia was in 1926: Loetoeng Kasaroeng, a silent film by Dutch director L. Heuveldorp. This adaptation of the Sundanese legend was made with local actors by the NV Java Film Company in Bandung.\n\nAfter independence, the film industry expanded rapidly, with six films made in 1949 rising to 58 in 1955. Djamaluddin Malik\'s Persari often emulating American genre films and the working practices of the Hollywood studio system, as well as remaking popular Indian films.[354] The Sukarno government used cinema for nationalistic, anti-Western purposes. Foreign film imports were banned. After the overthrow of Sukarno by Suharto\'s New Order regime, films were regulated through a censorship code that aimed to maintain the social order.[355] Usmar Ismail, a director from West Sumatra made a major imprint in Indonesian film in the 1950s and 1960s.[356]\n\nFilms made in the 1980s included Pintar-pintar Bodoh (1982), Maju Kena Mundur Kena (1984), Nagabonar (1987), Catatan Si Boy (1989), and Warkop\'s comedy films, directed by Arizal. Actors included Deddy Mizwar, Eva Arnaz, Meriam Bellina, and Rano Karno.\n\nIndonesia has held annual film festivals an awards, the Indonesian Film Festival (Festival Film Indonesia/FFI), which has been held intermittently since 1955. This festival hands out the Citra Award, an Indonesian counterpart of United State\'s Academy Awards, the most prestigious award among Indonesian film workers. From 1973 to 1992, the festival was held annually and then discontinued until it was later revived in 2004.\n\nUnder the Reformasi movement, independent filmmaking was a rebirth of the filming industry in Indonesia, where film\'s started addressing topics which were previously banned such as; religion, race, love and other topics.[355] Riri Riza and Mira Lesmana were the new generation of Indonesian film figures who co-directed of Kuldesak (1999), Petualangan Sherina (2000), Ada Apa dengan Cinta? (2002), Gie (2005), and Laskar Pelangi (2008).[357] Locally made film quality has gone up in 2012, this is attested by the international release of films such as The Raid: Redemption,[358] Modus Anomali, Dilema, Lovely Man, and Java Heat.\n\nMedia freedom in Indonesia increased considerably after the end of President Suharto\'s rule, during which the now-defunct Ministry of Information monitored and controlled domestic media, and restricted foreign media.[359] The TV market includes ten national commercial networks, and provincial networks that compete with public TVRI. For 27 years, Indonesians could only watch one television channel, TVRI. By early in the new century, the improved communications system had brought television signals to every village in the country, and most Indonesians could choose from 14 channels.[360][361] Private radio stations carry their own news bulletins and foreign broadcasters supply programs. At a reported 25 million users in 2008,[362] The number of printed publications has increased significantly since 1998.[363] In 2016, 88 million Indonesians used the Internet, of which 93% used smartphones, 5% tablets and 11% computers. Broadband reached 8% of the households.[364][365] More than 30 million cell phones are sold in Indonesia each year, and 27% of them are local brands.[366]\n\nThe oldest evidence of writing in Indonesia is a series of Sanskrit inscriptions dated to the 5th century. Many of Indonesia\'s peoples have strongly rooted oral traditions, which help to define and preserve their cultural identities.[367] In written poetry and prose, a number of traditional forms dominate, mainly syair, pantun, gurindam, hikayat and babad. Some of these works are Syair Raja Siak, Syair Abdul Muluk, Hikayat Abdullah, Hikayat Bayan Budiman, Hikayat Hang Tuah, Sulalatus Salatin, and Babad Tanah Jawi.[368]\n\nEarly modern Indonesian literature originates in Sumatran tradition.[369] Balai Pustaka, the government bureau for popular literature, was instituted around 1920 to promote the development of indigenous literature, it adopted Malay as the preferred common medium for Indonesia. Important figures in modern Indonesian literature include: Dutch author Multatuli, who criticised treatment of the Indonesians under Dutch colonial rule; Sumatrans Mohammad Yamin and Hamka, who were influential pre-independence nationalist writers and politicians; and proletarian writer Pramoedya Ananta Toer, Indonesia\'s most famous novelist. Pramoedya earned several accolades, and was frequently discussed as Indonesia\'s and Southeast Asia\'s best candidate for a Nobel Prize in Literature.[373]\n\nIndonesian literature and poetry flourished even more in the first half of the 20th century. Chairil Anwar was considered as the greatest literary figure of Indonesia by American poet and translator, Burton Raffel.[374] He was among those youngsters who pioneered in changing the traditional Indonesian literature and modifying it on the lines of the newly independent country. Some of his popular poems include Krawang-Bekasi, Diponegoro and Aku. Other major authors include Marah Roesli (Sitti Nurbaya), Merari Siregar (Azab dan Sengsara), Abdul Muis (Salah Asuhan), Djamaluddin Adinegoro (Darah Muda), Sutan Takdir Alisjahbana (Layar Terkembang), and Amir Hamzah (Nyanyi Sunyi) whose works are among the most well known in Maritime Southeast Asia.[375]','2017-03-25 03:51:12'),(85,13,'0c25fa889de0724e1c1ac99f7206af75da46d00868784cbef0f98fb41bf29179','460c4ea713d8476bb7eb033b6c761832','','','JAKARTA, Indonesia Like most of her Muslim peers, Sarah Hajar Mahmudah, a 21-year-old international relations major at the State Islamic University, wears a tight scarf around her head.\n\nShes proud of her faith and equally proud of her countrys long reputation for religious tolerance and coexistence.\n\nAnd like many Indonesians, she is an avid social media consumer, spending about two hours a day, browsing Facebook, posting to Twitter and Instagram, pausing to view a handful of YouTube videos.\n\nBut over the past few years, shes noticed a worrying trend.\n\nSocial media is a problem for religious diversity in this country, she said, pausing to talk at a cafe in a bustling Jakarta mall.\n\nEarlier this month, at a mass protest in Jakarta, Muslim hard-liners pressed for the resignation of the capitals governor, a Christian they say insulted the Quran.\n\nThe furor over the alleged insult was sparked after a video circulated online in which the governor lightheartedly cited a verse in the Quran that warns against taking Christians and Jews as friends and said that he should be prosecuted and jailed under Indonesias blasphemy laws. He later apologized.\n\nIndonesia, the worlds largest Muslim-majority nation, is one of the most voracious users of social media.\n\nAn estimated 76 million Indonesians regularly log on to Facebook, making the Asian archipelago nation the worlds fourth-largest user (after India, the U.S. and Brazil). The country is the fifth-largest user of Twitter (after the U.S., Brazil, Japan and the U.K.)\n\nBoth Google and Facebook have recently come under criticism for allowing fake news on their sites, which some have suggested may have influenced the U.S. presidential elections. The internet giants both responded by saying they will not tolerate misinformation.\n\nWhile most agree that tech companies must do more to filter out hoaxes, an experiment soon to be launched in Indonesia may be one small corrective to the wider problem of false narratives and misleading information on the internet.\n\nIt started two years ago when Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg flew to Indonesia to meet with President Joko Widodo. The two discussed how the tech giant could help support Indonesian microbusinesses and increase internet access in rural areas.\n\nLess noted was another item on the agenda: How could Facebook help the worlds third-largest democracy bridge its diversity challenges?\n\nIndonesia has more than 6,000 inhabited islands, dozens of ethnic groups and a multitude of religions.\n\nUnity in Diversity (Bhinneka Tunggal Ika) was proclaimed the national motto when Indonesia declared independence from Dutch colonial rule at the end of World War II.\n\nBut peaceful coexistence is not always the norm, and as the country struggles to live up to its motto, its finding that social media is a double-edged sword.\n\nMuch has been written about the ways the self-styled Islamic State group has manipulated social media to recruit foreign fighters to Iraq and Syria. But social media is also having a negative effect on social cohesion in other regions of the world, where it is often viewed as a tool for inflaming hatred, reinforcing biases and spreading misinformation.\n\nWhich is why Facebook asked Affinis Labs, a Falls Church, Va.-based group that specializes in running social impact hackathons, to organize an event in Jakarta to encourage religious and cultural diversity.\n\nIn June, at two co-working office spaces in Jakarta, 25 Indonesians from across the country were invited to come together, including Mahmudah, who applied at the suggestion of one of her professors.\n\nThe idea was to generate ideas around social issues, said Tony Pribadi, a startup entrepreneur who splits his time between Indonesia and the U.S. First they talked about the issues. Then they picked one topic to work on.\n\nOver the past decade, hackathons have proved popular as a way to bring programming geeks together to work on a unique solution to a technological problem.\n\nThe events are addictively high-energy, as teams work around the clock and under tight deadlines  events typically last 48 hours  to come up with a programming prototype that they can demo for prizes.\n\nBut Affinis Labs tweaked the hackathon model to focus on finding social solutions to problems such as hate speech and violent extremism.\n\nFounded nearly two years ago by Obama administration consultants on American Muslim engagement Quintan Wiktorowicz and Shahed Amanullah, the organization has acquired a reputation for using the hackathon model to find solutions to counter radicalization and promote positive narratives and social entrepreneurship.\n\nFacebook came to us and said: Listen, Indonesia is a huge market for Facebook. Can you do something to promote diversity? said Wajahat Ali, creative director for Affinis Labs and a host/contributor at The Huffington Post. We wanted to come up with innovative, impactful and scalable solutions that can amplify Indonesian values of co-existence, diversity and pluralism.\n\nOver the course of the three-day event, dubbed Beda Tapi Satu or Different But One, participants were split up into five teams and asked to home in on a social problem that needed fixing and propose a solution.\n\nMahmudah, the international relations student, teamed up with Reggy Hasibuan, a 47-year-old stand-up comedian. The two, along with three others, hammered out the problem: Social media is fueling a cottage industry of online hoaxes and fake news that spreads misinformation and foments hatred among Indonesian faith traditions.\n\nOne online hoax alleged non-Muslims were responsible for torching a mosque in Papua, Indonesias easternmost province; another falsely alleged an Australian company was crossbreeding sheep with pigs so as to defile Indonesias halal meat supply (Muslims do not eat pork).\n\nHoaxes dont always involve Muslims. One fake news meme alleged a statue of Jesus in India was miraculously weeping tears when in fact water from a stopped-up bathroom was dripping onto the sculpture.\n\nFake news quickly goes viral online  often spinning out of control. Less troubling, but also of concern, are accurate memes distorted and twisted over time.\n\nOne way to bust these hoaxes, the team decided, was to counter them with a series of quick, punchy and  most important  funny online videos.\n\nHumor, said Mahmudah, can enlighten people about the truth. No matter who you are, you can appreciate a good joke.\n\nThe videos, the team proposed, would live on a special website dubbed Asiknaja.com, or Lighten Up in Bahasa, the official language of Indonesia.\n\nThe teams solution won first place in the hackathon. Mahmudah and Hasibuan have since completed 10 short video clips that aim to debunk online rumors such as NASA has changed the signs of the zodiac and Mark Zuckerberg has converted to Islam.\n\nThe three- to five-minute video clips are now being edited. Mahmudah and Hasibuan have plans for another 10 videos. They will post them to a new website, YouTube and various social media outlets.\n\nIn Indonesia, the understanding of other religions is very lacking, said Hasibuan, a nonpracticing Roman Catholic who grew up surrounded by Muslims.\n\nYoure taught at an early age that your religion is the best. This justifies a lot of wrongs that happen afterward.\n\nOne wrong is radicalization, which both Mahmudah and Hasibuan are committed to fighting.\n\nWhile the Indonesian Constitution provides for freedom of religion, international human rights organizations report persistent attacks and intimidation against religious minorities and atheists.\n\nIts not only non-Muslim faiths that face hostility. Indonesias Ahmadiyya community is increasingly targeted, as are Shiite Muslims.\n\nMahmudah points out that Indonesia was once a Hindu society and that Islam spread across Southeast Asia through commerce rather than war or military conquest.\n\nShe wants the country to be known for a friendly and tolerant version of Islam, and she believes challenging misinformation is critical to that effort.\n\nHumor, she added, may help.','2017-03-25 03:51:12'),(86,13,'0c25fa889de0724e1c1ac99f7206af75da46d00868784cbef0f98fb41bf29179','71c6eaa38876423285810fcf254b7308','','','The Indonesian Minister of Communications and Information, Rudiantara expressed hope that the phenomena of hoax news would be discussed in the series of the Commemoration of World Press Freedom Day 2017.

As a result press industry and public are likely disadvantaged. How Indonesian press industry deal with this hoax issue should be presented in a discussion,\" he said.\n\nMinister Rudiantara said further, according to law of Information and electronic transactions the Indonesian government has authority to control access to the false information. But without support from various sides especially the agreement of the press, it is very difficult to curb the spread of false information. The minister hopes in the next two months the organizing committee of the World Press Freedom Day 2017 could prepare the discussion on the effort to curb the spread of false information. (andy/trans r)\n\n==== Chairman of the Jakarta Election Commission (KPU) Sumarno has urged the candidates of the Jakarta regional head elections to abide by the regulations during the cooling-off period by not campaigning. Sumarno said on Tuesday that during the cooling-off period, all candidate pairs, campaign teams, volunteers and supporters must refrain from any activities considered as campaigning activities. He made the statement after attending a coordinating meeting with the Jakarta Police, the Jakarta Military Command, the acting Jakarta Governor, and chairman of the Jakarta Election Supervisory Office (Bawaslu). The KPU has explained the three Jakarta gubernatorial candidate pairs about the cooling-off period. The local commission has asked the candidates to remove all banners and other campaigning materials in public places. The Internet accounts of the candidates must be closed down during the cooling-off period from Feb 12 to 14, 2017. Regional head elections, locally called Pilkada, will be organized simultaneously in 101 regions on February 15, 2017. The KPU added that the elections, held in seven provinces of Jakarta, Aceh, Banten, Bangka Belitung, Gorontalo, West Papua and West Sulawesi.

In a consumer survey publication, BI had announced on Monday night in Jakarta that the index of current economic conditions (IKE) at the end of January 2017 improved as compared to December 2016 and November 2016. Executive Director of BIs Department of Communication Tirta Segara stated that the economic condition is currently up 1.4 points to reach 104.2 points as compared to December 2016. As part of a monthly consumer survey in January 2017, the central bank conducted a study of 4,600 households in 18 cities in Indonesia. He noted that the increased consumer perception was driven by a rise in the current income index, the availability of employment, and the timely purchase of durable goods. BI has recorded that the increase in consumer perception of current economic conditions is the highest in Makassar at 25.5 points. It is followed by 23.4 points in Ambon. Based on the level of consumption, an increase in perception was observed among consumers, with a spending level of Rp2 to Rp3 million.

Minister of Communications and Information Rudiantara in a Seminar on Preparation for Commemoration of World Press Freedom Day (WPFD) 2017 and Socialization of Press Freedom Index (IKP) 2016, Tuesday in Ambon, Maluku said that the technical preparation for Commemoration of World Press Freedom Day has been started. The government is still waiting for the Presidential Decree for the event.\n\n\"We are a country of diversity. It is an added value for us as the host of the World Press Freedom Day. We will be first Asian country to host the World Press Freedom Day. And I think this should be utilized not only to be a good host, but we can export, sell something from our press industry that does not exist in other countries. Of course it has also indirect positive implications for tourism. More than 100 countries will attend the event. This is a press event, they would likely report it in their countries.\"\n\nFurthermore, Minister Rudiantara said that being host of the World Press Freedom Day 2017 is a prestigious opportunity achieved by Indonesia. He confirmed his commitment to the best preparation for the event. In addition to the discussion on the issues of the press and media industry, the World Press Freedom Day 2017 will also emphasize the inclusiveness of the media and the principles of justice adhered by journalists worldwide. Rudiantara also said, Indonesia will also emphasize the discussion on efforts to promote the welfare of journalists in order to maintain a commitment to produce a fair, impartial and honest journalism.(ndy)\n\nPositive momentum of economic improvement to continue in 2017: Minister\n\n==== Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati believed that the national economic performance will continue to improve this year with the same momentum as it did last year. She said on Tuesday that the government wants to maintain the positive momentum in 2017. Hence, the government needs to work harder to address a wide range of fundamental issues. The minister added that one of the efforts to maintain the economic performance in 2017 is to strengthen the national economic fundamentals by using fiscal instruments and policies. She stated if the economy has wider foundations, in terms of economic agents and sectors, the government will be able to build an economy which is more resistant to global effects. She noted that the government has been making efforts to improve the performance in the investment sector and government consumption, which did not contribute significantly to the 2016 economic growth. She remarked that the investment sector, which only grew 4.48 percent last year, will become one of the target areas of improvement, because the government has issued a series of economic policy packages. (antara)\n\n==== Indonesia is keen to increase business opportunities with South Africa following the visit of Indonesian Minister of Foreign Affairs Retno Marsudi to Africas southernmost country. Marsudi stated during a visit to South Africa, as quoted in a press statement on Tuesday that Indonesia and South Africa share several historical similarities, and this has served as a strong foundation in developing mutual economic cooperation. Minister Marsudi met South African Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation Maite Nkoana-Mashabane in Cape Town, South Africa. The two ministers conducted a Joint Commission for Bilateral Cooperation, which was focused on improving economic cooperation between both nations. Marsudi brought along several representatives of Indonesian state-owned enterprises and businessmen during the visit to South Africa. The envoys explored business opportunities with their South African counterparts to identify cooperation potentials in several sectors, such as strategic industry, finance, and transportation. The minister affirmed that Indonesia and South Africa have agreed to encourage businessmen to use the wide-open opportunities existing in the two countries.

Indonesia is also the first Asian Country to become the guest country of the biennial festival. From October 2017 until January 2018 Indonesia will show the art and culture of the country in the cultural performances as well as gastronomic, film and literature exhibitions. The General Coordinator Europalia Indonesia, Makarim Wibisono in an interview with RRI World Service in Jakarta on Tuesday said, being the guest country of the festival held since 1969 is a good opportunity. The Festival could increase the number of European tourists in Indonesia up to more than 1 million people. Makarim explained, in the festival Indonesia will be displayed as an archipelago country with biodiversity, cultural heritage and tolerant society.\n\n\"The essence is the ocean of Becoming, how the biggest archipelago country in the world has become an entity that develops through three patterns. We are rich of biodiversity. There will be a maritime exhibition in la Boverie Museum in Liege. In addition, the greatness of Indonesia was inspired by the wisdom our ancestors. So there will be an exhibition of ancestors. This is the time for Indonesia to share with other nations about the diversity of Indonesia. The tolerance and the pluralism can be implemented since 1945.\"\n\nMakarim Wibisono further explained, Belgian people are fond of cartoons. Therefore, Indonesia will present Indonesian cartoons ranging from traditional cartoons like Mahabharata and Ramayana, to the modern one. So far, Indonesia has prepared 225 dancers, 54 dance performances and 16 types of dance. Indonesia has also prepared 25 musical groups consisting of 172 musicians and 76 performances. In addition there will be performances of theater and film screenings. Europalia Festival is scheduled to be opened by President Joko Widodo and King Philippe in Brussels on October 10, 2017.

The World islands are composed mainly of sand dredged from Dubai\'s shallow coastal waters, and are one of several artificial island developments in Dubai. The World\'s developer is Nakheel Properties, and the project was originally conceived by Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, the ruler of Dubai.\n\nConstruction of the 300 islands began in 2003, only to halt due to the 2008 financial crisis.[2] Though 60 percent of the islands had been sold off to private contractors back in 2008, development on most of these islands has failed to initiate.[3] As of late 2013, only two of the islands had been developed. In January, 2014, Kleindienst Group announced the launch of \"The Heart of Europe\" project;[4] by February, 2014, one of Kleindienst Group\'s brands - JK Properties\' announced in their monthly newsletter that the project was \"well underway\".[5] The first of these series of islands will be Europe, Sweden and Germany with development led by Kleindienst Group, the Developer for The Heart of Europe project. The floating Sea horse villas at St. Petersburg Island are scheduled to be delivered in Dec 2016 and the booking starts at 20%.\n\nAs of July 2012, the Lebanon Island was developed and was \'the only island that has so far been developed commercially, is used for private corporate events and public parties.\n\nIslands in the project range from 14,000 to 42,000 square metres (150,000 to 450,000sqft) in area. Distances between islands average 100 metres (330ft); they are constructed from 321,000,000 cubic metres (1.131010cuft) of sand and 386 million tons of rock. Designed by Creative Kingdom Dubai, the development is an area that covers 6 by 9 kilometres (3.7 by 5.6mi) and is surrounded by an oval-shaped breakwater island. Roughly 232km (144mi) of shoreline was created. The World\'s overall development costs were estimated at $14 billion USD in 2005.\n\nThe project was unveiled in May 2003 by Sheikh Mohammed[6] and dredging began four months later in September 2003.[6] By January 2008, 60% of the islands were sold, 20 of which were bought in the first four months of 2007.[6] On 10 January 2008 the final stone on the breakwater was laid, completing development of the archipelago.[6] As of July 2012, a second island, the Lebanon Island was developed and was \'the only island that has so far been developed commercially, is used for private corporate events and public parties.\' [7]\n\nThe Times Online reported in September 2009 that work on The World had been suspended due to the effects of the global financial crisis.[8][9] And in February 2010 the Daily Mail reported that the islands had started sinking back into the sea.[10] This was later denied by Nakheel and independent technical reports as wholly inaccurate.[11] Despite the denial, The Daily Telegraph reported in January 2011 that an independent company, Penguin Marine, provided verification on the erosion of the islands and the silting of the passageways between the islands.[12] Due to finance and technical problems, Penguin Marine, the company contracted to provide transportation to the archipelago, is attempting to get out of the annual fees of $1.6 million paid to Nakheel properties.[12]\n\nAs of early 2011, only one of the islands had been occupied by a building (a show home) on it,[2] and commercial or residential properties were not currently being constructed on any of the other islands. Property prices in the Emirates had fallen 58 percent from their peak in the fourth quarter of 2008.[13] The world economic recovery from the Great Recession has resulted in a rebound for the Dubai real estate market: it has been reported that \"residential prices [in Dubai] rose by 17.9% from August 2012 to 2013, while rents soared by 14.9% in the same period.\" [14]\n\nIrish investor/businessman John O\'Dolan, who purchased the \"Ireland\" island, committed suicide in February 2009, after his consortium fell into financial difficulty.[15]\n\nThe World was supposed to be serviced by four major transportation hubs linked by waterways. Land parcels are supposedly zoned for various uses: estate, mid density, high density, resorts and commercial.[16] A Dubai Infinity Holdings construction planner has stated that developers have been negotiating with Nakheel about temporary siting of a cement batching plant on one of the islands to supply subdivided construction.[17]\n\nThe plan was for utilities to be routed under water, with water plants at each of the hubs pumping fresh water to the islands. Power was to be supplied by the Dubai Grid and distributed through underwater cables, however as of February 2015 no cables had been laid, so that developers currently have to provide their own power from diesel generators. Waste water and refuse systems are an individual concern for each island.[16]\n\nNakheel Group is itself further developing a resort named Coral Island over 20 islands that make up the North American part of The World. The low-rise development will include a marina and hotel village.[18] The second largest confirmed development is the purchase of 14 islands that make up Australia and New Zealand by Investment Dar of Kuwait. The islands are being terraformed to be developed as a resort named OQYANA.[19]\n\nIrish business consortium Larionovo had plans to develop the Ireland island into an Irish-themed resort.[20] The plans include a large internal marina, apartments and villas, a gym, hotel, and an Irish-themed pub. In July 2007 it was announced that the Ireland Island would feature a recreation of Northern Ireland\'s Giant\'s Causeway. However, on 25 November 2008 a provisional liquidator was appointed to Larionovo.[21] The islands of Great Britain and Moscow on The World were acquired by Premier Real Estate Bureau in the Summer of 2008. News was leaked in a Daily Mail article of January 2009, refuting claims that Great Britain was owned by Richard Branson, Rod Stewart or John O\'Dolan.[22]\n\nIn April 2008, Salya Corporation announced that it had acquired the islands of Finland and Brunei in The World and planned to develop them into fashion-themed resorts. Salya spent about Dh800 million ($218 million USD) to purchase the islands and plans to spend a further Dh2.4 billion ($654 million USD) on development. Brunei Island will be turned into a Fashion TV resort and Finland Island will be turned into a fashion community called FTV palace.[23]\n\nSafi Qurashi, the seven-time multi-millionaire entrepreneur [24] at the head of Premier, and his business partner Mustafa Nagri, paid an estimated $64 million USD for the 4.5-hectare (11-acre) piece of land; he was later convicted for non-payment of cheques and sentenced to seven years in jail.[25]\n\nJosef Kleindienst and his firm JK Properties are developing The Heart of Europe, a collection of six islands (Germany, Sweden, St. Petersburg, Main Europe, Switzerland and Monaco) in the European section of the World, into an island luxury resort.[26] The resort is meant to create a fully immersive European experience, with outdoor snow,[27] and stores accepting only the EURO as a currency.[28]','2017-03-25 03:51:12'),(88,13,'0c25fa889de0724e1c1ac99f7206af75da46d00868784cbef0f98fb41bf29179','288067fbb28e483796ba3f6b0e73cd3b','','','FLORES, Indonesia  With more than 13,000 islands, Indonesia is the worlds largest archipelago. Only about 6,000 of the islands are inhabited, but that still leaves a lot of options for island-hopping.\n\nMost travellers know about Bali, the surf-and-sand island of Eat, Pray, Love fame, and Java, home to Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia, and 60 per cent of the countrys population.\n\nBut I recently travelled with friends to two lesser-known  though still tourist-friendly  islands, and from there, a few even smaller islands, that gave glimpses of local culture while offering heart-stirring views of serene aqua water, dazzling waterfalls and thrilling volcano peaks.\n\nNext door to world-famous Bali, Lombok offers many of the same attractions as its better-know neighbour: waterfalls, white-sand beaches, snorkeling and scuba diving, but with a fraction of the tourists. Here are some of its top destinations:\n\nSenggigi: Located on the northwest part of Lombok, Senggigi is the main tourist area lined with hotels, restaurants, souvenir shops, massage parlours and more. The town of Senggigi is where visitors can set up tours or find guides to take them to different parts of the island.\n\nSendang Gile and Tiu Kelep waterfalls: Icy, cold and slippery, these waterfalls are probably some of the most awe-inspiring sights on the island. We hired a guide to lead us to them.\n\nAuthentic handicrafts: Banyumulek is a village known for its world-class pottery. We visited a family of three generations creating pieces of various sizes. Farther inland, Sukarara is a community where visitors can learn about the process of traditional hand-weaving and attempt to give it a try themselves. Pottery is available for purchase at Banyumulek, and sarongs, wall hangings, blankets and scarves are available for purchase at Sukarara.\n\nGili islands: A string of three tiny islands off the northern coast of Lombok, the Gili islands are popular for their laidback feel and lack of traffic. We headed to Gili Air because it was the closest, hiring a private speedboat and driver and spending a few hours walking around the island and jumping in and out of the water. Dont forget to get your picture taken at one of the well-known water swings.\n\nKnown mainly for being the jumping-off point to Komodo National Park, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, the island of Flores is much larger than you may think. I made the mistake of thinking we could fly into the city of Maumere  the largest town on the island  and take local transport to the western side of the island and head on to the Komodo area. I was wrong. It turned out to be at least a 12-hour drive, and with just a few days on Flores, we decided to stick around Maumere instead of being rushed. But we were not disappointed.\n\nOne interesting aspect of visiting Flores was the Christian influence here. Indonesia is the worlds largest majority-Muslim country, but here Christian churches and a large cross can be seen along the coast. Flores means flowers in Portuguese; it was a colonial outpost for Portugal in the 16th century.\n\nLocal market: An authentic slice of life here, with vendors selling fruit, livestock and chatting with each other and customers.\n\nPangabatang Island: We decided on the fly to try to visit Pangabatang Island, an uninhabited island about an hour off the coast of Flores. With the help of some friendly locals, we flagged down a bemo, a public transport van, found out one of the women on board was married to a boat captain, and headed to meet him at the fishing village of Nangahale. He spoke no English, but I was able to communicate with my rudimentary Indonesian language skills, and we hopped on his rickety boat. We sat in stunned silence snapping photos of some of the most scenic water views wed ever seen. Once at Pangabatang, we suntanned, jumped in and out of the sea, and, of course, took selfies. One note of warning: Ferry sinkings and boat accidents are not uncommon  including a glass-bottomed boat that capsized off Bali in early November, killing three people including a Japanese tourist. So use your judgment on boat rides, especially if travelling with kids.\n\nMount Egon: Hiking Mount Egon takes several hours and lots of stamina. Its very steep with lots of loose gravel. We hired a guide to take us up to the summit, where a volcanic crater and outstanding views made the trek worth it.\n\nLearn a little bit of the language, Bahasa Indonesia, and it will help tremendously.\n\nBeing on time is relative. A 7 a.m. meeting time with your guide may actually mean 8 a.m. Sip some coffee and wait.\n\nThere are three time zones across Indonesia. Keep this in mind when booking flights.\n\nSeveral direct flights go from the Indonesian capital city of Jakarta and from Bali to Lombok each day.\n\nGetting to Flores is more complicated and takes longer. From Jakarta, flights can connect through Bali or even Kupang. Be ready for small planes, small airports and adventure.\n\nSlow ferries between the islands are also an option.','2017-03-25 03:51:12'),(89,13,'0c25fa889de0724e1c1ac99f7206af75da46d00868784cbef0f98fb41bf29179','5d41bcef35c64716b4dcd959028caa99','','','While many islands are known for their natural beauty, there are islands dotting the world\'s seas that were formed by man rather than Mother Nature. Some of these man-made islands were created for flood protection, some were developed for tourism and others serve as wildlife sanctuaries. While many of these creations are true feats of engineering, there have been reports on the ecological impact of some of these artificial islands. Dubai\'s mega-projects such as the World Islands and the Palm Jumeirah, for example, are projects \"so substantial that they have changed the ecologyin ways that are only going to become clear in decades,\" said Peter Sale, a marine ecologist at the United Nations University (UNU) Institute for Water, Environment and Health and co-author of a report on the impact of development of the Gulf.\n\nHere, we explore some of the world\'s most incredible artificial islands.\n\n1. Our Lady of the Rocks, Montenegro\n\nLocated off the coast of Perast in Bay of Kotor, Montenegro, Our Lady of the Rocks is a small artificial islandcreated by bulwark of rocks and by sinking old and seized ships loaded with rocks. Residents of Perast has continued this practice as an annual tradition. Every July 22nd, citizens take their boats and throw rocks into the sea in a custom known as fainada, according to Atlas Obscura.\n\nOur Lady of the Rocks is the Adriatic Sea\'s only artificial island and it is home to a Catholic church, the Church of Our Lady of the Rocks, which has an attached museum. The church houses68 oil canvases by Baroque masters and over 2,500 gold and silver tablets, according to Montenegro.com. To get to the island, visitors can take boats that travel to and from Perast for around three euros.\n\nPart of the planned Palm Islands, a cluster of \"manufactured\" islands in the United Arab Emirates, Palm Jumeirahis an artificial archipelago designed in the shape of a palm tree. It consists of a trunk, a crown with 16 fronds, and a surrounding crescent island that forms an 6.8-mile-long breakwater and is now the home of the luxury resort Palm Atlantis Hotel. Construction on the Palm began in 2001, and it added 40 miles to Dubai\'s coastline. Once complete, the island will have hotel rooms and homes for 65,000 people, according to Guardian.\n\nThe Palm was created using7 million tons of rock, according to its developer Nakheel. The island also includes a curved breakwater using natural rock, intended to encourage the creation of a natural reef and provide habitats for sea life.In 2009, the Palm Jumeirah Monorail opened to the public. It\'s the first monorail in the Middle East, and connects the trunk of Palm Jumeirah and the Atlantis Aquaventure Station on the crescent and will ultimately connect the archipelago to the mainland.\n\nIleaux Cygnes(\"Isle of the Swans\"), a narrow artificial island in the river Seine in Paris, France was formed in 1872 to protect the port of Grenelle. It is home to a tree-lined walkway, the\"l\'Alle des Cygnes\" that runs the length of the island, and a replica of the Statue of Liberty. Standing 72 feet high and facing west in the direction of its big sister in New York, the monument was gifted to France by the American community of Paris.The statue initially faced east, toward the Eiffel Tower, but it was turned west in 1937 for the World Fair in Paris.\n\nAlso in Dubai, located 2.5 miles off the coast, another mega-project involving artificial islands will be the location of luxury hotels and homes. Unveiled in 2003, The World is an artificial archipelago of 300 small islands,composed mainly of sand dredged from the shallow coastal waters, to be constructed in the shape of a world map. However, it seems all is not well with The World. The project was delayed in 2008 due to the global financial crisis and as of February 2013, onlytwo of the 300 planned islands (\"Greenland\" and \"Lebanon\") have seen development, according to Gulf News.\n\nIn February 2010, images taken from space and posted on NASA\'s Earth Observatory website suggest that the islands of The World are merging and sinking, according to the Daily Mail. The images highlighted fears that the islands would be ultimately eaten away by erosion, as they sat undeveloped, while environmentalists warned rising sea levels would eventually sink the million-dollar islands, reported ABC News.\n\nThe construction of the Oresund Bridge connecting Denmark with Sweden included theconstruction of Peberholm, an artificial island in the Danish side of the Oresund. The island was built to serve as aa crossover point between the tunnel and the bridge.The tunnel had to be built since a bridge spanning the entire link between Malm, Sweden and Copenhagen, Denmark would have interfered with obstacle-free zones around Kastrup Airport. A tunnel would also allow large ships to pass the Oresund without worrying about the height of the bridge.\n\nOfficials built Peberholm with ecology preservation in mind. The location, for example, was chosen since it would ensure the freest flow of water through the sound.Scientists also predicted that nature would colonize the island, without any human interaction (only biologists are allowed beyond the freeway and railway routes). As of June 2007, scientists from the Biological Society of Lund had registered 454 species of plants on the island. The island is also home to8-10 breeding species of birdsand rare spiders, according to Birds-of-Denmark.d, and two important railway lines are at risk.\n\nTheUrospeople ofPeru live on floating islands made from the reed that grow along the edges of LakeTiticaca,Puno. TheUrosharvested the reeds, bundled them together tightly and built floating island platforms. Each island hasa collection of simple, reed housesand the biggest island has a watchtower, according to AtlasObscura. The larger islands house about 10 families, while the smaller ones (about 98 feet wide) house only two or three. According to the Spanish Ministry of Industry, Energy and Tourism\'s report onPuno, theUrosislands sit at 1,246 feet above sea level and are about 3 miles west fromPunoport.\n\nEnvironmental and health issues are affecting the islands and the culture of theUrospeople.\"The waters of theUroshave beenoverfishedby commercial fishermen, tourists are affecting their traditional culture and sewage fromPunois causing environmental and health problems,\"anthropologistArrufoAlcantaraHernandez, director of the faculty of social sciences at the UniversidadNacionaldelAltiplanoinPuno, told National Geographic.\n\nA long, narrow island, in central Vienna, Austria, between the Danube river and the parallel excavated channel Neue Donau (\"New Danube\"), Danube Island (or Donauinsel) is home to clubs, bars and restaurants and a popular music festival. While locals flock to the artificial island to enjoy open-air events, the Danube Island was built as part of Vienna\'s highly sophisticated flood protection system. As the Danube river crosses the city, flooding has long been a concern for Vienna.\n\nConstruction of the island began in early 1970s. Excavation material was dumped between the New Danube and the existing river bed to create 13 miles of artificial island. The flood control system is designed to protect from flash floods bringing river flows of up to 14,000 cubic metersper second. This has only happened once in Vienna\'s history in 1501; the heavy 2002 flood brought flows of 10,000 cubic meters per second.\n\nClose to 2 million trees and bushes were planted between 1974 and 1988.

It stands on an artificial island 920 feet from Jumeirah beach, connected to the mainland with a private curving bridge.To secure a foundation on the island, the builders drove 130-ft long concrete piles into the sand, according to EgyptEng.com. Engineers created a surface layer of large rocks, circled with a concrete honeycomb pattern, which serves to protect the foundation from erosion. Unveiled in 1999, it took three years to reclaim the land from the sea, while it took fewer than three years to construct the building itself, which was designed to resemble the sail of a ship.\n\nThe Burj Al Arab houses some of the most expensive hotel suites in the world -- all suitesare arranged over two floors and have whirlpool baths, living and dining areas and dedicated butlers, according to CNN. One of the suites, the Royal Suite, costs about$18,716 per night.\n\nThe Maldives are known for their stunning natural environments and white beaches, the reason millions of tourists flock to their luxury resorts every year.

It doesn\'t house a five-star hotel, however. Thilafushi was built to serve as a municipal landfill, and was thus nicknamed \"Garbage Island.\"\n\nLocated to the west of Mal, between Kaafu Atoll\'s Giraavaru and Gulhifalhu, Thilafushiis dumping ground for more than 300 tons of rubbish. ?In 2005 it was estimated that31,000 truckloads of garbage are transported to Thilafushiannually, where it is dumped in large piles and eventually used to reclaim land and increase the size of the island, according to the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies.

Up to 50,000 flamingos,a large proportion of the subregion\'s total population,flock to the dam, according to an article in Africa - Birds and Birding. Ornithologist Mark D. Anderson, who oversaw the construction, enlisted the help of a local company Ekapa Mining, who moved 26,000 tons of material to create the island.\n\nUnfortunately, the flamingos are in danger of losing their breeding island.Deteriorating water quality and increasing water levels make Kamfers Dam progressively more unsuitable for Lesser Flamingos, according to GetBirding.com.Not only is the water quality the worst it has ever been, but the water is now at its highest level ever. More than two-thirds of the Lesser Flamingo breeding island remains flooded.\n\nAn uninhabited artificial island in the North Sea, and belonging to the German city of Hamburg, Nigehorn was created in1989 to compensate for ongoing land loss on the nearby island, Scharhrn, which threatened to deprive shorebirds of important breeding grounds.The area created by this large-scale nature protection project was approximately 74 acres but the island has continued to grow naturally with pioneer plants holding airborne sand driven over the island from the surrounding sandbank. Its current surface area is now said to be around 123 acres.\n\nA group of planned man-made islands located in the northeast of Bahrain, near the coast of Muharraq island, the Amwaj Islands cover roughly 30 million square feet.

In addition, Indonesia also has abundant natural resources. However, it has many of Indonesia\'s natural wealth began to run out. Did you know, Indonesia was formerly abundant store of wealth on each island. This is evidenced by the discovery of some relics or ancient sources discovered by historians. Here are seven islands in Indonesia with the natural wealth that was formerly very abundant.\n\nSumatra island was once a gold. This is evident in the writings in an inscription that mentions the island of Sumatra in Sanskrit as Suwarnadwipa which means gold or Suwarnabhumi island which means land of gold. These names had been used in ancient Indian texts. Sumatra is also known as the island of Andalas. However, the number of illegal mining activities create many types of minerals contained in this island began dwindling. Mineral material thinning is like gold, coal and lead.\n\nJava was once famous for JawaDwipa name derived from the Sanskrit word which means rice island. Many experts revealed that Java is ground to the most fertile land in the world. This is evidenced by the many active volcanoes on the island. Causing soil in Java became fertile and good for plant nutrition. Java now supplies about 53% of food needs in Indonesia. Rice farming is much on this island because of the fertile soil. Java also known as Indonesia\'s rice granary. Other crops such as vegetables and fruits are also widely available on the island.\n\nBorneo or Kaliantan is the third largest island in the world. In the past, the island is referred to as Warunadwipa which means island of the sea god. Javanese people used to also refer to the island as Nusa Kencana and the Malays call Hujung island nation\'s Land and the British and Dutch colonial refer to as Borneo. Previously foreign nations who come to this island to trade with the Dayak form of camphor, candles and bird nest that is exchanged with ceramic jars that have high sales value. On this island there are also gold and diamonds were found by the Malays and Chinese merchants at that time. Now the island of Borneo to be one of the largest energy in Indonesia. Energy resources are managed as coal, petroleum, natural gas and geothermal. In Kalimantan was also found uranium.\n\nThe island has been inhabited by humans since 30.00 years. Evidenced by ancient relics at the site of prehistoric stone age Besoa Valley. In the Dutch colonial era, the Dutch called this island as Celebes. This island has long ago become the largest producer of iron. This is evident in the area around the lake Matana Ussu and contains iron and nickel. In Sulawesi Luwu empire once stood. Many communities became producer of iron named Bessi Luwu Luwu in the form of a dagger or a very famous kawali efficacy. Now the island of Sulawesi is still rich in natural materials such as iron, copper, silver, gold, nickel, iron sand / black, titanium, sulfur, and cement as well as many minerals such as rock, trass, sand and gravel.\n\nThe islands consists of Bali, NTB and NTT. The archipelago is famous for its stunning natural attractions. Now the area become a tourist destination.\n\nThe original name of the island of Maluku is Jazirah al-Mulk which means royal collection which consists of small kingdoms. The island is known as the thousand islands region and cultural diversity as well as abundant natural resources. Dutch people call this island as three gold from the eastern Banda, Ambon and Ternate. While the Portuguese nation calls Ambon, Ternate and Banda with the Spices Island. Maluku is spice in the world.

If you superimpose a map of Indonesia over one of Europe, you will find that it stretches from Ireland to Iran; compared to the United States, it covers the area from California to Bermuda. There are eight major islands or island groups in this enormous chain. The largest landmasses consist of Sumatra, Java, Kalimantan (Borneo), Sulawesi (Celebes) and Irian Jaya (the western half of Papua New Guinea). The smaller islands fall into two main groups: the Molluccas to the northeast, and the lesser Sunda chain east of Bali. Bali is a unique island, which for a number of reasons can be put into a class of its own. Mountain lovers will find plenty to enjoy in Indonesia. A great volcano chain, the Bukit Barisan, runs the entire length of Sumatra. On the West Coast, the mountains fall abruptly to the sea, while to the east they ease gradually down to plains in a broad fringe of coastal mangroves. Vegetation-clad volcanoes also rise dramatically from the sea at Banda, Ternate and Makian. Many of the volcanoes are still active, constantly smouldering and occasionally erupting violently, though geological stations monitor the active ones constantly and give warning if they are unsafe to climb. Mount Merapi in Central Java is a favourite for climbers, despite being one of the most active on the archipelago. Mountain lakes are also abundant in dormant craters of many volcanoes, the most famous of these being lake Toba in the northern highlands of Sumatra. This mountain lake covers an area four times the size of Singapore. In Kalimantan, waterborne transportation moves cargo and passengers up and down the major rivers: Mahakam, Barito, Kahayan and Kapuas. The mountainous island of Flores is famous for its multi-coloured volcanic lakes, known as Keli Mutu. The three lakes are in a close group and range from dark red to turquoise. Located between two distinct bio-geographic groups - Asia and Australia - the flora and fauna of the archipelago is also quite idiosyncratic. Species found nowhere else on earth have flourished in certain areas, including the famous Komodo dragon on the island of the same name. Also in abundance are rare flowers, including exotic orchids, unusual insects, birds of paradise and numerous indigenous spices such as cloves, nutmeg cinnamon, mace and many more.\n\n \n\n \n\n','2017-03-25 03:51:12'),(92,14,'0dbca87703c0eb5141bf15c79fa7f168ea76ba8ff19dd897dc4c5d7c79faf6a8','60ce8c1873dd427a9f82766f2e5c8298','','','The new Sweety con Nutella, unveiled yesterday on the McDonalds Italy Facebook page, isnt a savory burger at all, and therefore has no thawed meat puck or processed cheese contaminating its soft, hopefully still warm roll.

But who cares?\n\nWith the exception of Oprah Winfreybacking Barack Obama in the 2008 Democratic primary, celebrity endorsements have never been proven to have moved many voters in past elections.\n\nAnd, despitethis being the most unprecedented presidential campaign in American history, thetraditional \"celebgap\"  Democrats typically boastHollywood endorsements in better quantity and qualitythan Republicansremainsobvious,albeit more gapingthan ever before.\n\nBut so far in 2016,it hasn\'t mattered, maybe becausethe candidates, Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, are major celebs themselves.\n\nSo why do candidates still chase celebrity endorsements? Because such big names can help with fundraising and because they might influence certain voting blocks, such as Millennials glued to their social mediaaccounts, say political and pop-culture experts.\n\n\"If a celebrity they look up to is online slamming a candidate, that\'s going to leavean impression,\" says Bre Payton, 24, who covers culture and Millennial politics for the conservative/libertarianmagazineThe Federalist. \"WhenChrissy Teigen gets into Twitter fights with Trump, pointing out how ridiculous his ideas are, that definitelyleaves an impression on young voters; they may not be so likely to vote for someone as a result.\"\n\nTrump, the most famous Hollywoodentertainer-turned-presidential candidate since Ronald Reagan in 1980, could plausibly boasthe\'s a bigger starthan any celeb who might endorse him.\n\nThe few who have endorsed Trump mostly inhabit the C- list: rocker Ted Nugent, wrestler Hulk Hogan, Duck Dynasty\'s Phil Robertson, Vegas crooner Wayne Newton. They tend to get more attention for their Trump love than arguably bigger stars like country queen Loretta Lynn, Cheers star Kirstie Alley and Oscar winner Jon Voight.\n\nTrump \"doesnt need anybody, and why would he? He\'s the most egotistical candidate we\'ve ever seen, why would he want anybody showing him up?\" says David Schneiderman, a founder/owner of Hollywood trailer-maker Seismic Productions and a fundraiser for Clinton.\n\nMeanwhile, DemocratClinton, one of the most famous women in the world, boasts Katy Perry, Reese Witherspoon and Lena Dunham among her supporters..\n\nTuesday, Leonardo DiCaprio was to co-host a starry fundraiser for Clinton in Los Angeles but had to bowout due to aschedule change.ButJustin Timberlake and wife Jessica Biel will fill in for him, along with other Hollywood co-hosts, including Jennifer Aniston, Tobey Maguire and Shonda Rhimes.\n\nAnd yet, according to polls, Clinton remainsone ofthe most distrusted and dislikedDemocratic presidential nominees in years.A Washington Post/ABC pollAug. 1-4found that 50% of those polled had anunfavorable view of her (compared with a63% unfavorability rating for Trump), while 59% do not consider her honest and trustworthy (compared with 62% for Trump).\n\nTrump\'s main A-list endorsement so far isClint Eastwood  a surprisingly tepid Eastwood.The Oscar-winning actor and director said in an interview withEsquirethis month that if he had to pick between Clinton and Trump, Id have to go for Trump.\"\n\nTalk about damning with faint praise.But why should Trumpcare?He\'s gotten this far without the A-list.\n\nTrump promised a showbiz-style Republican National Convention last month, but it wasn\'t. The two big celebs on hisstage were Scott Baio, a sitcom actor who hasn\'t been on TV in decades, and soap actor Antonio Sabato Jr., betterknown as a former underwear model.\n\nThe Democratic National Convention had celebs to spare: Perry sang. Elizabeth Banks mocked. Dunham and America Ferrera declared Trump is\"making America hate again.\" Meryl Streep dressed in a Stars-and-Stripes dress and let out a primal scream for Clinton. Bernie Sanders arrivedwith a strong and passionate stable of A-list endorsers but, by the end, led by comedianand Sanders supporter Sarah Silverman, most of them were embracing Clinton.\n\n\"Trumpembarrassed himself with the level of celebs,\" says veteran Hollywood publicist Howard Bragman,founder of Fifteen Minutes PR. \"The Democrats\' convention, you could have watched it as a variety show.\"\n\nAs everyone knows, Hollywood leans liberal Democrat, so Trump\'s lack of celebrity luster (other than his own) isn\'t surprising, says journalism professor Mark Feldstein of the University ofMaryland. Trump\'s problem is that the more he campaigns and the more he talks, the less likely he is to acquire Hollywood fans, Feldstein says.\n\n\"Trump has become such a stigma, he doesnt even have the support of a traditional GOP candidate,\" Feldstein says. \"Clinton isn\'t coolbut Trump is so radioactive in most of Hollywood, by default she gets the support of a traditional liberal bastion, if she keeps her head.\"\n\nBesides, she\'s been working Hollywood for decades. What makes Trump\'s campaign different is that he isn\'t trying that hard. And he says he doesn\'t need to raise money from Hollywood donors.\n\n\"Trump is not trying to cultivate celebritiesto be at his side,\" says presidential historian Douglas Brinkley of Rice University in Texas.\"He is the top of the celebrity food chain, he doesnt need an entourage. He\'s able to carry that mountain himself, particularly on Twitter, where hes in command of his brand every day.\"\n\nTrump haseven discouraged some of his boldfacedfriendsTom Brady, for instance from publiclyendorsing him in case it interferes with their careers or commercial affiliations.\n\n\"If Trump is already playing this like his celebrity-based reality program, doesn\'t whoever he brings out end up being redundant?\" asks Robert Thompson, a professor and director of theBleier Center for Television & Popular Cultureat Syracuse University. \"Why does he needstar power whenhe presented this (campaign)as a one-man show?\"\n\nThompson saysmost votersfeel strongly about their political leanings; it\'s part of their identity andmore powerful than how they may feel about a popular celebrity.\n\n\"You\'re not going to go over to the other side just because you like Clint Eastwood so much,\" Thompson says.\n\nLooked at scientifically, the value of celeb endorsements is usually more ephemeral than factual, with one recent exception: the Oprah-for-Obama endorsement during the 2007-08 primary campaign against Clinton. According to CraigGarthwaite, who co-wrote astudyof the endorsementwhen he was at the University of Maryland (he\'s now anassistant professor at the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University), Winfrey was responsible for moving about 1 million votes to Obama in his quest for the Democratic nomination. (This year, WinfreyendorsedClinton.)\n\nGarthwaite says his research showed Winfreywas effective because she was a celebrity of \"nearly unparalleled popularity\" at the time whoinfluenced her fan base(white women) to vote for Obama over a white female candidate with similar policy positions. Winfreyincreased Obama\'s share of the vote in the primary, increased his campaign donations and increased overall voter participation, he says.\n\n\"I would be surprised if celebrity endorsements were afactor (in 2016) because we dont have celebrities (likeOprah)with 8 million tuning in to a daily talk show and a provenability to move products, and because the mediais more fragmented now,\" Garthwaite says.\n\nThe real value of a celeb endorsement these days may be financial, if the celeb is seen as politically savvy and authentic, says Schneiderman.\n\n\"We live in a celebrity culture and knowing that a celebrity is attached or on board helps with raising money,\" he says. \"But it has to be the right celebrity.People like LeonardoDiCaprio is a perfect example: Heputs hismoney where his mouth is, he researches causes, he has organizations he\'s created.

In response, the Vishwa Hindu Parishad on Saturday asked Hindus to have more children to rectify this \"demographic imbalance\" and predicted that soon Muslims will overtake the number of Hindus in India.\n\nThis is nothing new, of course. Malthusian fears of a Muslim takeover of India have been a core part of the Hindutva agenda for almost a century now. After the 2002 Gujarat pogrom, for example, Narendra Modi characterised the violence-affected Muslims in riot camps as baby-producing factories.\n\nAfter he formed the government at the Centre, these fears have come to the fore in the form of pronouncements by various Bharatiya Janata Party leaders who want Hindu women to have greater numbers of children in order to boost the communitys numbers.\n\nIn January, just before the Delhi assembly elections, the 2011 Census figures on religion were conveniently leaked to newspapers.\n\nUnfortunately, these feverish demographic projections generate far more heat than light. As the charts below show, actual data on this issue would hardly support the sort of fears that the Sangh Parivar plays up.\n\nThis is an extremely popular notion in the Sangh Parivar. Before the Vishwa Hindu Parishad\'s statement on Saturday, this was last bought up in February by the Bharatiya Janata Partys Sadhvi Prachi, who accused Muslims of giving birth to 40 dogs each and trying to convert Hindustan into Darul Islam.\n\nDrumming up of fears of a minority swamping a majority is standard right wing political strategy and it is no different in India.\n\nIndeed, Muslim population growth rates are higher than the corresponding figure for the Hindu community. If one were to accepted that the leaked figures from the 2011 Census are accurate, Hindus grew at an average annual rate of 1.4% between 2001 and 2011. For Muslims, the corresponding figure was 2.2%.\n\nIf we assume both communities continue to grow at this rate, Muslims will catch up with Hindus by 2220  in around 200 years.\n\nAccepting these growth rates, at the time Muslims outnumber Hindus, Indias population will be 3,264 crore. Now you know that is a lot of people but lets see just how much.\n\nAt these rates, for Muslims to overtake Hindus, Indias population would need to be almost five times the current global population. In other words, this is clearly an impossible scenario.\n\nMore logically, at some point in the future, Muslim growth rates will slow down and the population will stabilise. This, in fact, is already happening. While from 1991 to 2001, the Indian Muslim population grew by 29.3%, in the period 2001-2011, it grew by 24.4%  a fall, therefore, of almost 5 percentage points.\n\nThe Sachar Committee Report, taking this falling growth rate into account, has estimated that the Muslim proportion will stabilise at between 17% and 21% of the Indian population by 2100. A far cry from some of the doomsday scenarios being painted.\n\nThe extremely poor economic conditions of Muslims in India are cited by many liberals and left wingers as the prime reason for their high population growth rate. However, the Hindutva explanation for this growth, expectedly, blames religious factors and dismisses the economic drivers.\n\nTo quote Hindutva Indologist, Koenraad Elst: Muslims will have a markedly higher birth rate than their Hindu counterparts, even to the extent of having a higher birth rate than Hindus in a lower educational or income bracket.\n\nAs this chart below shows, depending on how you segment the data, a number of other disadvantaged population groups have growth rates similar to the Muslim growth rate.\n\nMoreover, since Muslim infant mortality is lower than other population segments, this effect can even be seen in the Total Fertility Rate (or number of births per woman).\n\nThe Muslim Total Fertility Rate is, as expected, higher than that for Hindus and Christian. But when we segment the population socio-economically, we see that Muslims manage to be better off than people without any education or the poorest fifth of Indias population by wealth.\n\nClearly then, economic and educational factors seem to the major driver at play here.\n\nWe could also disprove the Hindutva groups religious argument by looking at the global scene. Iran, for example, achieved replacement level fertility (with each new generation being less populous than the one before) in 2002, a goal India will only reach in 2020. With a population that is more than 90% Muslim, Bangladesh has a TFR not only lower than Indias overall but also lower than Indias Hindus.\n\nAccusations of large-scale Bangladeshi immigration are a hot-button issue for the right wing now, another supposed driver of the alleged Muslim population boom, along with polygamy (which in itself is untrue). So critical, in fact, that Modi thought that the Assam government was culling rhinos in order to make way for immigrants.\n\nIf, as alleged, such large-scale immigration was taking place from Bangladesh to Assam and West Bengal, the Muslim population in those two states would tend to show abnormal growth. But the data shows nothing of that sort.\n\nAssams Muslim population, for example, grew at the same rate as Indias Muslim population between 1991 and 2001 and West Bengals Muslim population, in fact, grew slower. The abnormal growth rate that Assams and West Bengals Muslim populations should show, given the alleged massive Bangladeshi immigration, simply has not happened.\n\nIn the rough and tumble of Indias politics, religious rhetoric often goes a long way electorally. It is therefore not surprising that, in spite of the mountains of contrary data, the Sangh Parivar\'s demographic scaremongering has managed to achieve a significant amount of traction.\n\nThis article was originally published on Scroll.in and has been reproduced with permission.','2017-03-25 03:51:12'),(112,16,'0f2a73e52abe0c0a4c7b96cdd34e894078d18fd051f1b24e3310114cd94c3f89','2bc932332bc14179b07c6f2c1715cb43','','','semi-democratic governance has not reversed its long-held reputation as one of world\'s largest producers of illicit drugs','2017-03-25 03:51:12'),(113,16,'0f2a73e52abe0c0a4c7b96cdd34e894078d18fd051f1b24e3310114cd94c3f89','fada5a3d18d04694b56f107e7b4d7754','','','In late November, Indonesian social-media activist Ulin Yusron found himself depicted in a meme. The image, which went viral, falsely portrayed the long-haired male journalist as Amalia Ayuningtyas  a female election volunteer for the governor of Jakarta. The photo, the text claimed, was of Amalia immodestly casting off her usual hijab. It asked: Wheres the Veil??\n\nJakarta\'s Christian and ethnically Chinese governor  Basuki Tjahaja Purnama, popularly known as Ahok  is a target for hard-line Muslims, who have successfully pressured the authorities to put him on trial for blasphemy . It is not surprising that memes are being produced that seek to depict the Muslim volunteers in his camp as irreligious and profane.\n\nWhen I first saw it, I was able to laugh, Ulin tells TIME about the photo collage. But later on, it became so troublesome because there were people who believed it  [The meme] was around for quite a while, and I became tired of explaining it.\n\nHoaxes like this, and fake news items in general, have become a massive problem in Indonesia in recent months, coinciding with the hotly contested Jakarta gubernatorial election campaign. To be sure, the sharing of fake news on social media has contributed to political tension in many countries  by one estimate, it generated more social-media engagement than real news during the U.S. presidential election in November  but in Indonesia, with its recent incidences of domestic terrorism, and its long and bloody history of anticommunist, anti-Christian and anti-Chinese pogroms, inflaming ethnic and political tensions is potentially deadly.\n\nPresident Joko Jokowi Widodo, seen as a Muslim moderate, has vowed to crack down, telling a Cabinet meeting that fake news was nothing short of an attempt to destabilize his government. Slander, hatred and rude words on social media are increasingly troubling people, Jokowi tweeted on Dec. 29. We need determined and tough law enforcement.\n\nThe problem first drew significant attention during Indonesia\'s 2014 presidential election, in which Jokowi  Ahok\'s predecessor as Jakarta\'s top official  was a candidate. During electioneering, Jokowi was the constant target of a smear campaign that falsely claimed he was, among other things, the child of Indonesian Communist Party members, of Chinese descent, and a Christian. (He was forced to make his marriage certificate public to quell the rumors.)\n\nNow, the creators of fake news are targeting Ahok, who was deputy governor of Indonesia\'s sprawling capital under Jokowi. Ahok succeeded his boss in the governorship and, backed by Jokowis party, is now seeking his own mandate in the gubernatorial election next year, competing with two other rivals, including former President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono\'s son. Ahok\'s candidacy is opposed by hard-liners who, insisting that Indonesia\'s top jobs be filled Muslims only, want to quash any chances Ahok may have of following Jokowi into the national arena.\n\nAn edited video and transcript of a campaign speech Ahok made in September, uploaded onto Facebook, went viral and led to ultra-conservative Muslims accusing him of denigrating the Quran. (Ahok suggested in the speech that hard-liners who cited a Quranic verse to support their position that non-Muslims shouldn\'t hold high office were misleading voters. His exact words were: Ladies and gentlemen, you dont have to vote for me  because youve been lied to by those using [the Qurans] Surah al-Maidah verse 51.)\n\nThree massive demonstrations resulted, bringing tens of thousands of people to the streets of Jakarta, demanding that Ahok be jailed. He was subsequently put in the dock .\n\nAhok\'s Chinese ethnicity is the target of much of Indonesia\'s false news  highly disturbing in a country where tens of thousands of Chinese have lost their lives in pogroms dating back to Dutch colonial rule. There are false rumors of 10 million mainland Chinese workers swamping Indonesia (which Jokowi has rebuffed, saying that 10 million is the number of Chinese tourists we hope will come). Others claim that the design of Indonesias new monetary notes resembles Chinese currency  or that Ahoks free HPV vaccine program could make girls infertile, and is, therefore, part of a Chinese conspiracy to diminish the Indonesian population. Hoaxers also claimed that the commander of the armed forces, General Gatot Nurmantyo, has warned that communist China has started to meddle in this country. Both the Indonesian military and the general have denied he ever made such a statement.\n\nAt the same time, Anti-Chinese sentiment isnt independent of its own. It is part of a larger network, says the social-media activist Ulin, who is a supporter of Ahok. He says that fake news is also whipping up anticommunist and anti-Shiite feelings. All of this is to heighten anti-Ahok sentiment while at the same time de-legitimizing Jokowi.\n\nHoax news has been a daily phenomenon in Indonesia, says Titi Anggraini, executive director of the Association for Elections and Democracy, a Jakarta-based elections watchdog that is also known as Perludem in Indonesian. But, the spread of hoax news intensified during the 2014 presidential election and is intensifying in [the run-up to] the 2017 Jakarta gubernatorial election.\n\nThe government, watchdog groups and even religious organizations have taken steps to stem its spread. The Communications Ministry on Wednesday blocked 11 websites, mostly for spreading hatred and misinformation, following a similar step in November. Fact-check sites, apps and Facebook pages, run by activists and volunteers, have sprung up to set the record straight. Nahdlatul Ulama, the biggest Islamic mass organization in Indonesia, has kicked off an anti-fake-news campaign called #TurnBackHoax, while Muhammadiyah, the second biggest Islamic organization, has declared that spreading hoax news is tantamount to a sin. The Press Council has also said it will be verifying trusted media outlets.\n\nSuch actions are important to make things right and to teach a lesson to offenders, Titi tells TIME. But, she adds, The legal process, especially criminal punishment, is really ultimum remidium [the last resort]  and calls for digital literacy education. She also wants guarantees that law enforcement will respect freedom of expression. But that is no easy balance to strike in Indonesia\'s tense political atmosphere.','2017-03-25 03:51:12'),(114,16,'0f2a73e52abe0c0a4c7b96cdd34e894078d18fd051f1b24e3310114cd94c3f89','3fbb124820a84b179714de3d4e81f17b','','','The history of Islam in Japan is relatively brief in relation to the religion\'s longstanding presence in other nearby countries. Islam is one of the smallest minority faiths in Japan, having more adherents in the country than the Bah\' faith, but fewer than Christianity. There were isolated occasions of Muslims in Japan before the 19th century. Japan\'s Muslim population is around 70,000 which includes less than 10,000 of them as Japanese and the rest being foreigners (Majority of them are nationals from Southeast Asian countries).[1]\n\nThere are isolated records of contact between Islam and Japan before the opening of the country in 1853, possibly as early as the 1700s; some Muslims did arrive in earlier centuries, although these were isolated incidents.\n\nThe earliest Western records of Japan can be found in the works of the Muslim cartographer Ibn Khordadbeh, who clearly mentions Japan as the \"lands of Waqwaq\" twice: East of China are the lands of Waqwaq, which are so rich in gold that the inhabitants make the chains for their dogs and the collars for their monkeys of this metal. They manufacture tunics woven with gold. Excellent ebony wood is found there. And: Gold and ebony are exported from Waqwaq.[2] Mahmud Kashgari\'s 11th century atlas indicates the land routes of the Silk Road and Japan in the map\'s easternmost extent.\n\nWithin Kublai\'s court, his most trusted governors and advisers appointed by meritocracy with the essence of multiculturalism were: Semu, Hui, Koreans and Chinese.[3][4] Because the Wokou extended support to the crumbling Song dynasty, Kublai Khan initiated the Mongol invasions of Japan.\n\nThe court of the Goryeo supplied Korean troops and an ocean-going naval force for the Mongol campaigns. Despite the opposition of some of his Confucian-trained advisers, Kublai decided to invade Japan, Burma, Vietnam, and Java, following the suggestions of some of his Mongol officials. He also attempted to subjugate peripheral lands such as Sakhalin, where its indigenous people eventually submitted to the Mongols by 1308, after Kublai\'s death.\n\nDuring the 14th century, Hongwu Emperor of the Ming dynasty made Ryukyu Kingdom a tributary vassal, and ethnic Chinese settlers consolidated the islands for their ruler in Nanjing.\n\nDuring that period there was contact between the Hui, general Lan Yu of the Ming dynasty and the swordsmiths of Japan. According to Chinese sources, Lan Yu owned 10,000 Katana, Hongwu Emperor was displeased with the general\'s links with Kyoto and more than 15,000 people were implicated for alleged treason and executed.[5][6]\n\nEarly European accounts of Muslims and their contacts with Japan were maintained by Portuguese sailors who mention a passenger aboard their ship, an Arab who had preached Islam to the people of Japan. He had sailed to the islands in Malacca in 1555.[7][8]\n\nThe first modern[clarification needed] Muslim contacts[clarification needed] were with Indonesians who served aboard British and Dutch ships in the late 19th century.[citation needed]\n\nIn the late 1870s, the biography of Muhammad was translated into Japanese. This helped Islam spread and reach the Japanese people, but only as a part of the history of cultures.[citation needed]\n\nAnother important contact was made in 1890 when the Ottoman Empire dispatched a naval vessel to Japan for the purpose of saluting the visit of Japanese Prince Komatsu Akihito to Constantinople several years earlier. This frigate was called the Ertugrul, and was destroyed in a storm along the coast of Wakayama Prefecture on September 16, 1890.[citation needed]\n\nThe first Japanese to go on the Hajj was Kotaro Yamaoka. He converted to Islam in 1909 in Bombay, after coming into contact with Russian-born writer, Abdrreid brahim, whereupon he took the name Omar Yamaoka. Both were traveling with the support of nationalistic Japanese groups like the Black Dragon Society (Kokurykai), Yamaoka in fact had been with the intelligence service in Manchuria since the Russo-Japanese war. His official reason for travelling was to seek the Sultan\'s approval for building a mosque in Tokyo. This approval was granted in 1910, and the mosque was completed in 1938. Another early Japanese convert was Bunpachiro Ariga, who about the same time went to India for trading purposes and converted to Islam under the influence of local Muslims there, and subsequently took the name Ahmed Ariga. Yamada Toajiro was from 1892 for almost twenty years the only resident Japanese trader in Constantinople.[9] During this time he served unofficially as consul. He converted to Islam, and took the name Abdul Khalil, and made a pilgrimage to Mecca on his way home.\n\nThe real Muslim community life however did not start until the arrival of several hundred Turko-Tatar Muslim refugees from Central Asia and Russia in the wake of the October Revolution. These Muslims, who were given asylum in Japan, settled in several main cities and formed small communities. They are estimated at less than 600 in 1938 for Japan proper, a few thousand on the continent. Some Japanese converted to Islam through contact with these Muslims.\n\nThe Kobe Mosque was built in 1935 with the support of the Turko-Tatar community of traders there. The Tokyo Mosque, planned since 1908 was finally completed in 1938, with generous financial support from the zaibatsu. Its first imams were Abdrreid brahim (18571944), who had returned in 1938, and Abdulhay Qorbangali (18891972).\n\nThe Ahmadiyya Muslim Community was established in 1935 in Japan.[10]\n\nIn the late Meiji period, close relations were forged between Japanese military elites with an Asianist agenda and Muslims to find a common cause with those suffering under the yoke of Western hegemony.[11] In 1906, widespread campaigns were aimed at Muslims nations with journals reporting that a Congress of religions was to be held in Japan where the Japanese would seriously consider adopting Islam as the national religion and that the Emperor was at the point of becoming a Muslim.[12]\n\nNationalistic organizations like the Ajia Gikai were instrumental in petitioning the Japanese government on matters such as officially recognizing Islam, along with Shintoism, Christianity and Buddhism as a religion in Japan, and in providing funding and training to Muslim resistance movements in Southeast Asia, such as the Hizbullah, a resistance group funded by Japan in the Dutch Indies. The Greater Japan Muslim League (, Dai Nihon Kaiky Kykai?) founded in 1930, was the first official Islamic organisation in Japan. It had the support of imperialistic circles during World War II, and caused an \"Islamic Studies Boom\".[13] During this period, over 100 books and journals on Islam were published in Japan. While these organizations had their primary aim in intellectually equipping Japan\'s forces and intellectuals with better knowledge and understanding of the Islamic world, dismissing them as mere attempts to further Japan\'s aims for a \"Greater Asia\" does not reflect the nature of depth of these studies. Japanese and Muslim academia in their common aims of defeating Western colonialism had been forging ties since the early twentieth century, and with the destruction of the last remaining Muslim power, the Ottoman Empire, the advent of hostilities in World War II and the possibility of the same fate awaiting Japan, these academic and political exchanges and the alliances created reached a head. Therefore, they were extremely active in forging links with academia and Muslim leaders and revolutionaries, many of whom were invited to Japan.\n\nShmei kawa, by far the highest-placed and most prominent figure in both Japanese government and academia in the matter of Japanese-Islamic exchange and studies, managed to complete his translation of the Qur\'an in prison, while being prosecuted as an alleged class-A war criminal by the victorious Allied forces for being an \'organ of propaganda\'.[14] Charges were dropped for his erratic behaviour officially; however historians have speculated that the weakness of the charges against him was more likely the true reason. While Okawa did display unusual behaviour during the trial such as rapping on the head of Hideki Tj, he also stated that the trial was a farce and unworthy of being called one.[citation needed] He was transferred to a hospital on official claims of mental instability and then prison, and freed not long thereafter, dying a Muslim in 1957 after a quiet life where he continued lecturing, on his return to his home village and his wife, who survived him. He claimed to have seen visions of Muhammad in his sleep.[citation needed]\n\nIn the 1970s, another \"Islamic Boom\" occurred, this time due to the \"Arab Boom\" after the 1973 oil crisis. After realizing the importance of the Middle East and its massive oil reserves for the Japanese economy, the Japanese mass media have since been giving big publicity to the Muslim World in general and the Arab World in particular.[citation needed]\n\nThe Turks have been the biggest Muslim community in Japan until recently.\n\nThe Japanese invasion of China and South East Asian regions during the Second World War brought the Japanese in contact with Muslims. Those who converted to Islam through them returned to Japan and established in 1953, the first Japanese Muslim organisation, the Japan Muslim Association under the leadership of Sadiq Imaizumi.\n\nThe second president of the association was the Umar Mita, who was typical of the old generation, learning Islam in the territories occupied by the Japanese Empire. He was working for the Manshu Railway Company, which virtually controlled the Japanese territory in the northeastern province of China at that time. Through his contacts with Chinese Muslims, he became a Muslim in Peking. When he returned to Japan after the war, he made the Hajj, the first Japanese in the post-war period to do so. He also made a Japanese translation of the Qur\'an from a Muslim perspective for the first time. Aljazeera also made a documentary regarding Islam and Japan called \"Road to Hajj  Japan\".[15]\n\nThough many Islamic organisations were established since the 1900s, each of them had only very few active members.[citation needed]\n\nThe Muslim community in Japan has a history of over 100 years, although some sources disagree.[16][17][18] Historian Caeser E. Farah documented that in 1909 Abdul-Rashid Ibrahim was the first Muslim who successfully converted the first ethnic Japanese, and in 1935 Kobe MosqueJapan\'s first Islamic buildingwas constructed.[16][19] On 12 May 1938, a Mosque was dedicated in Tokyo.[20]\n\nIn 1941, one of the chief sponsers of the Tokyo Mosque asserted that the number of Muslims in Japan numbered 600, with just three or four being native Japanese.[20] Some sources state that in 1982 the Muslims numbered 30,000 (half were natives).[16] Some ethnic Japanese women during the economic boom of the 1980s converted when large numbers of immigrants from Asia came and mixed with the local population.[21] Most estimates of the Muslim population have been around 100,000 total.[16][22][23] Islam remains a minority religion in Japan, and there is no evidence as to whether its numbers are increasing. Conversion is more prominent among young ethnic Japanese married women, as claimed by the The Modern Religion as early as the 1990s.[21] The true size of the Muslim population in Japan remains a matter of speculation. Some Muslim organizations and media reports have put the number of Muslims in Japan at up to 100,000. The most serious work on this question has been done by Japanese scholars such as Hiroshi Kojima of the National Institute of Population and Social Security Research and Keiko Sakurai of Waseda University. Their estimates suggest a Muslim population of around 70,000, of which perhaps 90% are resident foreigners and about 10% native Japanese.[17][22]\n\nAccording to japanfocus.org, as of 2009 there were 30 to 40 single-story mosques in Japan plus another 100 or more apartment rooms set aside for prayers in the absence of more suitable facilities. 90% of these mosques use the 2nd floor for religious activities and the first floor as a halal shop (Imported food; mainly from Indonesia and Malaysia), due to financial problems, as membership is too low to cover up the expenses. most of these Mosques have only a capacity of 30 to 50 people.

Apparently there was a bit of a push for metric in the 1970s; the 1975 Metric Conversion Act declared the metric system the preferred system for trade and commerce. Unfortunately, switching was voluntary and such was the publics aversion that the Metric Conversion Board was disbanded in 1982. You hear some metric measurements bandied about, for example by runners doing 5ks, 10ks and so on, or people buying liter bottles of soda. There is actually a U.S. Metric Association that has existed since 1916, and even an annual National Metric Week (October 5-11). So come on America!

Heck, even if I did have time, the tax is rarely a handy five or 10 percent. I understand that sales tax is different all over the country (and sometimes non-existent), but so what? If stores can change their prices when they run sales (which arent always national), surely they can let us know how much they really want from us.\n\nWhy isnt the World Series a global affair? \n\n Ive heard some cracking answers to this one in my time.

Alas, this is an old sporting legend, a fact confirmed by Freddie Berowski, a research associate at the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum in Cooperstown, N.Y. Heres a more detailed history of the evolution of the name.\n\nWhy are Jeopardy answers in the form of questions? \n\n It always strikes me as weird that contestants must say what is before giving their answers. Surely, its stressful enough on Jeopardy without having to remember to phrase your answer as a question. A little research, however, unearths the story of the games origin; it was also initially named Whats the Question?, which makes things a little clearer.\n\nWhy can U.S. kids drive, vote, get married and die for their country by age 18, yet not buy a six-pack until theyre 21?\n\n It comes as quite the shock to visiting 20-year-olds that they cant go out for a pint here when theyve been doing so in their own country for two years.\n\nThe historical explanation is that in 1984 the National Minimum Drinking Age Act was introduced as one of many efforts to curb drink driving.

However, popular as this explanation may be, its not actually true and although the newspaper did report the results of the games, it had nothing to do with the naming of the competition.\n\nThe real reason behind the name is thanks to Barney Dreyfuss who was the owner of the Pittsburgh Pirates. In 1903, he wrote to the owner of the Boston Red Sox challenging them to a Worlds Championship Series. The Pirates were the best team in the National League and the Red Sox were the best in the American League.\n\nThe games went ahead and Boston won the series five games to three. Over time, the \'Worlds Championship Series\' name has been shortened to the World Series and has been played every year apart from 1904 and 1994.\n\nMany Americans consider the World Series as being the world championship of baseball. They base this on the fact that generally the worlds best baseball players play in Major League baseball. This makes it the strongest league in the world consisting of players from over 20 countries.\n\nHowever, the winners of the World Series arent in any way world champions as this title is reserved for the winners of the World Baseball Classic, which is an international tournament started in 2006. The winning teams of the competitions so far are as follows:\n\nThe World Series may only be a North American event but there is no doubt that it is the worlds premier baseball event. Whilst it may not feature teams from across the globe, it does feature many international players. For these reasons, we can justify the World Series as its name.','2017-03-25 03:51:12'),(119,17,'132e965bbd6ca0d90a7a759ec22c4764e9e3ad9b8e908993f7214fb12aa26bdf','97fa642368464ea1a16424ec40555db9','','','After setting fire to the trees on Broad St, pelting brawlers with beer bottles, playing the Rocky theme on bugles, looting a luggage store and flipping over a car and a fire engine (or a police car, versions differ, it might have been both), Philadelphia might still be grinning like a Prozac-dosed priapic dolphin with two dicks and a winning lottery ticket, but it\'s pretty much got over its World Series victory, the rapture subsumed into the citywide Obama euphoria and the anticipation - good things coming in threes - that next week it\'s probably going to rain gold.\n\nBut 30-year-old Texan-born interior designer and Philly resident Jaime Walters hasn\'t been entirely happy during this much-vaunted \"best coupla weeks for Philly ever\". The reason? She winces every time she hears the Philadelphia Phillies referred to as world champions or champions of the world. Which happens. Often. I know what she means. It\'s as if every TV and radio station unthinkingly referred to Miley Cyrus as \"the reincarnation of Jimi Hendrix.\" It drives you freaking nuts.\n\n\"They\'re not world champions,\" says Jaime, who says she watches a hell of a lot of baseball for someone who\'s not a baseball fan. \"They haven\'t even played a fair smattering of international teams. They play, what, one Canadian team? I don\'t want to rob Phillies fans of their victory because it\'s fantastic, but Americans calling them world champions is arrogant and ignorant - the two often go together, don\'t they? It\'s just an extension of American bravado and, right now, this isn\'t the time for that. This is the time for a little humility.\"\n\nShe\'s right. Which is why this blog is making a direct appeal to president-elect Obama.\n\nDear Mr President, we - the non-USAian people of the world (and Jaime) know this isn\'t the most urgent issue you\'ll face when you take office in January. We know you\'ve got to close Gitmo, end the war in Iraq, put Dick Cheney on trial and save the global economy and that. But this \"world champions\" stuff - it really gets our goat. That roaring sound you hear? That\'s 6bn foreigners grinding their teeth and groaning. Please make it stop.\n\nYou will hear counterarguments. You will be told the reason the NBA, MLB and NFL champs are called world champions is because all the best teams in those sports are USAian.\n\nThis is codswallop. England has what is considered by many (well, by the English) to be the world\'s best soccer league. But its champions would be laughed at if they claimed to be champions of the world.\n\nYou will be told that nobody plays baseball to the same level as the USAian teams. But the champions of overwhelmingly British sports like conkers or cheese rolling or bog snorkelling make no claim to be world champions based purely on the assumption that no one conkers, bogsnorkels or cheeserolls quite as well as the Brits. And if these, minor, provincial, globally insignificant little sports were to spread to, say, Japan and a handful of economic colonies, and players from those nations competed in a strictly British teams-only championships, nobody would dream of calling the winners world champions.\n\nTo do so would be considered by the rest of the planet to be the very height of unthinking arrogance. And rightly so.\n\nMore importantly, the US does have a team that really have been world champions several times - the women\'s national soccer team. And every time a USAian refers to the winners of a purely national competition as world champions it not only insults these genuine USAian heroines, it diminishes the achievements of all USAians who are real global champions. In short, you\'re pissing on Michael Phelps\' chips, dude. It\'s not cool.\n\nBy lavishing a title on those who haven\'t earned it, you devalue those who have. It\'s kinda like when Bill Clinton was called the first black president.\n\nAnother similar argument for calling the best NBA/NFL/MLB franchise the world champions is the idea that if there were an international competition, a US national team would win easily. But recent and regular humiliations in international basketball, baseball and women\'s softball have proven this to be a fallacy.\n\nThe one and only time the US national team took part in (an admittedly half-assed) baseball world championship, they lost.\n\nThen there\'s the argument that because players from 20 other countries play in MLB, this alone legitimises the world champion label. Players from 83 different countries currently play in the Premier League. But this no more makes Manchester United world champions than you being top dog USAian makes you World King Emperor (despite what your predecessor might have thought).\n\nAnd as for the NFL - no other country plays the sport. No other country (\'cept maybe Canada) has a major American football culture. And thus the arguments used in favour of calling, say, the NBA top team world champions fall flat. You can\'t have it both ways - we\'re world champs because nobody else plays it AND we\'re world champs because we\'ve got some players from other countries. Both arguments are utterly specious and entirely contradictory.\n\nWould you not think it absurd and ridiculous if the Australian Rules football champs called themselves world champions? Given than no other nations play the game? And if Australia were the world\'s dominant economic, cultural and military power - would you not also find it grating, arrogant and offensive? Would you not grimace every time you heard or read it?\n\nOn behalf of every non-USAian on the planet, I can tell you that you would.\n\n(Did you know that England are the European Champions of Australian Rules Football, by the way? No, me neither).\n\nOne last thing: after an extensive email debate on this topic with a USAian friend (a debate that I won, obviously) she emailed back: \"USA is now World Champ of president electing!\"\n\nIn which respect, of course, she is absolutely right.','2017-03-25 03:51:12'),(120,17,'132e965bbd6ca0d90a7a759ec22c4764e9e3ad9b8e908993f7214fb12aa26bdf','804842e92c68428db14e6a59af8032ee','','','Origin of the Name \"World Series\"\n\nCopyright  2001-02 Doug Pappas.

The winner of the World Series championship is determined through a best-of-seven playoff, and the winning team is awarded the Commissioner\'s Trophy.[1] As the series is played in October (and occasionally November), during the autumn season in North America, it is often referred to as the Fall Classic.[2]\n\nPrior to 1969, the team with the best regular season win-loss record in each league automatically advanced to the World Series; since then each league has conducted a championship series (ALCS and NLCS) preceding the World Series to determine which teams will advance. As of 2016, the World Series has been contested 112 times, with the AL winning 64 and the NL winning 48.\n\nThe 2016 World Series took place between the Cleveland Indians and the Chicago Cubs. Seven games were played, with the Cubs victorious after game seven, played in Cleveland. The final score was 87; the game went into extra innings after a tied score of 66. This was the third World Series won by the Cubs, as well as their first title since 1908, a period of 108 years. With the Cubs\' record long title drought finally ended, the Indians\' championship dry spell of 68 years and counting  the Tribe last won the Series in 1948 -- is currently the longest-running Series title absence.\n\nIn the American League, the New York Yankees have played in 40 World Series and won 27, the Philadelphia/Kansas City/Oakland Athletics have played in 14 and won 9, and the Boston Red Sox have played in 12 and won 8, including the first World Series. In the National League, the St. Louis Cardinals have appeared in 19 and won 11, the New York/San Francisco Giants have played in 20 and won 8, the Brooklyn/Los Angeles Dodgers have appeared in 18 and won 6, and the Cincinnati Reds have appeared in 9 and won 5.\n\nAs of 2016, no team has won consecutive World Series championships since the New York Yankees in 1998, 1999, and 2000the longest such drought in Major League Baseball history.\n\nUntil the formation of the American Association in 1882 as a second major league, the National Association of Professional Base Ball Players (18711875) and then the National League (founded 1876) represented the top level of organized baseball in the United States. All championships were awarded to the team with the best record at the end of the season, without a postseason series being played. From 1884 to 1890, the National League and the American Association faced each other in a series of games at the end of the season to determine an overall champion. These series were disorganized in comparison to the modern World Series, with the terms arranged through negotiation of the owners of the championship teams beforehand. The number of games played ranged from as few as three in 1884 (Providence defeated New York three games to zero), to a high of fifteen in 1887 (Detroit beat St. Louis ten games to five). Both the 1885 and 1890 Series ended in ties, each team having won three games with one tie game.[3]\n\nThe series was promoted and referred to as \"The Championship of the United States\",[4][5] \"World\'s Championship Series\", or \"World\'s Series\" for short. In his book Krakatoa: The Day the World Exploded: August 27, 1883, Simon Winchester mentions in passing that the World Series was named for the New York World newspaper,[6] but this view is disputed.[7]\n\nThe 19th-century competitions are, however, not officially recognized as part of World Series history by Major League Baseball, as it considers 19th-century baseball to be a prologue to the modern baseball era.[8] Until about 1960, some sources treated the 19th-century Series on an equal basis with the post-19th-century series.[9] After about 1930, however, many authorities list the start of the World Series in 1903 and discuss the earlier contests separately.[10] (For example, the 1929 World Almanac and Book of Facts lists \"Baseball\'s World Championships 18841928\" in a single table,[11] but the 1943 edition lists \"Baseball World Championships 19031942\".[12])\n\nFollowing the collapse of the American Association after the 1891 season, the National League was again the only major league. The league championship was awarded in 1892 by a playoff between half-season champions. This scheme was abandoned after one season.[13] Beginning in 1893and continuing until divisional play was introduced in 1969the pennant was awarded to the first-place club in the standings at the end of the season. For four seasons, 18941897, the league champions played the runners-up in the post season championship series called the Temple Cup.[14][15] A second attempt at this format was the Chronicle-Telegraph Cup series, which was played only once, in 1900.[16]\n\nIn 1901, the American League was formed as a second major league. No championship series were played in 1901 or 1902 as the National and American Leagues fought each other for business supremacy (in 1902, the top teams instead opted to compete in a football championship).\n\nAfter two years of bitter competition and player raiding (in 1902, the AL and NL champions even went so far as to challenge each other to a tournament in football after the end of the baseball season), the National and American Leagues made peace and, as part of the accord, several pairs of teams squared off for interleague exhibition games after the 1903 season. These series were arranged by the participating clubs, as the 1880s World\'s Series matches had been. One of them matched the two pennant winners, Pittsburg Pirates of the NL and Boston Americans (later known as the Red Sox) of the AL; that one is known as the 1903 World Series. It had been arranged well in advance by the two owners, as both teams were league leaders by large margins.[17] Boston upset Pittsburg by five games to three, winning with pitching depth behind Cy Young and Bill Dinneen and with the support of the band of Royal Rooters. The Series brought much civic pride to Boston and proved the new American League could beat the Nationals.[citation needed]\n\nThe 1904 Series, if it had been held, would have been between the AL\'s Boston Americans (Boston Red Sox) and the NL\'s New York Giants (now the San Francisco Giants). At that point there was no governing body for the World Series nor any requirement that a Series be played. Thus the Giants\' owner, John T. Brush, refused to allow his team to participate in such an event, citing the \"inferiority\" of the upstart American League. John McGraw, the Giants\' manager, even went so far as to say that his Giants were already \"world champions\" since they were the champions of the \"only real major league\". At the time of the announcement, their new cross-town rivals, the New York Highlanders (now the New York Yankees), were leading the AL, and the prospect of facing the Highlanders did not please Giants management. Boston won on the last day of the season, and the leagues had previously agreed to hold a World\'s Championship Series in 1904, but it was not binding, and Brush stuck to his original decision. In addition to political reasons, Brush also factually cited the lack of rules under which money would be split, where games would be played, and how they would be operated and staffed.\n\nDuring the winter of 19041905, however, feeling the sting of press criticism, Brush had a change of heart and proposed what came to be known as the \"Brush Rules\", under which the series were played subsequently. One rule was that player shares would come from a portion of the gate receipts for the first four games only. This was to discourage teams from \"fixing\" early games in order to prolong the series and make more money. Receipts for later games would be split among the two clubs and the National Commission, the governing body for the sport, which was able to cover much of its annual operating expense from World Series revenue. Most importantly, the now-official and compulsory World\'s Series matches were operated strictly by the National Commission itself, not by the participating clubs.\n\nWith the new rules in place and the National Commission in control, McGraw\'s Giants made it to the 1905 Series, and beat the Philadelphia A\'s four games to one. The Series was subsequently held annually, until 1994, when it was canceled due to a players\' strike.\n\nThe list of postseason rules evolved over time. In 1925, Brooklyn owner Charles Ebbets persuaded others to adopt as a permanent rule the 232 pattern used in 1924. Prior to 1924, the pattern had been to alternate by game or to make another arrangement convenient to both clubs. The 232 pattern has been used ever since save for the 1943 and 1945 World Series, which followed a 34 pattern due to World War II travel restrictions; in 1944, the normal pattern was followed because both teams were based in the same home stadium.\n\nGambling and game-fixing had been a problem in professional baseball from the beginning; star pitcher Jim Devlin was banned for life in 1877, when the National League was just two years old. Baseball\'s gambling problems came to a head in 1919, when eight players of the Chicago White Sox were alleged to have conspired to throw the 1919 World Series.\n\nThe Sox had won the Series in 1917 and were heavy favorites to beat the Cincinnati Reds in 1919, but first baseman Chick Gandil had other plans. Gandil, in collaboration with gambler Joseph \"Sport\" Sullivan, approached his teammates and got six of them to agree to throw the Series: starting pitchers Eddie Cicotte and Lefty Williams, shortstop Swede Risberg, left fielder Shoeless Joe Jackson, center fielder Happy Felsch, and utility infielder Fred McMullin. Third baseman Buck Weaver knew of the fix but declined to participate, hitting .324 for the series from 11 hits and committing no errors in the field. The Sox, who were promised $100,000 for cooperating, proceeded to lose the Series in eight games, pitching poorly, hitting poorly and making many errors. Though he took the money, Jackson insisted to his death that he played to the best of his ability in the series (he was the best hitter in the series, including having hit the series\' only home run, but had markedly worse numbers in the games the White Sox lost).\n\nDuring the Series, writer and humorist Ring Lardner had facetiously called the event the \"World\'s Serious\". The Series turned out to indeed have serious consequences for the sport. After rumors circulated for nearly a year, the players were suspended in September 1920.\n\nThe \"Black Sox\" were acquitted in a criminal conspiracy trial. However, baseball in the meantime had established the office of Commissioner in an effort to protect the game\'s integrity, and the first commissioner, Kenesaw Mountain Landis, banned all of the players involved, including Weaver, for life. The White Sox would not win a World Series again until 2005.\n\nThe events of the 1919 Series, segueing into the \"live ball\" era, marked a point in time of change of the fortunes of several teams. The two most prolific World Series winners to date, the New York Yankees and the St. Louis Cardinals, did not win their first championship until the 1920s; and three of the teams that were highly successful prior to 1920 (the Boston Red Sox, Chicago White Sox and the Chicago Cubs) went the rest of the 20th century without another World Series win. The Red Sox and White Sox finally won again in 2004 and 2005, respectively. The Cubs had to wait over a century (until the 2016 season) for their next trophy. They did not appear in the Fall Classic from 1945 until 2016, the longest drought of any MLB club.\n\nThe New York Yankees purchased Babe Ruth from the Boston Red Sox after the 1919 season, appeared in their first World Series two years later in 1921, and became frequent participants thereafter. Over a period of 45 years from 1920 to 1964, the Yankees played in 29 World Series championships, winning 20. The team\'s dynasty reached its apex between 1947 and 1964, when the Yankees reached the World Series 15 times in eighteen years, helped by an agreement with the Kansas City Athletics (after that team moved from Philadelphia during 19541955 offseason) whereby the teams made several deals advantageous to the Yankees (until ended by new Athletics\' owner Charles O. Finley). During that span, the Yankees played in all World Series except 1948, 1954, and 1959, winning ten. From 1949 to 1953, the Yankees won the World Series five years in a row; from 19361939 the Yankees won four World Series Championships in a row. There are only two other occasions when a team has won at least three consecutive World Series: 1972 to 1974 by the Oakland Athletics, and 1998 to 2000 by the New York Yankees.\n\nIn an 18-year span from 1947 to 1964, except for 1948 and 1959, the World Series was played in New York City, featuring at least one of the three teams located in New York at the time. The Dodgers and Giants moved to California after the 1957 season, leaving the Yankees as the lone team in the city until the Mets were enfranchised in 1962. During this period, other than 1948, 1954, and 1959, the Yankees represented the American League in the World Series.\n\nIn the years 1947, 1949, 19511953, and 19551956, both teams in the World Series were from New York, with the Yankees playing against either the Dodgers or Giants.\n\nIn 1958, the Brooklyn Dodgers and New York Giants took their long-time rivalry to the west coast, moving to Los Angeles and San Francisco, respectively, bringing Major League Baseball west of St. Louis and Kansas City.\n\nThe Dodgers were the first of the two clubs to contest a World Series on the west coast, defeating the Chicago White Sox in 1959. The 1962 Giants made the first California World Series appearance of that franchise, losing to the Yankees. The Dodgers made three World Series appearances in the 1960s: a 1963 win over the Yankees, a 1965 win over the Minnesota Twins and a 1966 loss to the Baltimore Orioles.\n\nIn 1968, the Kansas City Athletics relocated to Oakland and the following year 1969, the National League granted a franchise to San Diego as the San Diego Padres. The A\'s became a powerful dynasty, winning three consecutive World Series from 19721974. In 1974, the A\'s played the Dodgers in the first all-California World Series. The Padres have two World Series appearances (a 1984 loss to the Detroit Tigers, and a 1998 loss to the New York Yankees).\n\nThe Dodgers won two more World Series in the 1980s (1981, 1988). The A\'s again went to three straight world series, from 19881990, winning once. 1988 and 1989 were all-California series as the A\'s lost to the Dodgers and beat the Giants, respectively. The Giants have been in four World Series\' in the new millennium, losing in 2002 to the Anaheim Angels (the most-recent all-California series), and winning in 2010 (Rangers), 2012 (Tigers), and 2014 (Royals).\n\nPrior to 1969, the National League and the American League each crowned its champion (the \"pennant winner\") based on the best win-loss record at the end of the regular season.\n\nA structured playoff series began in 1969, when both the National and American Leagues were reorganized into two divisions each, East and West. The two division winners within each league played each other in a best-of-five League Championship Series to determine who would advance to the World Series. In 1985, the format changed to best-of-seven.\n\nThe National League Championship Series (NLCS) and American League Championship Series (ALCS), since the expansion to best-of-seven, are always played in a 232 format: Games 1, 2, 6 and 7 are played in the stadium of the team that has home-field advantage, and Games 3, 4 and 5 are played in the stadium of the team that does not.\n\nMLB night games started being held in 1935 by the Cincinnati Reds, but the World Series remained a strictly daytime event for years thereafter. In the final game of the 1949 World Series, a Series game was finished under lights for the first time. The first scheduled night World Series game was Game 4 of the 1971 World Series at Three Rivers Stadium.[18] Afterward, World Series games were frequently scheduled at night, when television audiences were larger. Game 6 of the 1987 World Series was the last World Series game played in the daytime,[19] indoors at the Metrodome in Minnesota. (The last World Series played outdoors during the day was the final game of the 1984 series in Detroit\'s Tiger Stadium.)\n\nDuring this seven-year period, only three teams won the World Series: the Oakland Athletics from 1972 to 1974, Cincinnati Reds in 1975 and 1976, and New York Yankees in 1977 and 1978. This is the only time in World Series history in which three teams have won consecutive series in succession. This period was book-ended by World Championships for the Pittsburgh Pirates, in 1971 and 1979.\n\nHowever, the Baltimore Orioles made three consecutive World Series appearances: 1969 (losing to the \"amazing\" eight-year-old franchise New York Mets), 1970 (beating the Reds in their first World Series appearance of the decade), and 1971 (losing to the Pittsburgh Pirates, as well their 1979 appearance, when they again lost to the Pirates), and the Los Angeles Dodgers\' back-to-back World Series appearances in 1977 and 1978 (both losses to the New York Yankees), as well in 1974 losing against the cross-state rival Oakland Athletics.\n\nGame 6 of the 1975 World Series is regarded by most as one of the greatest World Series games ever played. It found the Boston Red Sox winning in the 12th inning in Fenway Park, defeating the Cincinnati Reds to force a seventh and deciding game. The game is best remembered for its exciting lead changes, nail-biting turns of events, and a game-winning walk-off home run by Carlton Fisk, resulting in a 76 Red Sox victory.\n\nThe National and American Leagues operated under essentially identical rules until 1973, when the American League adopted the designated hitter (DH) rule, allowing its teams to use another hitter to bat in place of the (usually) weak-hitting pitcher. The National League did not adopt the DH rule. This presented a problem for the World Series, whose two contestants would now be playing their regular-season games under different rules. From 1973 to 1975, the World Series did not include a DH. Starting in 1976, the World Series allowed for the use of a DH in even-numbered years only. (The Cincinnati Reds swept the 1976 Series in four games, using the same nine-man lineup in each contest. Dan Driessen was the Reds\' DH during the series, thereby becoming the National League\'s first designated hitter.) Finally, in 1986, baseball adopted the current rule in which the DH is used for World Series games played in the AL champion\'s park but not the NL champion\'s. Thus, the DH rule\'s use or non-use can affect the performance of the home team.\n\nThe 1984 Detroit Tigers gained distinction as just the third team in major league history (after the 1927 New York Yankees and 1955 Brooklyn Dodgers) to lead a season wire-to-wire, from opening day through their World Series victory.[20] In the process, Tigers skipper Sparky Anderson became the first manager to win a World Series title in both leagues, having previously won in 1975 and 1976 with the Cincinnati Reds.\n\nThe 1988 World Series is remembered for the iconic home run by the Los Angeles Dodgers\' Kirk Gibson with two outs in the bottom of the ninth inning. The Dodgers were huge underdogs against the 104-win Oakland Athletics, who had swept the Boston Red Sox in the ALCS. Baseball\'s top relief pitcher, Dennis Eckersley, closed out all four games in the ALCS, and he appeared ready to do the same in Game 1 against a Dodgers team trailing 4-3 in the ninth. After getting the first two outs, Eckersley walked Mike Davis of the Dodgers, who were playing without Gibson, their best position player and the NL MVP. Gibson had injured himself in the NLCS and was expected to miss the entire World Series. Yet, despite not being able to walk without a noticeable limp, Gibson surprised all in attendance at Dodger Stadium (and all watching on TV) by pinch-hitting. After two quick strikes and then working the count full, Gibson hit a home run to right, inspiring iconic pronouncements by two legendary broadcasters calling the game, Vin Scully (on TV) and Jack Buck (on radio). On NBC, as Gibson limped around the bases, Scully famously exclaimed, \"the impossible has happened!\" and on radio, Buck equally famously exclaimed, \"I don\'t believe what I just saw!\" Gibson\'s home run set the tone for the series, as the Dodgers went on to beat the A\'s 4 games to 1. The severity of Gibson\'s injury prevented him from playing in any of the remaining games.\n\nWhen the 1989 World Series began, it was notable chiefly for being the first ever World Series matchup between the two San Francisco Bay Area teams, the San Francisco Giants and Oakland Athletics. Oakland won the first two games at home, and the two teams crossed the bridge to San Francisco to play Game 3 on Tuesday, October 17. ABC\'s broadcast of Game 3 began at 5pm local time, approximately 30 minutes before the first pitch was scheduled. At 5:04, while broadcasters Al Michaels and Tim McCarver were narrating highlights and the teams were warming up, the Loma Prieta earthquake occurred (having a surface-wave magnitude of 7.1 with an epicenter ten miles (16km) northeast of Santa Cruz, California). The earthquake caused substantial property and economic damage in the Bay Area and killed 63 people. Television viewers saw the video signal deteriorate and heard Michaels say \"I\'ll tell you what, we\'re having an earth--\" before the feed from Candlestick Park was lost. Fans filing into the stadium saw Candlestick sway visibly during the quake. Television coverage later resumed, using backup generators, with Michaels becoming a news reporter on the unfolding disaster. Approximately 30 minutes after the earthquake, Commissioner Fay Vincent ordered the game to be postponed. Fans, workers, and the teams evacuated a blacked out (although still sunlit) Candlestick. Game 3 was finally played on October 27, and Oakland won that day and the next to complete a four-game sweep.\n\nWorld Series games were contested outside of the United States for the first time in 1992, with the Toronto Blue Jays defeating the Atlanta Braves in six games. The World Series returned to Canada in 1993, with the Blue Jays victorious again, this time against the Philadelphia Phillies in six games. No other Series has featured a team from outside of the United States. Toronto is the only expansion team to win successive World Series titles. The 1993 World Series was also notable for being only the second championship concluded by a home run and the first concluded by a come-from-behind homer, after Joe Carter\'s three-run shot in the bottom of the ninth inning sealed an 86 Toronto win in Game 6. The first Series to end with a homer was the 1960 World Series, when Bill Mazeroski hit a ninth-inning solo shot in Game 7 to win the championship for the Pittsburgh Pirates.\n\nIn 1994, each league was restructured into three divisions, with the three division winners and the newly introduced wild card winner advancing to a best-of-five playoff round (the \"division series\"), the National League Division Series (NLDS) and American League Division Series (ALDS). The team with the best league record is matched against the wild card team, unless they are in the same division, in which case, the team with the second-best record plays against the wild card winner. The remaining two division winners are pitted against each other. The winners of the series in the first round advance to the best-of-seven NLCS and ALCS. Due to a players\' strike, however, the NLDS and ALDS were not played until 1995. Beginning in 1998, home field advantage was given to the team with the better regular season record, with the exception that the Wild Card team cannot get home-field advantage.\n\nAfter the boycott of 1904, the World Series was played every year until 1994 despite World War I, the global influenza pandemic of 19181919, the Great Depression of the 1930s, America\'s involvement in World War II, and even an earthquake in the host cities of the 1989 World Series. A breakdown in collective bargaining led to a strike in August 1994 and the eventual cancellation of the rest of the season, including the playoffs.\n\nAs the labor talks began, baseball franchise owners demanded a salary cap in order to limit payrolls, the elimination of salary arbitration, and the right to retain free agent players by matching a competitor\'s best offer.[citation needed] The Major League Baseball Players Association (MLBPA) refused to agree to limit payrolls, noting that the responsibility for high payrolls lay with those owners who were voluntarily offering contracts. One difficulty in reaching a settlement was the absence of a commissioner.[citation needed] When Fay Vincent was forced to resign in 1992, owners did not replace him, electing instead to make Milwaukee Brewers owner Bud Selig acting commissioner. Thus the commissioner, responsible for ensuring the integrity and protecting the welfare of the game, was an interested party rather than a neutral arbiter, and baseball headed into the 1994 work stoppage without an independent commissioner for the first time since the office was founded in 1920.[citation needed]\n\nThe previous collective bargaining agreement expired on December 31, 1993, and baseball began the 1994 season without a new agreement. Owners and players negotiated as the season progressed, but owners refused to give up the idea of a salary cap and players refused to accept one. On August 12, 1994, the players went on strike. After a month passed with no progress in the labor talks, Selig canceled the rest of the 1994 season and the postseason on September 14. The World Series was not played for the first time in 90 years. The Montreal Expos, now the Washington Nationals, were the best team in baseball at the time of the stoppage, with a record of 7440 (since their founding in 1969, the Expos/Nationals have never played in a World Series.)\n\nThe labor dispute lasted into the spring of 1995, with owners beginning spring training with replacement players. However, the MLBPA returned to work on April 2, 1995 after a federal judge, future U.S. Supreme Court justice Sonia Sotomayor, ruled that the owners had engaged in unfair labor practices.[citation needed] The season started on April 25 and the 1995 World Series was played as scheduled, with Atlanta beating Cleveland four games to two.\n\nThe 2001 World Series was the first World Series to end in November, due to the week-long delay in the regular season after the September 11 attacks. Game 4 had begun on Oct. 31 but went into extra innings and ended early on the morning of Nov. 1, the first time the Series had been played in November. Yankee shortstop Derek Jeter won the game with a 12th inning walk-off home run and was dubbed \"Mr. November\" by elements of the media  echoing the media\'s designation of Reggie Jackson as \"Mr. October\" for his slugging achievements during the 1977 World Series.\n\nWith the 2006 World Series victory by the St. Louis Cardinals, Tony La Russa became the second manager to a win a World Series in both the American and National Leagues.\n\nPrior to 2003, home-field advantage in the World Series alternated from year to year between the NL and AL. After the 2002 Major League Baseball All-Star Game ended in a tie, MLB decided to award home-field advantage in the World Series to the winner of the All-Star Game. Originally implemented as a two-year trial from 2003 to 2004, the practice was extended.\n\nThe American League had won every All-Star Game since this change until 2010 and thus enjoyed home-field advantage from 2002, when it also had home-field advantage based on the alternating schedule, through 2009. From 2003 to 2010, the AL and NL had each won the World Series four times, but none of them had gone the full seven games. Since then, the 2011, 2014, and 2016 World Series have gone the full seven games.\n\nThis rule is subject to debate, with various writers feeling that home-field advantage should be decided based on the regular season records of the participants, not on an exhibition game played several months earlier.[21][22] Some writers especially questioned the integrity of this rule after the 2014 All-Star Game, when St. Louis Cardinals pitcher Adam Wainwright suggested that he intentionally gave Derek Jeter some easy pitches to hit in the New York Yankees\' shortstop\'s final All-Star appearance before he retired at the end of that season.[23][24]\n\nAs Bob Ryan of The Boston Globe wrote in July 2015 about the rule:\n\nHowever, within the last seven seasons, home-field advantage, in terms of deciding World Series games, has not necessarily worked for teams of said games. Since 2014, the home team has not won the deciding game of a World Series.\n\nThe San Francisco Giants won the World Series in 2010, 2012, and 2014 while failing to qualify to play in the postseason in the intervening seasons.\n\nThe Texas Rangers were twice only one strike away from winning their first World Series title in 2011, but the St. Louis Cardinals scored late twice in Game 6 to force a Game 7.\n\nThe Kansas City Royals reached the World Series in 2014, which was their first appearance in the postseason since winning the series in 1985. At the time, it was the longest postseason drought in baseball. They lost in 7 games to the Giants. The following season, the Royals finished with the American League\'s best record, and won a second consecutive American League pennant. They defeated the New York Mets in the World Series 4-1, capturing their first title in 30 years.\n\nIn 2016, the Chicago Cubs ended their 108-year long drought without a World Series title by defeating the Cleveland Indians, rallying from a 31 Series deficit in the process. That extended Cleveland\'s World Series title drought to 68 years and counting -- the Indians last won the Series in 1948 -- now the longest title drought in the majors.\n\nBeginning in 2017, home field advantage in the World Series will be awarded to the league champion team with the better regular season win-loss record.[26]\n\nAmerican League (AL) teams have won 64 of the 112 World Series played (57%). The New York Yankees have won 27 titles, accounting for 24% of all series played and 42% of the wins by American League teams. The St. Louis Cardinals have won 11 World Series, accounting for 10% of all series played and 23% of the 48 National League victories. At least one New York team has been in 54 World Series (48%) of Series played. When the first modern World Series was played in 1903, there were eight teams in each league. These 16 franchises, all of which are still in existence, have each won at least two World Series titles.\n\nThe number of teams was unchanged until 1961, with fourteen \"expansion teams\" joining MLB since then. Twelve have played in a World Series (the Mariners and Expos/Nationals being the two exceptions). The expansion teams have won ten of the 22 Series (45%) in which they have played, which is 9% of all 112 series played since 1903. In 2015, the first World Series featuring only expansion teams was played between the Kansas City Royals and New York Mets.[27]\n\nThis information is up to date through the present time:\n\nWhen two teams share the same state or metropolitan area, fans often develop strong loyalties to one and antipathies towards the other, sometimes building on already-existing rivalries between cities or neighborhoods. Before the introduction of interleague play in 1997, the only opportunity for two teams playing in the same area but in different leagues to face each other in official competition would have been in a World Series.\n\nThe first city to host an entire World Series was Chicago in 1906, when the Chicago White Sox beat the Chicago Cubs in six games.\n\nFourteen \"Subway Series\" have been played entirely within New York City, all including the American League\'s New York Yankees. Thirteen of them matched the Yankees with either the New York Giants or the Brooklyn Dodgers of the National League. The initial instances occurred in 1921 and 1922, when the Giants beat the Yankees in consecutive World Series that were not technically \"subway series\" since the teams shared the Polo Grounds as their home ballpark. The Yankees finally beat the Giants the following year, their first in their brand-new Yankee Stadium, and won the two teams\' three subsequent Fall Classic match-ups in 1936, 1937 and 1951. The Yankees faced Brooklyn seven times in October, winning their first five meetings in 1941, 1947, 1949, 1952 and 1953, before losing to the Dodgers in 1955, Brooklyn\'s sole World Championship. The last Subway Series involving the original New York ballclubs came in 1956, when the Yankees again beat the Dodgers. The trio was separated in 1958 when the Dodgers and Giants moved to California (although the Yankees subsequently met and beat the now-San Francisco Giants in 1962, and played the now-Los Angeles Dodgers four times, losing to them in a four-game sweep in 1963, beating them back-to-back in 1977 and 1978 and losing to them in 1981). An all-New York Series did not recur until 2000, when the Yankees defeated the New York Mets in five games.\n\nThe last World Series played entirely in one ballpark was the 1944 \"Streetcar Series\" between the St. Louis Cardinals and the St. Louis Browns. The Cardinals won in six games, all held in their shared home, Sportsman\'s Park.\n\nThe 1989 World Series, sometimes called the \"Bay Bridge Series\" or the \"BART Series\" (after the connecting transit line), featured the Oakland Athletics and the San Francisco Giants, teams that play just across San Francisco Bay from each other. The series is most remembered for the major earthquake that struck the San Francisco Bay Area just before game 3 was scheduled to begin. The quake caused significant damage to both communities and severed the Bay Bridge that connects them, forcing the postponement of the series. Play resumed ten days later, and the A\'s swept the Giants in four games (the earthquake disruption of the Series almost completely overshadowed the fact that the 1989 Series represented a resumption after many decades of the October rivalry between the Giants and the A\'s dating back to the early years of the 20th Century, when the then-New York Giants had defeated the then-Philadelphia Athletics in 1905, and had lost to them in 1911 and again in 1913).\n\nThe historic rivalry between Northern and Southern California added to the interest in the Oakland Athletics-Los Angeles Dodgers series in 1974 and 1988 and in the San Francisco Giants\' series against the then-Anaheim Angels in 2002.\n\nOther than the St. Louis World Series of 1944, the only postseason tournament held entirely within Missouri was the I-70 Series in 1985 (named for the Interstate Highway connecting the two cities) between the St. Louis Cardinals and the Kansas City Royals, who won at home in the seventh game.\n\nGoing into the 2017 season, there has never been an in-state World Series between the teams in Ohio (Cleveland Indians and Cincinnati Reds), Florida (Tampa Bay Rays and Florida Marlins), Texas (Texas Rangers and Houston Astros  who now both play in the American League since the Astros changed leagues in 2013, making any future joint World Series appearance an impossibility unless one of the teams switches leagues), or Pennsylvania (the Philadelphia Phillies and the Pittsburgh Pirates have been traditional National League rivals going back to the late 19th Century). Neither the Phillies nor the Pirates ever faced the Athletics in October during the latter team\'s tenure in Philadelphia, through 1954. The Boston Red Sox never similarly faced the Braves while the latter team played in Boston through 1952. There also was never an all-Canada World Series between the Toronto Blue Jays and the former Montreal Expos, who never won a National League pennant when they played in that Canadian city from 1969 through 2004. The Expos became the Washington Nationals in 2005  raising the possibility of a potential future \"I-95 World Series\" between the National League team and the AL\'s Baltimore Orioles, who play just 50 miles to the north of Washington. Finally, the Los Angeles and/or Anaheim Angels have never faced off in October against either the Dodgers or against the San Diego Padres for bragging rights in Southern California, although all three of those teams have appeared in the World Series at various times.\n\nAt the time the first modern World Series began in 1903, each league had eight clubs, all of which survive today (although sometimes in a different city or with a new nickname), comprising the \"original sixteen\".\n\nWhen the World Series was first broadcast on television in 1947, it was only televised to a few surrounding areas via coaxial inter-connected stations: New York City; Philadelphia; Schenectady/Albany, New York; Washington, D.C. and surrounding suburbs/environs. In 1948,[32] games in Boston were only seen in the Northeast. Meanwhile, games in Cleveland were only seen in the Midwest and Pittsburgh. The games were open to all channels with a network affiliation.[33][34] In all, the 1948 World Series was televised to fans in seven Midwestern cities: Cleveland, Chicago, Detroit, Milwaukee, St. Louis, and Toledo. By 1949, World Series games could now be seen east of the Mississippi River.[35] The games were open to all channels with a network affiliation.[36] By 1950, World Series games could be seen in most of the country,[37][38][38][39] but not all. 1951 marked the first time that the World Series was televised coast[40] to coast.[32][41][42] Meanwhile, 1955 marked the first time that the World Series was televised in color.[43][44]\n\n^**:Per the current broadcast agreement, the World Series will be televised by Fox through 2021.[45]\n\n\n\n^***:Gillette,[46] which sponsored World Series telecasts exclusively from roughly 1947 to 1965 (prior to 1966, the Series announcers were chosen by the Gillette Company along with the Commissioner of Baseball and NBC), paid for airtime on DuMont\'s owned-and-operated Pittsburgh affiliate, WDTV (now KDKA-TV) to air the World Series. In the meantime, Gillette also bought airtime on ABC, CBS, and NBC. More to the point, in some cities, the World Series was broadcast on three different stations at once.\n\n\n\n^****:NBC was originally scheduled to televise the entire 1995 World Series; however, due to the cancellation of the 1994 Series (which had been slated for ABC, who last televised a World Series in 1989), coverage ended up being split between the two networks. Game5 is, to date, the last Major League Baseball game to be telecast by ABC (had there been a Game7, ABC would\'ve televised it). This was the only World Series to be produced under the \"Baseball Network\" umbrella (a revenue sharing joint venture between Major League Baseball, ABC, and NBC). In July 1995, both networks announced that they would be pulling out of what was supposed to be a six-year-long venture. NBC would next cover the 1997 (NBC\'s first entirely since 1988) and 1999 World Series over the course of a five-year-long contract, in which Fox would cover the World Series in even numbered years (1996, 1998, and 2000).\n\n\n\nDespite its name, the World Series remains solely the championship of the major-league baseball teams in the United States and Canada, although MLB, its players, and North American media sometimes informally refer to World Series winners as \"world champions of baseball\".[47]\n\nThe United States, Canada, and Mexico (Liga Mxicana de Bisbol, established 1925) were the only professional baseball countries until a few decades into the 20th century. The first Japanese professional baseball efforts began in 1920. The current Japanese leagues date from the late 1940s (after World War II). Various Latin American leagues also formed around that time.\n\nBy the 1990s, baseball was played at a highly skilled level in many countries. Reaching North America\'s high-salary major leagues is the goal of many of the best players around the world, which gives a strong international flavor to the Series. Many talented players from Latin America, the Caribbean, the Pacific Rim, and elsewhere now play in the majors. One notable exception is Cuban citizens, because of the political tensions between the US and Cuba since 1959 (yet a number of Cuba\'s finest ballplayers have still managed to defect to the United States over the past half-century to play in the American professional leagues). Japanese professional players also have a difficult time coming to the North American leagues. They become free agents only after nine years playing service in the NPB, although their Japanese teams may at any time \"post\" them for bids from MLB teams, which commonly happens at the player\'s request.\n\nSeveral tournaments feature teams composed only of players from one country, similar to national teams in other sports. The World Baseball Classic, sponsored by Major League Baseball and sanctioned by the sport\'s world governing body, the World Baseball Softball Confederation (WBSC), uses a format similar to the FIFA World Cup to promote competition between nations every four years. The WBSC has since added the Premier12, a tournament also involving national teams; the first event was held in 2015, and is planned to be held every four years (in the middle of the World Baseball Classic cycle). The World Baseball Classic is held in March and the Premier12 is held in November, allowing both events to feature top-level players from all nations. The predecessor to the WBSC as the sport\'s international governing body, the International Baseball Federation, also sponsored a Baseball World Cup to crown a world champion. However, because the World Cup was held during the Northern Hemisphere summer, during the playing season of almost all top-level leagues, its teams did not feature the best talent from each nation. As a result, baseball fans paid little or no attention to the World Cup and generally disregarded its results. The Caribbean Series features competition among the league champions from Mexico, Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic, and Venezuela but unlike the FIFA Club World Cup, there is no club competition that features champions from all professional leagues across the world.','2017-03-25 03:51:12'),(122,17,'132e965bbd6ca0d90a7a759ec22c4764e9e3ad9b8e908993f7214fb12aa26bdf','46bdcc3283e54ab0b959f768b8c74715','','','Why do we call the final baseball series, the World Series?

This was most evident in the Reach and Spalding Guides, both of which referred, over the years, to the \"World\'s Series\" and eventually the \"World Series\".\n\n\n\nIn the 1930\'s, these guides merged, ceasing publication in 1941, when they were replaced by The Sporting News Guide, who used \"World\'s Series\" from 1942 through 1963, switching to the \"World Series\" in 1964.\n\n\n\nYours in baseball,\n\n\n\nRick \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n','2017-03-25 03:51:12'),(123,17,'132e965bbd6ca0d90a7a759ec22c4764e9e3ad9b8e908993f7214fb12aa26bdf','4345dc90b1c049c88a2aeae7ddc04704','','','In baseball, the 1884 World Series was a post-season championship series between the Providence Grays of the National League and the New York Metropolitans of the American Association at the Polo Grounds in New York City.\n\nWhile the 1884 post-season championship series was the first such to be referred to as the \"World\'s Series,\" Major League Baseball considers the 1903 World Series the first.\n\nIn 1884, Metropolitans manager Jim Mutrie issued a challenge to his NL counterpart, Frank Bancroft of the Grays. Mutrie\'s challenge was for a best-of-three series. Each team would put up a thousand dollars with the winner taking the booty.\n\nThis pre-modern-era World Series would feature a pitching match-up of future Hall of Famers and 300-game winners Charles \"Old Hoss\" Radbourn and Tim Keefe. That was the year Radbourn won his season-record 59 games (some sources say 60) for the Grays. Keefe was a \"mere\" 3717. Playing under American Association rules, Radbourn and the Grays defeated the New York team in the first two games, 60 and 31.\n\nOnly the first game went the full nine innings; the others were called after seven and six, because of darkness and extreme cold, respectively. The third game arguably should never have been played as the format was best-of-three, and Providence clinched in two. It was played with the hope of generating further revenue.\n\nThe crowd for the third game comprised only 300 people due to bitter cold. The Gray did not want to play due to the weather but were given the option of choosing the umpire if they would play. The Grays accepted and strategically chose Keefe, the Mets best pitcher. Radbourn, pitching his third complete game in three days, led the Grays to a 122 rout. For the series, Radbourn allowed 11 hits and no earned runs in 22 innings.\n\nLocal newspaper The New York Clipper called the series \"The Championship of the United States.\" Several newspapers such as The Sporting Life penned the Grays as \"World Champions\", and the new title stuck.\n\nThe total attendance for the three games was 3,800.

SeeExample(s)\n\nMany believe that the name World Series is American hype or arrogance, but the truth is that the Series was named after the New York World newspaper who sponsored the title games in the early part of the century. I followed the Blue Jays through their futility and then rooted for Atlanta in the wonderful World Series (originally named, by the way, for the New York World, the newspaper that was its first sponsor).\n\nFor over a century now, baseballs annual championship, the World Series, has been an essential American ritual. The modern World Series began in 1903, when the National Leagues pennant-winning Pittsburgh Pirates agreed to a best-of-nine playoff series against Boston, champions of the upstart American League (which had made the jump from minor league to major league just two years earlier).\n\nThe concept of a post-season championship series evolved long before 1903, however. Teams engaged in exhibitions and unofficial regional playoffs after the end of regular-season play since the earliest days of professional baseball, and after 1882 season the National Leagues first-place Chicago team played a pair of games against Cincinnati, the champions of the newly-formed American Association. These games were primarily exhibition contests (because the National League had yet to acknowledge the legitimacy of the American Association), but every year from 1884 through 1890 the two leagues champions met in post-season series of varying lengths (an event that was known, among other names, as the world series).\n\nThe 1891 playoff was cancelled due to interleague squabbling, and any hopes for its resurrection were dashed when the American Association folded before the 1892 season. The National League expanded from eight teams to twelve in 1892 by absorbing four of the entries from the failed American Association, and a post-season championship was created by dividing the season into halves and pitting the winners of the two halves against each other.\n\nThe split-season format proved unpopular and therefore didnt come off in 1893, so an entrepreneur from Pittsburgh named Temple promoted a new post-season scheme the next year by offering to award an ornate $800 cup to the winner of a best-of-seven series between the National Leagues first- and second-place finishers. The Temple Cup championship series, as it became known, was held for the four years between 1894 and 1897, after which a lack of fan interest resulted in its termination and the return of the cup to its donor.\n\nSave for a brief series between the National Leagues pennant-winning Brooklyn Superbas and the runner-up Pittsburgh Pirates after the 1900 season (the winner receiving a silver cup donated by the Pittsburgh Chronicle-Telegraph), post-season play did not resume until the modern World Series matching American and National league champions against each other began in 1903.\n\nSomewhere along the way (the earliest citation weve found so far is from 1991), people have picked up the notion that the fall classic, baseballs World Series, is so named not because the victors are considered the worlds champions, but because the contest was originally sponsored by the New York World newspaper. Perhaps this belief springs from todays hyper-commercial sporting climate, in which nearly all athletic championships and sports stadiums are named for corporate sponsors, or perhaps it springs from the incongruity of the winners of a contest featuring only teams from North America being declared world champions, but so prevalent is this erroneous belief that it is now regularly cited as a fact, despite a complete lack of any supporting evidence.\n\nThe New York World was established in 1860, just before the Civil War, and it fared poorly throughout the 1870s before being bought up by Joseph Pulitzer in 1883. Over the next half-century, the World was renowned for everything from its yellow journalism to its debut of the crossword puzzle; in 1930 it was sold and merged with the Evening Telegram to become the New York World-Telegram.\n\nThe New York World never had anything to do with the World Series, however, other than being one of the many newspapers to report the results. The modern World Series (like its predecessor series waged between National League and American Association teams from 1884-1890) was so named not because of any affiliation with a corporate sponsor, but because the winner was considered the worlds title was therefore simply a shortened form of the phrase worlds championship series.\n\nNegative evidence is easily uncovered by reading accounts of the first few World Series in the major newspapers of the era. The first several contests between the two league champions were reported under a variety of series, world championship series, worlds eventually becoming standardized in name as the World Series. If the name had derived from the New York Worlds sponsorship, it would have been known as nothing but the World Series from the very beginning (and as far back as 1884).\n\nThe National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum concurs, a 1999 article noting of this claim that:\n\n[O]thers have asked that question of the staff at the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, N.Y. in recent weeks. Theres no evidence suggesting it was ever sponsored by the New York World newspaper, said Hall of Fame researcher Eric Enders. When the World Series between the National and American leagues began in 1903, the owners borrowed the name from the world championship series held in the 1880s between the National League and the American Association. Enders concludes the name didnt originate from the name of the long-defunct newspaper.

The show premiered on NBC on October 11, 1975, under the original title NBC\'s Saturday Night. The show\'s comedy sketches, which parody contemporary culture and politics, are performed by a large and varying cast of repertory and newer cast members. Each episode is hosted by a celebrity guest (who usually delivers an opening monologue and performs in sketches with the cast) and features performances by a musical guest. An episode normally begins with a cold open sketch that ends with someone breaking character and proclaiming, \"Live from New York, it\'s Saturday Night!\", properly beginning the show.\n\nIn 1980, Michaels left the series to explore other opportunities. He was replaced by Jean Doumanian, who was replaced by Ebersol after a season of bad reviews. Ebersol ran the show until 1985, when Michaels returned; Michaels has remained since then. Many of SNL\'s cast found national stardom while appearing on the show, and achieved success in film and television, both in front of and behind the camera. Others associated with the show, such as writers, have gone on to successful careers creating, writing, or starring in TV and film.\n\nBroadcast from Studio 8H at NBC\'s headquarters in the Comcast Building, SNL has aired 823 episodes since its debut, and began its forty-second season on October 1, 2016, making it one of the longest-running network television programs in the United States. The show format has been developed and recreated in several countries, meeting with different levels of success. Successful sketches have seen life outside of the show as feature films, although only two met with critical and financial success: The Blues Brothers (1980) and Wayne\'s World (1992). The show has been marketed in other ways, including home media releases of \"best of\" and whole seasons, and books and documentaries about behind-the-scenes activities of running and developing the show.\n\nThroughout four decades on air, Saturday Night Live has received a number of awards, including 50 Primetime Emmy Awards, two Peabody Awards, and three Writers Guild of America Awards. In 2000, it was inducted into the National Association of Broadcasters Hall of Fame. It was ranked tenth in TV Guide\'s \"50 Greatest TV Shows of All Time\" list, and in 2007 it was listed as one of Time magazine\'s \"100 Best TV Shows of All-TIME\". As of 2012, it has received 156 Emmy nominations, the most received by any TV show. The live aspect of the show has resulted in several controversies and acts of censorship, with mistakes and intentional acts of sabotage by performers as well as guests.\n\nFrom 1965 until September 1975, NBC ran The Best of Carson reruns of The Tonight Show, airing them on either Saturday or Sunday night at local affiliates\' discretion (originally known as The Saturday/Sunday Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson). In 1974, Johnny Carson announced that he wanted the weekend shows pulled and saved so that they could be aired during weeknights, allowing him to take time off.[1]\n\nIn 1974, NBC president Herbert Schlosser approached his vice president of late night programming, Dick Ebersol, and asked him to create a show to fill the Saturday night time slot. At the suggestion of Paramount Pictures executive Barry Diller, Schlosser and Ebersol then approached Lorne Michaels. Over the next three weeks, Ebersol and Michaels developed the latter\'s idea for a variety show featuring high-concept comedy sketches, political satire, and music performances. By 1975 Michaels had assembled a talented cast, including Dan Aykroyd, John Belushi, Chevy Chase, Jane Curtin, Garrett Morris, Laraine Newman, Michael O\'Donoghue, Gilda Radner,[2] and George Coe.[3] The show was originally called NBC\'s Saturday Night, because Saturday Night Live was in use by Saturday Night Live with Howard Cosell on the rival network ABC.[4] NBC purchased the rights to the name in 1976 and officially adopted the new title on March 26, 1977.[5]\n\nDebuting on October 11, 1975,[6] the show immediately developed a cult following, eventually becoming a mainstream hit and spawning (in 1978) \"Best of Saturday Night Live\" compilations that reached viewers who could not stay awake for the live broadcasts. But during the first season in 1975 and 1976, according to a book about the show authored by Doug Hill and Jeff Weingrad, some NBC executives were not satisfied with the show\'s Nielsen ratings and shares.[7] Lorne Michaels pointed out to them that Nielsen\'s measurement of demographics indicated that baby boomers constituted a large majority of the viewers who did commit to watching the show, and many of them watched little else on television.[8] In 1975 and 1976, they were the most desirable demographic for television advertisers. NBC executives agreed with Michaels and decided to keep the show on the air despite many angry letters and phone calls that the network received from viewers who were offended by certain sketches.[9]\n\nThey included a Weekend Update segment on April 24, 1976, the 18th episode, that ridiculed Aspen, Colorado murder suspect Claudine Longet and warranted an on-air apology by announcer Don Pardo during the following episode.[10] Herminio Traviesas, a censor who was vice president of the network\'s Standards and Practices department, objected to cast member Laraine Newman\'s use of the term \"pissed off\" in the March 13, 1976 episode with host Anthony Perkins, according to the book by Hill and Weingrad, and was in the process of placing the show on a permanent delay of several seconds, instead of live, but he changed his mind after Newman personally apologized to him.[11]\n\nChevy Chase left the show in November of the second season and was replaced a few months later by the then-unknown comic actor Bill Murray. Aykroyd and Belushi left the show in 1979 after the end of season four. In May 1980 (after season five), Michaelsemotionally and physically exhaustedrequested to put the show on hiatus for a year to give him time and energy to pursue other projects. Concerned that the show would be cancelled without him, Michaels suggested writers Al Franken, Tom Davis, and Jim Downey as his replacements. NBC president Fred Silverman disliked Franken, however, and was infuriated by Franken\'s Weekend Update routine called \"Limo for a Lame-O\", a scathing critique of Silverman\'s job performance at the network and his insistence on traveling by limousine at the network\'s expense. Silverman blamed Michaels for approving this Weekend Update segment. Unable to get the deal he wanted, Michaels chose to leave NBC for Paramount Pictures, intending to take his associate producer, Jean Doumanian, with him. Michaels later learned that Doumanian had been given his position at SNL after being recommended by her friend, NBC vice president Barbara Gallagher. Michaels\' departure led to most of the cast and writing staff leaving the show.\n\nThe reputation of the show as a springboard to fame meant that many aspiring stars were eager to join the new series. Doumanian was tasked with hiring a full cast and writing staff in less than three months, and NBC immediately cut the show\'s budget from the previous $1 million per episode down to just $350,000. Doumanian faced resentment and sabotage from the remaining Michaels staff, particularly males who did not appreciate a woman believing she could take Michaels\' place. The season was a disaster; ratings plummeted, and audiences failed to connect to the original cast\'s replacements, such as Charles Rocket and Ann Risley. Doumanian\'s fate was sealed when, during a sketch, Rocket said \"fuck\" on live television. After only ten months, Doumanian was dismissed.[19] Although executives suggested that SNL be left to die, network chief Brandon Tartikoff wanted to keep the show on the air, believing that the concept was more important to the network than money. Tartikoff turned to Ebersol as his choice for the new producer. Ebersol previously had been fired by Silverman. Ebersol gained Michaels\' approval in an attempt to avoid the same staff sabotage that had blighted Doumanian\'s tenure.\n\nEbersol\'s tenure saw commercial success, but was considered lackluster compared to the Michaels era, except for the breakout of cast member Eddie Murphy. Murphy, the main draw of the cast, left in 1984 to pursue his already successful film career, and Ebersol decided to again rebuild the cast. He broke with history by hiring established comedians such as Billy Crystal and Martin Short who could bring their already successful material to the show. Ebersol\'s final year with this new cast is considered one of the series\' funniest, but had strayed far from the precedent-shattering show that Michaels had created. After that season, Ebersol wanted a more significant revamp, including departing from the show\'s established \"live\" format.[citation needed] Following unsuccessful forays into film and television, in need of money, and eager not to see Tartikoff cancel the show, Michaels finally returned in 1985 after Ebersol opted not to. The show was again recast, with Michaels borrowing Ebersol\'s idea, and seeking out established actors such as Joan Cusack and Robert Downey, Jr. The cast and writers struggled creatively, and in April 1986, Tartikoff made the decision to cancel the show, until he was convinced by producer Bernie Brillstein to give it one more year. The show was renewed but for the first time in its history, for only thirteen episodes instead of the usual twenty-two. Michaels again fired most of the cast and, learning his lesson from the previous seasons, sought out unknown talent such as Dana Carvey and Phil Hartman instead of known names.\n\nThe show ran successfully again until it lost Carvey and Hartman, two of its biggest stars, between 1992 and 1994. Wanting to increase SNL\'s ratings and profitability, then-NBC West Coast president Don Ohlmeyer and other executives began to actively interfere in the show, recommending that new stars such as Chris Farley and Adam Sandler be fired because Ohlmeyer did not \"get\" them, and critiquing the costly nature of performing the show live. The show faced increasing criticism from the press and cast, in part encouraged by the NBC executives hoping to weaken Michaels\' position. Michaels received a lucrative offer to develop a Saturday night project for CBS during this time, but remained loyal to SNL. By 1995, Farley and Sandler were fired, and Mike Myers, another popular cast member, had left for a film career, but a new cast waited to replace them, featuring the likes of Will Ferrell, Jimmy Fallon, and Tina Fey. The show focused on performers, and writers were forced to supply material for the cast\'s existing characters before they could write original sketches. By 1997, Ohlmeyer renewed his focus on limiting Michaels\' independence, forcing the removal of writer Jim Downey and cast member Norm Macdonald.\n\nThe original 1975 cast of SNL, officially known on-air as \"The Not Ready For Prime-Time Players\",[33] a term coined by writer Herb Sargent, included Laraine Newman, John Belushi, Jane Curtin, Gilda Radner, Dan Aykroyd, Garrett Morris, and Chevy Chase. Radner was the first person hired after Michaels himself. Although Chase became a performer, he was hired on a one-year writer contract, and refused to sign the performer contract that was repeatedly given to him, allowing him to leave the show after the first season in 1976. Newman was brought aboard after having a prior working relationship with Michaels. Morris was initially brought in as a writer, but attempts to have him fired by another writer led Michaels to have Morris audition for the cast, where he turned in a successful performance. Curtin and Belushi were the last two cast members hired. Belushi had a disdain for television and had repeatedly turned down offers to appear on other shows, but decided to work with the show because of the involvement of Radner, and writers Anne Beatts and Michael O\'Donoghue. Michaels was still reluctant to hire Belushi, believing he would be a source of trouble for the show, but Beatts, O\'Donoghue, and Ebersol successfully argued for his inclusion.\n\nAfter Chase left the show, he was replaced by Bill Murray, whom Michaels had intended to hire for the first-season cast, but was unable to because of budget restrictions. When Chase returned to host in 1978, he found the remaining cast resentful at his departure and his success, particularly Belushi. Murray, goaded by the rest of the cast, and Chase came to blows shortly before the show. Chase\'s departure for film made Michaels possessive of his talent; he threatened to fire Aykroyd if he took the role of D-Day in the 1978 comedy Animal House, and later refused to allow SNL musician Paul Shaffer to participate in The Blues Brothers (1980) with Aykroyd and Belushi after they left in 1979 to pursue film careers.[42] Michaels began to struggle to hold the remaining cast together in the wake of Chase, Aykroyd, and Belushi\'s independent successes. Radner had a one-woman Broadway show and Murray starred in the 1979 comedy Meatballs. In 1980, when Michaels chose to leave the series to pursue other interests, he was followed by the remaining original cast, Curtin, Newman, and Morris, Murray, and additional cast members.[42]\n\nThe Doumanian-era cast faced immediate comparison to the beloved former cast and were not received favorably. Ebersol fired the majority of her hires, except for two unknown comedians: Eddie Murphy and Joe Piscopo. Talent coordinator Neil Levy claimed Murphy contacted and pleaded with him for a role on the show, and after seeing him audition, Levy fought with Doumanian to cast him instead of Robert Townsend. Doumanian wanted only one black cast member and favored Townsend, but Levy convinced her to choose Murphy. Doumanian, however, also claimed credit for discovering Murphy and fighting with NBC executives to bring him onto the show. Even so, Murphy would languish as a background character until Ebersol took charge, after which Murphy was credited with much of that era\'s success.[47] Murphy\'s star exploded, and he quickly appeared in films such as 48 Hrs. and Trading Places, before leaving for his film career in early 1984. Much of the Ebersol cast departed after the 198384 season and were replaced with established comedians who could supply their own material, but at an inflated cost; Billy Crystal and Martin Short were paid $25,000 and $20,000 per episode respectively, a far cry from earlier salaries. Michaels\' return in 1985 saw a cast reset that featured established talent such as Robert Downey Jr., Jon Lovitz and Dennis Miller. The season was poorly received, and another reset followed in 1986. Learning his lesson from the previous season, Michaels avoided known talent in favor of actual ability. He kept Lovitz, Miller and Nora Dunn, and brought in new, untested talent such as Dana Carvey, Phil Hartman, and Jan Hooks, who together would define a new era on the show into the early 1990s.\n\nIn 1989-90, new talent such as Mike Myers, Adam Sandler, and Chris Farley were added. Afraid of cast members leaving for film careers, Michaels had overcrowded the cast, causing a divide between the veteran members and the new, younger talent, increasing competition for limited screen time. By 1995, Carvey and Hartman had left, taking with them a virtual army of characters, Myers quit for his movie career, and increasing network pressure forced Michaels to fire Sandler and Farley. The show saw its next major overhaul, bringing in a new cast including Will Ferrell, Tina Fey, and Jimmy Fallon. While cast members would leave over the following two decades, the show saw its next biggest transition in 2013, with the addition of 6 cast members to compensate for the departure of several longtime cast members like Bill Hader, Jason Sudeikis, and Fred Armisen.[53]\n\nSNL has featured over 140 cast members including, besides the above-mentioned players, Rachel Dratch, Amy Poehler, Chris Rock, David Spade, Will Forte, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Tracy Morgan, Chris Parnell, Maya Rudolph, Andy Samberg, Kristen Wiig, and many others. Darrell Hammond is the longest-serving cast member, having been a part of the cast for fourteen years between 1995 and 2009, and returned in 2014 as the show\'s announcer following the death of Don Pardo.[54][55] Those selected to join the cast of SNL are normally already accomplished performers, recruited from improvisational comedy groups such as The Groundlings (Ferrell, Hartman, Lovitz, Wiig[57]) and The Second City (Aykroyd, Farley, Fey,[58] Tim Meadows), or established stand-up comedians (Carvey, Sandler, Rock, Norm Macdonald), who already possess the training or experience necessary for SNL.[59]\n\nOf the many roles available in the show, one of the longest-running and most coveted is being the host of \"Weekend Update\", a segment which has alternated between having one or two hosts, and which allows the cast members involved to perform as themselves and be on camera for an extended period of time. Many of the \"Weekend Update\" hosts have gone on to find greater success outside of the show, including: Chase, Curtin, Murray, Miller, Macdonald, Fey, Fallon, and Poehler. From 2008, Seth Meyers was the solo host of \"Weekend Update\", before being partnered with Cecily Strong in 2013. After Meyers left for Late Night with Seth Meyers in February 2014, Strong was paired with head writer Colin Jost.[63] The cast is divided into two tiers: the more established group of repertory players; and newer, unproven cast members known as featured players, who may eventually be promoted to the repertory stable.\n\nThe cast were often contracted from anywhere between five and six years to the show,[65][66] but starting with the 19992000 season, new hires were tied to a rewritten contract that allowed NBC to take a cast member in at least their second year and put them in an NBC sitcom. Cast are given the option of rejecting the first two sitcom offers but must accept the third offer, with the sitcom contract length dictated by NBC and potentially lasting up to six years.[66] The move drew criticism from talent agents and managers who believed that a cast member could be locked into a contract with NBC for twelve years; six on SNL and then six on a sitcom. The contract also optioned the cast member for three feature films produced by SNL Films, a company owned by NBC, Paramount Pictures, and Michaels. The new contracts were reportedly developed after many previously unknown cast, such as Myers and Sandler, gained fame on SNL only to leave and make money for other studios.[66] In a 2010 interview, Wiig was reported to be contracted to SNL for a total of seven years.[67] The contracts also contain a network option which allows NBC to remove a cast member at any time. In the first season of the show, cast were paid $750 per episode, rising to $2,000 by season two, and $4,000 by season four. By the late 1990s, new cast members received a salary between $5,000[66] and $5,500 per episode, increasing to $6,000 in the second year and up to $12,500 for a cast member in their fifth year. Performers could earn an additional $1,500 per episode for writing a sketch which made it to air. In 2001, Ferrell became the highest paid cast member, being paid $350,000 per season (approximately $17,500 per episode).[70] In 2014, Sasheer Zamata was added as a cast member in mid-season after criticism about the show\'s lack of an African-American woman.[71][72][73]\n\nAs of the 201314 season, Colin Jost and Rob Klein are the show\'s co-head writers. Meyers had been co-head writer since 2005 and became the single head writer from 2008 to 2012. The \"Weekend Update\" segment has its own dedicated team of writers led by head writer and producer Alex Baze as of the 201112 season.[74][75][76] Scenes on \"Weekend Update\" that involve members of the cast acting in-character alongside the host are often written by staff writers outside of the dedicated \"Weekend Update\" team, who know those characters better.[76]\n\nSNL writers are often also performers or experienced in writing and improvisational comedy. Many are hired from similar backgrounds such as The Groundlings, Second City, Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre, and ImprovOlympic.[42] Comedian Jim Downey was head writer for nine years beginning in 1985.[77] Experienced writers with backgrounds in television shows are also sometimes brought into the SNL writing room. Like the SNL cast that step before the cameras, many of the writers have been able to find their own success outside the show such as Conan O\'Brien, who was brought into SNL from The Groundlings, went on to writing for The Simpsons, and eventually began hosting his own show,[78] and former head writer Adam McKay who, along with performer Ferrell, founded the successful comedy website Funny or Die.[79] In 2000, Tina Fey became the first female SNL head writer[80][81] and successfully made the transition to starring on the show,[82] as well as writing and starring in feature films,[83][84][85] and ultimately creating and starring in her own show 30 Rockpartly based on her SNL experiences.[86] In 2005, Fey was being paid $1.5 million per season for her dual role as head writer and performer.[87]\n\nDon Pardo served as the announcer for the series when it began[88] and continued in the role for all but season seven between 1981 and 1982, when Michaels had left and Mel Brandt and Bill Hanrahan filled the announcing role. In 2004, Pardo announced that he would step down from his position, but then continued in the role until 2009 where he again announced his retirement, but then continued into the 200910 season.[88] In 2010, then 92-year-old Pardo was reported to be again considering his retirement, but continued to serve as announcer until his death at age 96 on August 18, 2014, following the 39th season. Apart from a brief period in 2006 in which Pardo pre-recorded his announcements at his home in Arizona, he flew to New York City to perform his announcing duties live.[88][89] Cast members Joe Piscopo[90] and Darrell Hammond also periodically impersonated Pardo and fulfilled his announcing duties when Pardo was unavailable. Hammond took over as full-time announcer starting with season 40.[92]\n\nA typical episode of SNL will feature a single host chosen for their popularity or novelty, or because they have a film, album, or other work being released near the time of their appearance on the show. The host delivers the opening monologue and performs in sketches with the cast. Traditionally the host of the show ends the opening monologue by introducing the musical guest for the night. Comedian George Carlin was the first to host SNL in the debut October 1975 episode;[94] three episodes later, Candice Bergen became the first female host and subsequently the first to host more than once. Hosts have been drawn from a wide spectrum of backgrounds, from actors, such as Christopher Walken, Buck Henry, and John Goodman, to musicians like Dolly Parton, to political activist Ralph Nader. Guests who have hosted five or more times are sometimes referred to as belonging to the Five-Timers Club, a term that originated on a sketch performed on Tom Hanks\' fifth episode.[99] As of February 11, 2017, actor Alec Baldwin holds the record for most times hosting, having performed the duty on seventeen different occasions since 1990; Baldwin took the record from actor Steve Martin who had hosted fifteen times since 1976.[100]\n\nEach episode also features a musical guest, a solo act or a band, who perform two to three musical numbers. Occasionally, the musical guest has also simultaneously served as the host. As of May 19, 2012, Dave Grohl is the most frequent musical guest, performing on eleven shows since 1992.[101] Michaels does not allow musical guests to perform using lip-synching tracks, believing it diminishes the live aspect of the show. Exceptions are only made when the musical act is focused on intense dance routines instead of vocals, where it is difficult to be both heavily physically active and sing simultaneously.[103] A 1975 performance by pop group ABBA was the first and only act to feature lip-synching, until the controversial 2004 performance of Ashlee Simpson.\n\nThe Saturday Night Live Band (also known as \"The Live Band\") is the house band for SNL. Academy Award-winning composer Howard Shore served as the first musical director, from 1975 to 1980, appearing in many musical sketches, including Howard Shore and His All-Nurse Band and (backing a U.S. Coast Guard chorus) Howard Shore and the Shore Patrol. Over the years, the band has featured several New York studio musicians including Paul Shaffer (19751980), Lou Marini (19751983), David Sanborn (1975), Michael Brecker (early 1980s), Ray Chew (19801983), Alan Rubin (19751983), Georg Wadenius (19791985), Steve Ferrone (1985), David Johansen (performing as Buster Poindexter), Tom Malone (who took over as musical director from 1981 to 1985), and G.E. Smith (musical director from 1985 to 1995). The band is currently under the leadership of Tower of Power alumnus Lenny Pickett, keyboardist Leon Pendarvis and Eli Bruegemann, who does not play in the band on the live show. The number of musicians has varied over the years, but the basic instrumentation has been three saxophones (alto, tenor and baritone), one trombone, one trumpet, and a rhythm section featuring two keyboards (piano and Hammond organ), a guitar, bass guitar, drums, and an extra percussionist, not a permanent part of the band until Valerie Naranjo\'s arrival in 1995. The 19831984 and 19841985 seasons featured the smallest band, a six-piece combo. The band plays instrumentals leading in and out of station breaks; affiliates who run no advertising during these interludes hear the band play complete songs behind a Saturday Night Live bumper graphic until the program resumes.[104]\n\nSince the show\'s inception, SNL has aired from Studio 8H, located on floors 8 and 9 of the Comcast Building (formerly the RCA Building and GE Building) (30 Rockefeller Plaza, or \"30 Rock\"). The studio had originally been used as a radio soundstage for Arturo Toscanini and the NBC Symphony Orchestra. Michaels was dumbfounded when he originally inspected Studio 8H in 1975, and found it technically limited, outdated, in need of repair, and lacking the capacity to host a live show. Michaels demanded that NBC executives rebuild the studio and improve the acoustics to accommodate the intended musical acts, at a cost of approximately $300,000. Three of the first four shows of the 197677 season were shot at the former NBC Studios in Brooklyn, due to NBC News using Studio 8H for Presidential election coverage.[107]\n\nDuring the summer 2005 shooting hiatus, crews began renovations on Studio 8H. With its thirty-first-season premiere in October 2005, the show began broadcasting in high-definition television, appearing letterboxed on conventional television screens. The offices of SNL writers, producers, and other staff can be found on the 17th floor of \"30 Rock\".\n\nProduction on an SNL episode will normally start on a Monday with a free-form pitch meeting[111] between the cast, writers, producers including Michaels, and the guest host, in Michaels\' office, over two hours. The host is invited to pitch ideas during this meeting. Although some sketch writing may occur on the day, the bulk of the work revolves around pitching ideas. Tuesday is the only day dedicated purely to writing the scripts, a process which usually extends through the night into the following morning. Writing may not begin until 8pm on the Tuesday evening.[111] At 5pm on Wednesday, the sketches are read by the cast during a round-table meeting in the writers room,[111] attended by the writers and producers present during the pitch meeting, technical experts such as make-up artists, who may be required to realize certain sketch ideas such as those using prosthetics, and other producers, resulting in an attendance of approximately fifty people. At this point there may be at least 40 sketch ideas which are read-through in turn, lasting upwards of three hours.\n\nAfter completion of the read-through, Michaels, the head writer, the guest host, and some of the show producers will move to Michaels\' office to decide the layout of the show and decide which of the sketches will be developed for air. Once complete, the writers and cast are allowed into Michaels\' office to view the show breakdown and learn whether or not their sketch has survived. Sketches may be rewritten starting the same day, but will certainly commence on Thursday, work focuses on developing and rewriting the remaining sketches, and possibly rehearsals.[111] If a sketch is still scheduled beyond Thursday, it is rehearsed on Friday or Saturday before moving to a rehearsal before a live audience at 8pm, again on Saturday before the live show.[111] After the rehearsal, Michaels will review the show lineup to ensure it meets a 90-minute length, and sketches that have made it as far as the live rehearsal may be removed. This often results in less than two days of rehearsal for the eight to twelve sketches that have made it to the stage that then may appear on the live broadcast. The opening monologue, spoken by the guest host, is given low priority and can be written as late as Saturday afternoon.\n\nAccording to an interview with Fey in 2004, the three- to four-member dedicated \"Weekend Update\" writing team will write jokes throughout the week. The host(s) of \"Weekend Update\" will normally not work with, or read the scripts from, the team until Thursday evening, after the main show sketches have been finalized. The host(s) will then work on contributing to the script where necessary.[116][117]\n\nWith onsite facilities housed on floors 8 and 17 of Rockefeller Plaza, post-production duties on live broadcasts of Saturday Night Live include the mixing of audio and video elements by the Senior Audio Mixer, coupled with additional audio feeds consisting of music, sound effects, music scoring and pre-recorded voiceovers. All sources are stored digitally, with shows captured and segregated into individual elements to reorganise for future repeats and syndication. The production tracking system was migrated from primarily analog to digital in 1998, with live shows typically requiring 1.5 terabytes of storage, consisting of audio elements and 5 cameras\' worth of visual elements.[118] Elements of Saturday Night Live that are pre-recorded, such as certain commercial parodies, SNL Digital Shorts, and show graphics are processed off-site in the post-production facilities of Broadway Video.[119][120]\n\nStudio 8H production facilities are maintained by NBC Production Services. Video camera equipment includes four Sony BVP-700 CCD cameras, and two Sony BVP-750 CCD handheld cameras, both using Vinten pedestals. A GVG 4000-3 digital component production switcher, and GVG 7000 digital component routing switcher are used to route visual feeds to the control room, with multiple digital and analogue video recorders used to store footage. Graphics are provided by a Chyron Lyric Pro character generator and an Avid Deko character generator. Audio facilities consist of a Calrec T Series digitally controlled analogue mixing console, and a Yamaha digital mixing console used for tape playback support and utility audio work.[121] While exact budgets for other seasons are not known, the 39th season (2013-2014) had a budget of just over $70 million, for which it received a subsidy from New York State in the amount of $12.3 million.[122]\n\nAs of 2009, the opening title sequence and opening montage is shot using the Canon EOS 5D Mark II and Canon EOS 7D digital SLR cameras. Typical elements are recorded at 30fps, with slow-motion sequences shot at 60fps, both in full 1080p high definition.[123]\n\nEdie Baskin was the original SNL photographer. She was hired after Michaels saw her photographs of Las Vegas and other work. Baskin helped create the opening title sequence for the show by taking photos of New York City at night. The first episode used publicity photos of Carlin as transitional bumpers between the show and commercial breaks, the second episode used photos Baskin had already taken of host Paul Simon. It was then that Michaels suggested that Baskin photograph the hosts for the bumpers instead of using publicity photos, beginning a tradition which continues today.\n\nSince 1999, Mary Ellen Matthews has been the official photographer of SNL, responsible for devising distinctive photo layouts and aesthetics for still imagery used on the show. Matthews creates photo portraits of the hosts and musical guests of each episode which are used as commercial bumpers. The limited time frame between the host\'s involvement in the production process and the Live show requires Matthews to create makeshift photo studios on site at 30 Rock, with Matthews attempting to shoot the host on Tuesday and the musical guest on Thursday, although the availability of either can mean the photoshoot for both occurs as late as Thursday.[126] Matthews employs flattering portrait lighting with hard lights to achieve a Hollywood style. On the lighting, Matthews commented: \"I think it just helps the image pop off the screen...If you use soft or flat lighting, it becomes not as dimensional...The [classic Hollywood lighting] gives a little more contrast, and if I use edge lights and then light the background, it goes farther and farther back. I try to achieve that depth as much as I can.\"[127] Matthews is also responsible for taking cast photos, behind the scenes images, documenting rehearsals, and promotional photos. As of 2010, she has also been involved in directing videos, including the show title sequence.[127]\n\nThe show usually begins at 11:29:30p.m. (Eastern Time),[128] unless a delay occurs (more commonly, due to sporting events that run past 11:00p.m. Eastern, delaying local newscasts that lead into that week\'s SNL broadcast on most NBC stations). The show broadcasts for 92 minutes (counting commercial breaks), ending at 1:02a.m. For the Mountain except for KSNG, KSNK, and KQCD, and Pacific time zones, NBC airs the prerecorded live show usually unedited, mistakes notwithstanding.\n\nSince the first opening in 1975 with Michael O\'Donoghue, Chevy Chase, and John Belushi, the show has normally begun with a cold open sketch which ends with one or more cast members breaking character and proclaiming \"Live from New York, it\'s Saturday Night!\", segueing into the opening credits that start immediately after.[3]\n\nIn February 2013, NBC began airing shortened hour-long repeats on Saturday evenings at 10:00p.m. Eastern Time during the regular season; the episodes scheduled are sometimes rebroadcasts of the previous week\'s episode if it originally aired as a first-run broadcast.[129] During the 201415 season, however, the prime time rebroadcasts consisted of a selection of 40 episodes from throughout the show\'s run under the title SNL Vintage to commemorate the program\'s 40th anniversary.\n\nNBC and Broadway Video both hold the underlying rights to the show, while the copyright to every episode lies solely with NBC. From 1990 until 2004, and again since 2015, Comedy Central and its predecessor Ha! re-aired reruns of the series, after which E! Entertainment Television signed a deal to carry reruns.[130] Abbreviated 30- and 60-minute versions of the first five seasons aired as The Best of Saturday Night Live in syndication beginning in the 1980s, and later on Nick at Nite in 1988. In September 2010, reruns of most episodes made from 1998 onward began airing on VH1.[131] Starting in February 2016, VH1 and Comedy Central\'s sister channel Logo began airing reruns of the show on Sunday nights, launching its broadcast as counterprogramming for Super Bowl 50 and branding it the \"Live From New York, It\'s Satur-Gay Night!\" marathon. The reruns are mostly from 2006 onward.\n\nBecause SNL has been a huge success in America, channels in other countries have created their own versions of the show, including in the Middle East and North Africa region, Germany, Spain, South Korea, Japan, Canada, Finland and France.[132][133]\n\nSNL is also aired in the Middle East and North Africa, OSN First HD every Saturday night, one week after it airs in the U.S.[134]\n\nIn India and Sri Lanka, Saturday Night Live! airs on Comedy Central, in an hour long version, one week after the U.S broadcast.[135]\n\nSpain\'s version of the show was short-lived, only lasting a few episodes which aired on Thursdays and not Saturdays as the title suggested. This version copied heavily from the American version, in that they did their own versions of sketches that were already done on the original series.[132] Italy\'s Saturday Night Live From Milan aired for four seasons and used original material.[132][136]\n\nOn December 3, 2011, South Korea\'s SNL Korea premiered on cable channel tvN.[137][138][139][140] As of July 20, 2013, it is in its fourth consecutive season, with 20 episodes.[141]\n\nThe Japanese version Saturday Night Live JPN, which ran for six months in 2011, was created in part with Lorne Michaels\' production company, Coca-Cola, Broadway Video and broadcast on Fuji TV networks. The show followed the same format with a few minor differences, being only 45 minutes long and hosted by a permanent host. The cast was made up of seasoned comedians who take center stage and newcomers who play the background roles. It was broadcast once a month, and ended after six episodes, as planned from the start.[132][136][142][143][144][excessive citations]\n\nIn 2014, two 90-minute specials were broadcast in French on Tl-Qubec in the Canadian province of Quebec under the title SNL Qubec; the specials were broadcast on February 8 and March 22, 2014. hosted by Louis-Jos Houde and Stphane Rousseau, and is the same format and length as the original SNL series.[145] Certain sketches from the original program, such as Debbie Downer and Schweddy Balls, were adapted into French, while other sketches were original material written directly for the Quebec series. On May 13, 2014, SNL Quebec was renewed for another eight episodes to be broadcast monthly over the 201415 season ending with a \"Best of\" compilation.[146] Tl-Qubec announced in May 2015 that the series would not be renewed due to funding cutbacks,[147] and Tlvision de Radio-Canada subsequently signed the show\'s production team and cast to produce a new series, Le nouveau show, for that network.[148]\n\nThe French channel M6 launched the pilot episode of its SNL adaptation, Le Saturday Night Live, in January 2017.\n\nThe episode scheduled for October 25, 1986, hosted by Rosanna Arquette, was not aired until November 8 due to NBC broadcasting Game 6 of the 1986 World Series between the New York Mets and Boston Red Sox; the game entered extra innings, causing that night\'s broadcast of SNL to be canceled. The show was recorded for the studio audience starting at 1:30a.m. Eastern Time, and broadcast two weeks later with an \"apology\" by Mets pitcher Ron Darling.[149]\n\nThe episode scheduled for February 10, 2001, hosted by Jennifer Lopez, aired 45 minutes late due to an XFL game. Lopez and the cast were not told they were airing on a delay. Michaels was so upset by the delay that the episode was rerun a mere three weeks later, and the fledgling league actually changed the rules in order to speed up play, and a deal was reached where the feed to future games would be cut off (whether the game had been decided or not) when SNL started so that no such incident would happen again.[150]\n\nIn 2002, SNL was ranked tenth on TV Guide\'s 50 Greatest TV Shows of All Time,[151] while in 2007 it was honored with inclusion on Time magazine\'s list of \"100 Best TV Shows of All-TIME.\"[128][152] In June 2013, the show was placed at number 25 on the list of the 101 best written shows of all time by the Writers Guild of America, assessing series from the previous 70 years.[153] In December 2013, TV Guide ranked it #18 on their list of the 60 Greatest Shows of All Time.[154] It is currently the 40th longest running TV show in the US.\n\nIn 2016, a New York Times study of the 50 TV shows with the most Facebook Likes found that SNL \"is very much an urban show. It\'s most popular in cities throughout the country, and college towns. Amherst, Mass.; Madison, Wis.; and Ithaca, N.Y. are all among the top 10\".[155]\n\nSaturday Night Live has won numerous awards since its debut, including 45 Primetime Emmy Awards,[156] 2 Peabody Awards,[157] and 4 Writers Guild of America Awards.[158] In 2009, it received a total of 13 Emmy nominations for a lifetime total of 126, breaking the record for the most award nominated show in Emmy history, previously set with 124 by hospital drama ER.[159][160] As of August 2012, it had received a record total of 156 Emmy nominations.[128][161]\n\n19 cast members have received individual Emmy nominations in the show\'s history. These nominations were mostly in the category of Individual Performance in a Variety or Music Program before that award was discontinued; since then, nominations have been in the Supporting Actor and Supporting Actress categories for comedy series. Of the 36 total nominations for these 19 performers, four have won Emmys: Chevy Chase (1976), Gilda Radner (1978), Dana Carvey (1993), and Kate McKinnon (2016).[156]\n\nSNL has also had an effect on U.S. elections  most commonly presidential elections. Voters have reported that political sketches that were shown on the program influenced them in the voting booth. The so-called SNL Effect was observed during the 2008 presidential campaign, according to Mike Dabadie. Two-thirds of voters who responded to a poll said they had seen a broadcast of politically charged content on SNL, with ten percent saying that it had made a difference in their decision. Barack Obama was the beneficiary of the political content, with 59 percent saying they did in fact cast a vote for the Democratic then-nominee.[162]\n\nChevy Chase\'s bumbling impression of then-president Gerald Ford during the 1976 presidential election was cited as an influence on the election, and a quote commonly attributed to 2008 vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin stating \"I can see Russia from my house\" was actually spoken by SNL cast member Tina Fey while portraying Palin.[163] Several politicians have appeared on SNL, including President Gerald Ford (in 1976, during the show\'s first season), then-Senator Barack Obama (2007), Senator John McCain (2002 & 2008), Senator Hillary Clinton (2008 & 2015), and Governor Sarah Palin (2008), who appeared alongside Fey\'s Palin impression, resulting in the show\'s largest audience in 14 years with 14 million viewers.[164][165] Senator Obama\'s appearance occurred in part because Hillary Clinton abandoned her scheduled appearance.[165] The political content was abandoned briefly following the September 11, 2001 terrorist attack in New York, with Poehler saying that the writers did not want to produce politicized material; highly political content would be absent for the next 4 years.[165]\n\nDue to the show\'s live factor, a number of technical problems, performer mishaps, intentional acts of sabotage by performers, protests, and cuts to dead air have occurred throughout the show\'s run. One incident that garnered widespread media coverage was the October 3, 1992 appearance by singer Sinad O\'Connor, in which she ripped up a photo of Pope John Paul II during her performance.[166][167] On April 13, 1996, the alternative metal band Rage Against the Machine made a statement about the host, billionaire Steve Forbes, by hanging two upside-down American flags from their amplifiers. On October 23, 2004, Ashlee Simpson appeared as a musical guest, and there was a lip synching mishap. Her first performance, \"Pieces of Me\", was performed without incident, but when she began her second song, \"Autobiography\", the vocals for \"Pieces of Me\" were heard again through the speakers, even before she had raised the microphone to her mouth. Simpson began to do an impromptu jig, and then left the stage.[168]\n\nCurrently, Universal Studios Home Entertainment and Lions Gate Entertainment hold video rights to the series. Universal has issued complete season DVD sets of the first few seasons, while Lionsgate\'s share of the rights are a result of prior contracts with NBC struck before the NBC Universal merger. A majority of Lionsgate\'s SNL DVDs are \"Best Of...\" compilations.\n\nSaturday Night Live (ISBN 0-380-01801-2), the first authorized book about the series, was published by Avon Books in 1977 and edited by Anne Beatts and John Head, with photography by Edie Baskin;[169] all three worked for SNL at the time the book was published. The oversized illustrated paperback included the scripts for several sketches by the 19751980 cast.[170] In 1986, Doug Hill and Jeff Weingrad authored Saturday Night: A Backstage History of Saturday Night Live (ISBN 0-688-05099-9), a behind-the-scenes look at the first ten seasons. Saturday Night Live: The First Twenty Years (ISBN 0-395-75284-1), by Michael Cader, was released in 1994, and presented information about the cast, characters, and other memorable moments seen on the show from 1975 to 1994.[171]\n\nLive From New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live, as Told By Its Stars, Writers and Guests (ISBN 0-316-73565-5) was released in 2002. The book, written by Tom Shales and James Andrew Miller, consists of interviews from people who have worked on the show. The interviews reveal personal experiences from what happened backstage and the difficulty of getting the show on air each week.[172] In 2004, former cast member Jay Mohr released his memoir Gasping for Airtime: Two Years in the Trenches of Saturday Night Live (ISBN 1-401-30801-5), about his struggles during his two seasons on the show between 1993 and 1995, dealing with getting sketches on air and the intense work schedule. Cast member Bobby Moynihan described the book as \"a handbook on what NOT to do at SNL.\"[173]\n\nSNL has made several efforts to develop some of the more popular sketches into feature-length films, with varying degrees of commercial and critical success. The first foray into film came with the successful Aykroyd and Belushi vehicle, The Blues Brothers (1980), which earned over $115 million on a $27 million budget.[174]\n\nIn 1990, Michaels oversaw the writing of a sketch anthology feature film titled The Saturday Night Live Movie with many of the show\'s then-current writing staff, including Al Franken, Tom Davis, Greg Daniels, Jim Downey, Conan O\'Brien, Robert Smigel, and George Meyer, contributing. The screenplay only got as far as a Revised First Draft dated July 26, 1990 before being abandoned.[175]\n\nHowever, it was the success of Wayne\'s World (1992) that encouraged Michaels to produce more film spin-offs, based on several popular sketch characters. Michaels revived 1970s characters for Coneheads (1993), followed by It\'s Pat (1994); Stuart Saves His Family (1995); A Night at the Roxbury (1998); Superstar (1999) and The Ladies Man (2000). Some did moderately well, though others did notnotably, It\'s Pat, which did so badly at the box office that the studio that made the film, Touchstone Pictures (owned by The Walt Disney Company, which also owns NBC\'s rival ABC), pulled it only one week after releasing it,[176] and Stuart Saves His Family, which lost $14 million. Many of these films were produced by Paramount Pictures. The films based on The Blues Brothers were produced by Universal Studios, which merged with NBC in 2004 to form NBC Universal (Universal also has a joint venture with Paramount for international distribution of the two studios\' films).\n\nThe character Bob Roberts from the Tim Robbins film of the same name (1992), first appeared on SNL in a short film about the conservative folk singer.\n\nIn addition, the 1999 comedy film Office Space originated from a series of animated short films by Mike Judge that aired on SNL in 1993.[178]\n\nThe fictitious American folk music trio The Folksmen first appeared on SNL, performing the song \"Old Joe\'s Place\" before later appearing in the film A Mighty Wind (2002). The three members of the Folksmen were the same three comedians: Harry Shearer, Michael McKean, and Christopher Guest, who also appeared on the same episode as the rock group Spinal Tap. At the time of the appearance (the 198485 season), Shearer and Guest were cast members.\n\nMr. Bill\'s Real Life Adventures is based off the Mr. Bill sketches from early seasons of SNL.[179][180]\n\nIn 2005, the comedy troupe The Lonely Island, consisting of SNL members Andy Samberg, Akiva Schaffer, and Jorma Taccone, gained national exposure after joining the show and debuting their comedic music video \"Lazy Sunday\", written with fellow cast member Chris Parnell. The song became a surprise hit,[181] and convinced Michaels to encourage the troupe to develop more comedy songs. Further successes with songs including \"Like A Boss, \"Jizz in My Pants\", \"I\'m on a Boat\", \"We Like Sportz\", \"Boombox\", and \"Dick in a Box\"which won an Emmy for Outstanding Original Music and Lyrics in 2007[182]saw The Lonely Island go on to release two albums, Incredibad (2009)[183] and Turtleneck & Chain (2011), containing SNL-developed songs and original works. The albums were released by Universal Republic Records who were provided with a license to the SNL songs by NBC and Broadway Video.\n\nA cast album was released in 1976 on the Arista label including the song \"Chevy\'s Girls\" and comedy bits from the show (\"Weekend Update\", \"Emily Litella\", \"Gun Control\"); it was later re-issued on CD and MP3 download.\n\nSeveral programs have documented the behind-the-scenes events of the show. A 60 Minutes report taped in October 2004 depicted the intense writing frenzy that goes on during the week leading up to a show, with crowded meetings and long hours. The report particularly noted the involvement of the guest host(s) in developing and selecting the sketches in which they will appear. Similarly, there has been an A&E episode of Biography which covered the production process, as well as an episode of TV Tales in 2002 on E!. In 2010, Saturday Night, a 94-minute documentary by actor James Franco in his directorial debut, was released; it follows the production process of the December 6, 2008, episode hosted by John Malkovich, from the concept stage to the episode actually airing live. Although it originated as a five-minute short film for Franco\'s New York University film class, Michaels granted Franco access to the process, allowing the project to be expanded.[111] On February 15, 2015, NBC aired a 3 1/2 hour special on Saturday Night Live\'s 40th anniversary. The program included a mix of clips, new performances of classic characters from previous cast members and special guest appearances from previous hosts.[184]\n\nIn September 2011, ice cream company Ben & Jerry\'s released a limited-edition ice cream called \"Schweddy Balls\", inspired by a 1998 sketch of the same name starring Alec Baldwin, Ana Gasteyer and Molly Shannon.[185] The ice cream became the fastest-selling Ben & Jerry\'s limited-edition flavor. The ice cream was also subject to criticism and boycotts by the One Million Moms organization over the \"vulgar\"[186] name. Some retail chains chose not to sell the flavor, but declined to say if the decision was at their own discretion or based on the One Million Moms boycotts.[186][187] In June 2014, two new flavours inspired by SNL sketches were introducedLazy Sunday, based on a sketch of the same name featuring Andy Samberg and Chris Parnell, and Gilly\'s Catastrophic Crunch based on the recurring Gilly sketches featuring Kristen Wiig.[188] Two Wild and Crazy Pies, based on the catchphrase of the recurring Festrunk Brothers, was introduced in September 2014,[189] followed by Wayne\'Swirled inspired by the eponymous Wayne\'s World in February 2015.[190]','2017-03-25 03:51:12'),(135,19,'14ab2d03f02765c0aed051e4d1338a3fae563579378deae7135f598bca0c0316','0ed30ec4f8104d56b3c3903834f98db7','','','Media Lifes programming blog tracks the latest cancellations, renewals and programming moves on the broadcast and cable networks as well as subscription video-on-demand services.\n\nDec. 19: Its official: There will be an eighth season of Shameless.\n\nShowtime has renewed the drama after a pay dispute with leading actress Emmy Rossum.

Though it has posted low numbers (averaging a 1.0 adults 18-49 rating, down more than 25 percent from last season), it could still have an outside shot of making it to a fourth season.\n\nThe show did much better with a stronger lead-in, airing behind The Big Bang Theory and Mom in its first two seasons.\n\nNov. 28: Quantico was one of ABCs successes last season, but the show has seen big live-viewing declines this fall.\n\nThe network is hoping that a new night can help revive the show, and also patch a hole in this falls schedule.\n\nStarting in 2017, Quantico will move from Sundays at 10 to Mondays at 10, replacing Conviction, which is finishing out its initial order but wont receive any more episodes.\n\nQuantico has averaged a 0.8 live-plus-same-day adults 18-49 rating this season, according to Nielsen, down from a 1.2 in its first season.\n\nThe show, which more than doubles that L+SD average with DVR viewing added in, will get a much better lead-in from Dancing with the Stars.\n\nMeanwhile, in other programming:\n\n* CBS has lined up a new competition show, Hunted, in which people go on the run and try to avoid capture by professional investigators, that will bow Jan. 22 at 10 p.m., right after the AFC championship game.

The show originally aired on A&E and moved to Netflix after it was canceled.\n\nNov. 1: NBC wants more time with Timeless.\n\nThe network has picked up three additional episodes of the new drama, bringing its season order to 16.\n\nThats not quite the 22 episodes that most full-season pickups consist of, but it signals the network is still interested in the show if not fully committed.

But its definitely not going to be around much longer.\n\nABC has slashed the order for new drama Notorious from 13 to 10 episodes, according to The Hollywood Reporter.\n\nThe show has averaged a 1.0 adults 18-49 rating, according to Nielsen. While its seeing strong DVR playback, its losing more than half of its lead-in from Greys Anatomy, which ABC cant afford.\n\nThe networks have become more reluctant to outright cancel shows in this era of ratings declines.

The article claimed that given the shows politically-charged content, it had simply fallen flat. It purported:\n\nAfter 40 years of successful ratings, springboarding dozens of careers of comedic brilliance to super-stardom, Saturday Night Live has fallen flat. By forgetting that its a comedy variety show and not a leftist propaganda outlet, the shows writers and actors have doomed it to oblivion. NBC released a statement this morning announcing that due to the lowest ratings of all time and the highest number of viewer complaints and general discourse from the American public, this will be the final season of Saturday Night Live: The American people have spoken. Saturday night live, through its divisive skits and hate speech towards our president, has alienated more than 70 percent of its viewers. The ratings are so low that advertisers have refused to continue their relationships with the show and some have threatened to leave NBC altogether.\n\nIn reality, Saturday Night Live, which has a long history of mocking presidents, has seen an increase in its ratings thanks to Trump, actor Alec Baldwin and the rest of the Saturday Night Live cast. The Feb. 11 episode, which featured Baldwin as Trump, Kate McKinnon as counselor Kellyanne Conway and Melissa McCarthy as press secretary Sean Spicer, gave the show their highest overnight ratings in six years. According to Entertainment Weekly, the show is on track to have its highest-rated season in 22 years.\n\nTrump has repeatedly criticized Baldwin and Saturday Night Live for their political sketches. According to Time, Trump suggested last year that the show would be canceled, saying, Frankly, the way the show is going now who knows how long that show is going to be on? Its a terrible show. He has previously referred to the show as boring and unfunny, unwatchable and totally biased.\n\nDid you see the fake story about Saturday Night Live getting canceled circulating social media?

All articles should be considered satirical and any and all quotes attributed to actual people complete and total baloney. Pictures that represent actual people should be considered altered and not in any way real.\n\nIn addition to the satirical origins of this story, the claim that Saturday Night Live has sunk to its lowest ratings in history during its 42 season is demonstrably false. Although Vulture noted that directly comparing the current seasons ratings for SNL to those of years past is problematic due to the fact that Nielsens rating mechanisms have changed since the show first aired in 1975, the comedy show has seen a viewer surge during the 2016-17 season, due in large part to the popularity of the programs political skewerings of President Trump and his administration:\n\nWhile historical comparisons using total-viewer data is a bit tricky given population growth and the advent of time-shifting technology about a decade ago, the audience surge for SNL is impressive from almost any angle. A more precise measurement of SNLs Trumpian surge is probably its ratings among adults under 50. This stat isnt skewed by population growth (since it represents the percentage of the overall young-adult audience watching), and its also the rating used most frequently by NBC to sell advertising on the show. Including DVR replays, SNL this season is notching around a 3.5 rating in the demo, up an eye-popping 20 percent versus this point last season. Assuming these numbers hold, the show (as of last week) is on track to have its best performance among young adults since the 200708 season, when interest in the Democratic and Republican presidential primaries drove tune-in and boosted SNL to a 4.3 demo rating. While not quite as flashy as saying SNL is having its best season in two decades, its the sort of performance thats making NBCs ad sales force very, very happy  and no doubt making the man most responsible for the ratings spike  wait for it  very, very sad!','2017-03-25 03:51:12'),(142,20,'19c1b3fdea241c7c7331d916912624baf8a638834898ca799c0a9e146e560944','6677f992a23f410e8edd717ce1ea7fd9','','','Betty White is not dead, despite some homophoneconfusion that sparked rumors and RIPs on social media.\n\n\"Actress Betty White, 92, dyes peacefully in her Los Angeles home\" read a headline published Wednesday on the satirical website Empire News.\n\nThe story, which purported to quote the actress\' agent, was a tongue-in-cheek piece about White not being a natural blond.\n\nLong story short: Readers got confused by the fake news and even more so by the wordplay in the headline, and suddenly her name was trending nationally and mournfully on Twitter.\n\nWhite\'s agent, Jeff Witjas, assured the Los Angeles Times that the actress was alive and well.\n\n\"She is on the set shooting \'Hot in Cleveland\' right now,\" he said.','2017-03-25 03:51:12'),(143,20,'19c1b3fdea241c7c7331d916912624baf8a638834898ca799c0a9e146e560944','07d286eb0e2845249a0cc1329713855b','','','Comedian Betty White, age 94, best known for her parts on The Golden Girls, and Hot in Cleveland, is alive and kicking.

In fact, rumors about their supposedly imminent divorce have circulated publicly at least since 2010 when The National Enquirer tabloid published an unsubstantiated story that the Obama marriage was about to disintegrate.\n\nThe publisher of The National Enquirer, David Pecker, is a longtime, close personal friend of Donald Trump, and during the Republican primary campaign, the checkout-counter tabloid published several unsubstantiated stories attacking Trumps Republican rival, Texas Senator Ted Cruz. The paper alleged that Cruz had conducted extramarital affairs with five different women and that Cruzs father, Rafael Cruz, had taken part in the assassination of President John F. Kennedy in 1963.\n\nIn 2012, conservative author Ed Klein published a book about Obama titled The Amateur: Barack Obama in the White House, in which he alleged that during Obamas losing 2000 campaign for congress in Illinois, tensions ran so high between the couple that they contemplated divorce.\n\nIn 2013, the Enquirer was at it again, claiming that Barack Obama had flirted with Caroline Kennedy, daughter of the slain president, which so enraged Michelle that she sought a divorce.\n\nAgain, the rumors had no basis.\n\nKlein is also the author of books attacking Hillary and Bill Clinton, including Guilty as Sin: Uncovering New Evidence of Corruption and How Hillary Clinton and the Democrats Derailed the FBI Investigation, UNLIKEABLE: The Problem with Hillary, and Blood Feud: The Clintons vs. the Obamas.\n\nIn 2014, the Pecker-run tabloid tried again, claiming that a team of private investigators had compiled documents proving that Barack Obama had engaged in extramarital relationships. But that story again went nowhere, and the secret divorce file never turned up in public, if, in fact, it existed at all which appears unlikely.\n\nBut in February of this year, about a month after the Obama couple departed the White House after serving eight years as president and first lady, a new rumor circulated online.\n\nAccording to the most recent Obama divorce scuttlebutt, it was Barack Obama who filed for divorce against Michelle, filing papers in an Illinois court after learning of his wifes marital infidelity.\n\nBut the latest rumor proved even more insubstantial the the previous divorce rumors around Barack and Michelle Obama. Snopes.com reporters combed the court database in Cook County, Illinois, turning up no evidence that either Obama had filed for divorce  evidence that would be public record and easily accessible if it existed.\n\nSnopes found that, in fact, the latest Obama divorce rumor originated with a satirical fake news website, The Resistance: Last Line of Defense.\n\nA quick reading of the article should have tipped off any reader that the story was intended in humor.\n\nThe infidelity, according to the Obamas longtime housekeeper, Analita Consuelo Gonsales, isnt recent but rather the revelation through a recent DNA test that Obama isnt the biological father of Sasha or Malia, the site wrote.\n\nThe tongue-in-cheek nature of those assertions is likely to be obvious to most readers.\n\nThe couple who took the places of Barack and Michelle Obama has yet to occupy the White House as a couple. Melania Trump, wife of Donald Trump and now first lady, has remained in the couples New York City lavish Trump Tower apartment for the first month of her husbands term at a cost of up to $146,000 per day to U.S taxpayers, for her security measures.\n\nMORE BARACK OBAMA COVERAGE FROM THE INQUISITR:\n\n Barack Obama As French President?

She took the bar exam in Illinois, passing it on her second try and receiving her license from the state of Illinois.\n\nIn 1988, Michelle became an associate at Sidley & Austin, a corporate law firm in her home town of Chicago. She was assigned to mentor summer associate and future husband, Barack Obama.\n\nShe remained at the law firm for three years, leaving the lucrative practice and corporate law behind in 1991 upon her fathers death. According to the Washington Post, Sidley & Austin offered Barack Obama a job upon his graduation from Harvard, but the future president declined  even though he planned on returning to Chicago. He explained that he wanted to go into politics and that Michelle would be leaving the firm to go with him.\n\nAccording to the New York Times, Michelle was unfulfilled by her law career. She told the newspaper, I wanted to have a career motivated by passion and not just money.\n\nShe elaborated in an interview with Newsweek: I didnt see a whole lot of people who were just thrilled to be there, she said. I met people who thought this was a good life. But were people waking up just bounding out of bed to get to work? No.\n\nIn 1991, Michelle wrote to Valerie Jarrett, then-deputy chief of staff for Chicago Mayor Richard Daley. Jarrett offered her a job as an assistant to the mayor, a position that offered $60,000 a year. When Jarrett was promoted to head the Department of Planning and Development, Michelle became an economic development coordinator, responsible for developing strategies and negotiating business agreements to promote and stimulate economic growth within the City of Chicago.\n\nMichelle and Obama married in 1992 at Trinity United Church of Christ, in a ceremony officiated by Rev. Jeremiah Wright.\n\nIn 1993, Michelle left the mayors office and became executive director for the Chicago office of Public Allies, a taxpayer-funded organization that encourages young activists and places them in positions for nonprofit groups and government agencies. Barack Obama was a member of the groups founding advisory board.\n\nPublic Allies promises to help adults, ages 18 to 30, find community leadership positions and attend weekly training workshops and retreats. Recruits receive a monthly stipend of up to $1,800, plus paid health and child care and an additional award of $4,725 to pay for student loans or college tuition.\n\nAccording to Investors Business Daily, the program promotes diversity and inclusion and boasts that more than 70 percent of its recruits are people of color.\n\nWhen theyre not protesting, theyre staffing AIDS clinics, handing out condoms, bailing criminals out of jail and helping illegal aliens and the homeless obtain food stamps and other welfare, Investors Business Daily states.\n\nOne member of the 2005 Los Angeles class told IBD, It was too touchy-feely. Its a lot of talk about race, a lot of talk about sexism, a lot of talk about homophobia, talk about -isms and phobias.\n\nAccording to the report, one of those -isms is heterosexism. The Chicago-based Public Allies training seminar describes it as a negative result of capitalism, white supremacy, patriarchy and male-dominated privilege.\n\nThe IBD report calls it a boot camp for radicals who hate the military.\n\nMichelle Obama worked at Public Allies from spring 1993 until fall 1996 and served on its national board of directors from 1997 until 2001. She said, The happiest time of my life was working to build Public Allies.\n\nOn the campaign trail with her husband last year, Michelle touted her choice to give up a lucrative legal career for community service.\n\nWe left corporate America, which is a lot of what were asking young people to do, she said. Dont go into corporate America. You know, become teachers. Work for the community. Be social workers. Be a nurse. Those are the careers that we need, and were encouraging our young people to do that.\n\nIn 1993, the same year she began working for Public Allies, she applied to change her Illinois registration status for practicing law  only four years after she received her license. It is now listed as inactive.\n\nJames Grogan, deputy administrator and chief counsel for the Attorney Registration and Disciplinary Commission of the Supreme Court of Illinois, or ARDC, has been with the commission for 30 years. He told WND that on July 1, 1994, the Illinois Supreme Court entered an order allowing Michelle to be transferred to inactive status pursuant to Illinois Supreme Court rule 770.\n\nThe ARDC website explains, Prior to November 1, 1999, former Supreme Court Rule 770 provided for a proceeding in the Court for any voluntary transfer to inactive status, whether because of some incapacitating condition or solely as a matter of the lawyers preference because the lawyer would not be practicing law.\n\nGrogan explained, At the time, the only way to go on inactive status was to do what she did  which was to file a petition in the Illinois Supreme Court.\n\nHe said attorneys often filed a petition for 770 when they wanted to pursue other careers, retire or begin raising a family.\n\nAt the time, this happened all the time, he said. Our office would have to file whats known as a consent.\n\nGrogan said his office would have immediately alerted the court in a public filing if there had been reason to believe she should face disciplinary action.\n\nWe filed a consent in Michelle Obamas case in which we had no objection to her transferring to inactive status, he said. In the event that she did go on inactive status and she engaged in any disbarrable offenses, there would be a disciplinary case of public record.\n\nHe continued, Just because someone goes on inactive it doesnt deprive us of the jurisdiction to prosecute.\n\nInundated by numerous 770 filings that each required a separate court ruling, the Illinois Supreme Court later simplified the inactivation process. In 2005, after Barack Obama was elected to the U.S. Senate, he changed his status to inactive as well.\n\nBy 2005, which is several years later than his wife, the rule had changed such that you no longer had to file a petition that was such a pain for the court, Grogan explained. Instead, the court had changed it to two types of status: inactive or retired. Either situation involves merely sending a letter to us basically saying, I want to transfer to inactive status.\'\n\nActive lawyers are required to pay $289 each year and take 30 hours of Continuing Legal Education, or CLE, every two years. Under inactive status, attorneys are not required to take the courses, but they must pay $105 each year. Inactive registrants are not authorized to practice law. Lawyers who retire do not have to pay fees or take courses.\n\nA lot of people who arent practicing say, Why bother?\' Grogan said.\n\nBarack Obama remained listed as inactive until he retired this year.\n\nIf you are currently inactive and want to get back in, all you have to do is send us a letter and pay the current balance of your registration, Grogan said. However, if youre retired and want to come back in, you have to pay the full registration fee for the years you were out. I dont think Obamas going to come back to Chicago to practice, you know what I mean?\n\nIn the case of Michelle Obama, Grogan said she would need to obtain another court order to reactivate her status because her file still falls under old rules that required her to go through the court for all status changes. He called her 1993 petition unremarkable, saying there is no reason to believe her standing was in question.\n\nTheres absolutely no indication of any disciplinary proceeding ever lodged against Michelle Obama, he said.\n\nIn June 1996, she was named associate dean of student services at the University of Chicago. In 2002, she began working for the University of Chicago Hospitals, eventually earning $317,000 a year after her husband became a senator. She scaled back her responsibilities to support Barack Obamas presidential campaign\n\nThe White House declined to respond to questions about the status of her license. Michelle Obama has not revealed exactly what prompted her to change her status to inactive or whether she plans to ever practice law again.','2017-03-25 03:51:12'),(154,21,'1a0f1694cb65044a84a6219fbaf4dd39f0f48da0087a02ccce65cba993222d4b','27d5f8fc9fd84ad395540e91ced0eeca','','','Michelle Obama had warned her husband not to run, but he ignored her advice and ran anyway.

And I told him it was really okay and not a put down of the Muslim part of his family or his Muslim friends. \n\n\n\nMr Obama was supposedly known as Black Jesus by his former senior campaign adviser David Axelrod because of his messiah complex, Mr Klein writes. \n\n\n\nHe also had a run-in with Steven Rogers, a wealthy businessman who became the Gund Family Distinguished Professor of Entrepreneurship at Northwestern Universitys Kellogg School of Management. \n\n\n\nEarly in his campaign for the U.S. Senate he gave Mr Obama $3,000 and arranged for thousands more dollars to be donated to him on one condition: he come and speak at the school when he got elected. \n\n\n\nAfter becoming a Senator Mr Obama is said to have gone back on his offer because he was too busy and told Mr Rogers: Come on man, you should know better when politicians make promises. \n\n\n\nIn a furious tirade Mr Rogers screamed at him: Youre a dirty rotten m*****f*****. What kind of s*** are you trying to pull? F*** you, you big-eared m*****f*****. \n\n\n\nA year later Mr Obama finally showed up but by then Mr Rogers had all but written him off as a friend. \n\n\n\nIn extracts which had already been made public Mr Klein claims that Mrs Obama is so jealous of her husband receiving female attention she orders women who are close to him in the White House to be watched. \n\n\n\nThe First Lady is supposedly paranoid Mr Obama will cheat on her as John F Kennedy did to his wife. \n\n\n\nIn the book he adds more detail and claims when Mr Obama was studying at Harvard as a law student she would fly into jealous rages when she saw him with other women. \n\n\n\nShe was supposedly so territorial that she drove a lot of Baracks friends away, Mr Klein writes. \n\n\n\nThe only reason they got married at all was that Mrs Obama insisted upon it - because she wanted to remake him as she wanted and not let him have an easy life. \n\n\n\nThe book claims that once her husband assumed office she began to wield power behind the scenes to such an extent that Mr Obama shares a co-presidency with her. \n\n\n\nMr Klein also alleges that Mr Obama twice snubbed Caroline Kennedy, the daughter of former U.S. President John F Kennedy, and that he and Mrs Obama privately made disparaging comments about her family - and even their clothes. \n\n\n\nHe writes: Caroline heard there was a lot of nasty s**** being said about the Kennedys by the president and Michelle. \n\n\n\nThere were catty remarks about how badly the Kennedy women dressed and how their houses were shabby and threadbare. \n\n\n\nCaroline got the impression that most of this negativity was coming from Michelle, who didnt want the Kennedys to be part of the administration for fear that they would have too much influence over the president. \n\n\n\nAmong others who were also shut out of the White House were Oprah Winfrey who Mr Klein claims was given the cold shoulder for being too fat. \n\n\n\nThe title of the book comes from a supposed outburst last August by former U.S. President Bill Clinton who branded Mr Obama an amateur. \n\n\n\nHe also urged his wife Hillary to quit her post as U.S. Secretary of State and challenge Mr Obama for the Democratic ticket in this years elections, telling her: Your country needs you! Your country needs us! \n\n\n\nThe White House has denounced the book and said that Mr Klein has a record for making things up. \n\n\n\nMr Clinton has also denied he insulted the President. \n\n','2017-03-25 03:51:12'),(156,21,'1a0f1694cb65044a84a6219fbaf4dd39f0f48da0087a02ccce65cba993222d4b','becc5bf175ce4fe9b3fb49634a775e0c','','','Late last week, a rumor began circulating in Washington social circles that there was trouble in paradise for Barack and Michelle Obama. While there was no confirmation, it was being tossed around that it was Barack looking to dump Michelle. This morning, a filing in the District Court of Cook County, Illinois confirmed that the couple is seeking divorce and that Barack is, in fact, the plaintiff.\n\nAccording to county docket D4610968L86, Barack Hussein Obama seeks dissolution of marriage from Michelle Obama on grounds of infidelity and irreconcilable differences. The infidelity, according to the Obamas longtime housekeeper, Analita Consuelo Gonsales, isnt recent but rather the revelation through a recent DNA test that Obama isnt the biological father of Sasha or Malia.\n\nGonsales said that it wasnt really a surprise, because during an argument in 2003 Barack admitted to Michelle that he had faked all of his orgasms. Michelle, in turn, admitted that she had an affair with a biolab and that the children were actually the product of advanced genetic engineering. Apparently, Malia is secretly one of the most talented dulcimer musicians in the world and Sashas IQ is so high shes a single lab accident away from being a supervillain and taking over the world.\n\nObama, who suddenly feels like an outcast in a family of such amazing people, will step aside and even back Michelles 2020 run for president, but he will not agree to paying any form of support for Sasha, who is still a minor, mostly because she makes more money playing Texas Hold em in a month than he makes in a year.\n\nIts lucky for us that we dont have to have this kind of craziness in our White House anymore.

Watched over by three aides and Gilbert Stuarts portrait of George Washington, the two sat a few feet apart in matching striped chairs that made them look more like a pair of heads of state than husband and wife. The Obamas were talking about the impact of the presidency on their relationship, and doing so in that setting  we were in the room that epitomizes official power, discussing the highly unofficial matter of dates  began to seem like a metaphor for the topic itself.\n\nIf I werent president, I would be happy to catch the shuttle with my wife to take her to a Broadway show, as I had promised her during the campaign, and there would be no fuss and no muss and no photographers, the president said. That would please me greatly. He went on to say: The notion that I just couldnt take my wife out on a date without it being a political issue was not something I was happy with.\n\nEverything becomes political here, I offered, gesturing around the room.\n\nEverything becomes political, he repeated very slowly. Then he said: What I value most about my marriage is that it is separate and apart from a lot of the silliness of Washington, and Michelle is not part of that silliness.\n\nPerhaps she is not. But the Obamas mix politics and romance in a way that no first couple quite have before. Almost 10 months ago, they swept into Washington with inauguration festivities that struck distinctly wedding-like notes: he strode down an aisle and took a vow, she wore a long white dress, the youthful-looking couple swayed to a love song in a ceremonial first dance and then settled into a new house. Since then, photograph after official White House photograph has shown the Obamas gazing into each others eyes while performing one or another official function. Here is a shot of the Obamas entering a Cinco de Mayo reception, his arm draped protectively around her back. Next, a photo of the president placing a kiss on his wifes cheek after his address on health care to Congress. Poster-size versions of these and other photographs are displayed in rotation along the White House corridors. Its hard to think of another workplace decorated with such looming evidence of affection between the principal players.\n\nThe centrality of the Obama marriage to the presidents political brand opens a new chapter in the debate that has run through, even helped define, their union. Since he first began running for office in 1995, Barack and Michelle Obama have never really stopped struggling over how to combine politics and marriage: how to navigate the long absences, lack of privacy, ossified gender roles and generally stultifying rules that result when public opinion comes to bear on private relationships.\n\nAlong the way, they revised some of the standards for how a politician and spouse are supposed to behave. They have spoken more frankly about marriage than most intact couples, especially those running for office, usually do. (The bumps happen to everybody all the time, and they are continuous, the first lady told me in a lets-get-real voice, discussing the lowest point in her marriage.) Candidates wives are supposed to sit cheerfully through their husbands appearances. But after helping run her husbands first State Senate campaign in 1996, Michelle Obama largely withdrew from politics for years, fully re-engaging only for the presidential campaign. As a result, she has probably logged fewer total sitting-through-my-husbands-speech hours than most of her recent predecessors. Even the go-for-broke quality of the presidents rise can be read, in some small part, as an attempt to vault over the forces that fray political marriages. People who face too many demands  two careers, two children  often scale back somehow. The Obamas scaled up.\n\nThis is the first time in a long time in our marriage that weve lived seven days a week in the same household with the same schedule, with the same set of rituals, Michelle Obama pointed out. (Until last November they had not shared a full-time roof since 1996, two years before Malia was born.) Thats been more of a relief for me than I would have ever imagined.\n\nThe couple now spend more time together than at nearly any other point since their early years together. On many days, they see Malia and Sasha off to school, exercise together and do not begin their public schedules until 9 or even 10 oclock. They recently finished redecorating the White House residence, the first lady requesting an outdoor rocking chair for her husband to read in, the president scrutinizing colors and patterns, said Desire Rogers, the White House social secretary. The pair recently began playing tennis. (He wins, she admitted; for now, he added.) This summer, the first lady surprised her husband for his birthday by gathering his old basketball buddies for a weekend at Camp David.\n\nBarack and Michelle Obama are also a more fully fused political team than ever before, with no other jobs to distract them, no doubts about the worthiness of the pursuit dogging them. Theirs is by no means a co-presidency; aides say the first lady has little engagement with banking reform, nuclear disarmament or most of the other issues that dominate her husbands days. But their goals are increasingly intertwined, with Michelle Obama speaking out on health care reform, privately mulling over Supreme Court nominees with the president and serving as his consultant on personnel and public opinion. When they lounge on the Truman Balcony or sit inside at their round dining table, she describes how she believes his initiatives are perceived outside Washington; later, say advisers, the president quotes the first lady in Oval Office meetings.\n\nIf winning the White House represents a resolution of the Obamas struggles, it also means a new, higher-stakes confrontation with some of the vexing issues that fed those tensions. Their marriage is more vulnerable than ever to the corrosions of politics: partisan attacks, disappointments of failed initiatives, a temptation to market what was once wholly private. Some of the methods the Obamas devised for keeping their relationship strong  speaking frankly in public, maintaining separate careers, even date nights  are no longer as easily available to them. Like every other modern presidential couple, the Obamas have watched their world contract to one building and a narrow zone beyond, and yet their partnership expand to encompass a staff and two wings of the White House. And while the presidency tends to bring couples closer, historians say, it also tends to thrust them back to more traditionbound behavior.\n\nFor all of their ease in public, the Obamas do not seem entirely comfortable with the bargain. As they talked about their marriage, they seemed both game and cautious, the president more introspective about their relationship, the first lady often playing the big sister dispensing advice to younger couples.\n\nThen I asked how any couple can have a truly equal partnership when one member is president.\n\nMichelle Obama gave what sounded like a small, sharp mmphf of recognition, and the fluid teamwork of their answers momentarily came to a halt. Well, first of all. . . . the president started. His wife peered at him, looking curious as to how he might answer the question. Shes got. . . . he began, but then stopped again.\n\nWell, let me be careful about this, he said, pausing once more.\n\nMy staff worries a lot more about what the first lady thinks than they worry about what I think, he finally said, to laughter around the room.\n\nThe question still unanswered, his wife stepped back in: Clearly Baracks career decisions are leading us. Theyre not mine; thats obvious. Im married to the president of the United States. I dont have another job, and it would be problematic in this role. So that  you cant even measure that. She did add that they are more equal in their private lives  how they run their household, how they raise their children, the overall choices they make.\n\nInterpreting anyones marriage  a neighbors, let alone the presidents  is extremely difficult. And yet examining the first couples relationship  their negotiations of public and private life, of conflicts and compromises  offers hints about Barack Obama the president, not just Barack Obama the husband. Long before many Americans, Michelle Obama was seduced by his mind, his charm, his promise of social transformation; long before he held national office, she questioned whether he really could deliver on all his earnest pledges. For nearly two decades, Michelle Obama has lived with the president of the United States. Now the rest of us do, too.\n\nJUST BEFORE THE Rev. Jeremiah A. Wright Jr. pronounced Barack Obama and Michelle Robinson man and wife on the evening of Oct. 3, 1992, he held their wedding rings  signifying their new, enduring bonds  before the guests at Trinity United Church of Christ. Michelles was traditional, but Baracks was an intricate gold design from Indonesia, where he had lived as a boy.\n\nNeither needed a reminder of just how fragile family  the black family, marriage, life itself  could be. Barack Obama Sr.s relationships, not just with his wives but also with his children, were fleeting; in 1982, he died at the age of 46. Michelles parents had a long, stable marriage, but her maternal grandparents split without ever formally divorcing, and her paternal grandparents separated for 11 years.\n\nBefore Michelle, Barack had brought only one woman to Hawaii to meet his family, according to his younger half-sister, Maya Soetoro. He in turn was Michelles first serious boyfriend, according to Craig Robinson, Michelles brother: none of the others had met her standards.\n\nDuring their three-year courtship, the couple shared thrilling moments, like when Barack became the first black president of the Harvard Law Review. But there were crushing ones too. In early 1991, Fraser Robinson, Michelles father, came down with what seemed to be the flu. Just a few days later, he was brain-dead, and his family had to decide whether to end life support, according to Francesca Gray, his sister. Barack was in the middle of classes, with no money to speak of, but he flew to Chicago anyway. At the wedding the following year, Craig Robinson took his fathers place in walking Michelle down the aisle.\n\nThe Obamas were married just a month before the presidential election, a time of mounting excitement for Democrats in their neighborhood of Hyde Park and beyond. Bill Clinton looked as if he might take the White House back from Republicans. Barack was helping by running a voter-registration drive so successful that he won notice in Chicago newspapers and political circles. (Clinton ended up carrying Illinois, then a tossup state.) Obamas efforts also helped make Carol Moseley Braun, a fellow Hyde Park resident, the first African-American woman in the U.S. Senate. Suddenly politics seemed full of new possibilities. Barack had talked to Michelle about running for office; she had misgivings but thought the day was not imminent.\n\nFor the moment, he was enmeshed in writing his memoir, Dreams From My Father. He had retreated to Bali for several weeks to work on the manuscript and was still preoccupied with it after his return. Barack was just really involved in the book. [Michelle] and I would do lots of shopping and movies, Yvonne Davila, still a close friend, remembered.\n\nBarack doesnt belong to you, she told me she warned Michelle.\n\nIN THE ANNALS of presidential coupledom, the Obamas more than slightly resemble the Clintons: a pair of Ivy League-trained lawyers, the self-made son of an absent father and a wife who sometimes put her husbands ambitions ahead of her own. But unlike Bill Clinton, who turned his wife into an unlikely Arkansan, Obama planted himself on his wifes turf. And while the Clinton marriage seems forged in shared beliefs about the promise of politics, the Obama union has been a decades-long debate about whether politics could be an effective avenue for social change. Even as a community organizer, Barack aimed to prod elected officials into action. His wife, who was more skeptical of politicians, tried to bypass them: when she took a job promoting community-organizing techniques, she focused on what neighborhoods could accomplish without their help.\n\nIn 1995, a State Senate seat was opening up, and Barack, then 34, announced his candidacy. It allowed me to get my feet wet in politics and test out whether I could get something done, he told The Times two years ago. Because he wasnt from Chicago, had degrees from two elite schools and a background that others found odd, a friend said, he felt he had to begin by running for a relatively modest office.\n\nAs the Obamas sat with friends around their dining room table, eating Michelles chili and planning the run, she was plainly hesitant. She was very open about not wanting to be in politics, Davila said. Michelle had always wanted to be a mother, three years had passed since their wedding and now her husband  with his all-consuming memoir just finished  would be gone several days a week. Michelle just wasnt ready to share, Carol Anne Harwell, who became the campaign manager, recalls. Besides, he was the former president of the Harvard Law Review, a writer and a teacher at a premier law school, the University of Chicago. Springfield was home to financial scandal so pervasive it was barely considered scandalous. I married you because youre cute and youre smart, Michelle later said she told her husband, but this is the dumbest thing you could have ever asked me to do.\n\nShe became his most energetic volunteer anyway. She did everything, Craig Robinson says. Every Saturday morning, she and Davila knocked on doors for petition signatures that would put Barack on the ballot.\n\nAs a first-time candidate, Barack could be stiff; friends remember him talking to voters with his arms folded, looking defensive. Michelle warmed everyone up, including her husband. She is really Bill, and he is really Hillary, one friend recently put it. But like Hillary Clinton  and countless other political wives  Michelle sometimes took on the role of enforcer. If a volunteer promised to gather 300 petition signatures, 299 did not work because 300 was the goal, Harwell says. You met the wrath of Michelle.\n\nHarwell also noticed that the candidates wife was constantly trying to upgrade the campaign, eliminating anything that seemed tacky or otherwise redolent of the less-than-exalted standards of Illinois state politics. Instead of a beers-in-a-bar fund-raiser, Michelle arranged a party at the DuSable Museum of African American History with a band and a crowd of young professionals. When Harwell found an inexpensive office space with dingy walls, Michelle vetoed it. She was like, Oh, no, no, no,  Harwell says.  Why would we reduce ourselves to this? \n\nONE DAY LAST SPRING, I walked into the Hyde Park apartment the Obamas bought when they married, hoping to find clues to their old lives.\n\nTheir unit, part of a complex of redbrick houses turned condominiums, had a few appealing touches  a green-tiled fireplace, a dining room with elaborate woodwork and a small porch in the back (where Michelle let her husband smoke, a friend said). But the apartment was narrow and worn, with fixtures that must have been aging even several years ago.\n\nThe Hole  as Michelle called her husbands tiny, dark office  lived up to its name. The cramped master bedroom had a closet barely big enough for one wardrobe. Where did Michelle keep her clothes? The apartment was neat, friends said, but bursting with childrens gear and toys. The dining table tilted so much that food sometimes skidded south, eliciting an embarrassed look from Barack.\n\nHe would eventually learn to make his way in the State Senate, but his initial reports home were dismayed: Republicans held control, legislation he drafted was not even heard and even some Democrats teased him about his name. He would call me and say: This person is an idiot. They get an F,  Harwell says.\n\nHe went to Springfield without fully appreciating all of the consequences, said Judson Miner, Baracks boss at the civil rights law firm where hed been working for several years. Shortly after arriving, Barack called Miner to tell him that he was scaling back his legal work: he could not stay on top of it from downstate. Barack took on a heavier teaching load to compensate for the lost income. Michelle, who had given up corporate law, now earned less than $50,000 a year at her nonprofit job training young leaders, a former colleague estimates.\n\nFor Baracks swearings-in, Michelle would travel to Springfield. Harwell remembers Barack calling up with a report from downstate:  Michelle just couldnt believe it, she had to come down to see this mess for herself. \n\nAs she heard Baracks tales from Springfield, Michelle learned how good legislation vanished overnight for political reasons, Valerie Jarrett, one of the Obamas closest friends, told me recently in her White House office, where she is senior adviser to the president. This, Jarrett said, left Michelle even more frustrated than her husband. Hes more of a pragmatist, Jarrett says. Michelle takes a very principled position, and she thinks everyone should do the right thing.\n\nIf Baracks career was not going quite as he had hoped, Michelle did not seem settled on what she wanted to do professionally. She had taken a new position organizing student volunteers at the University of Chicago. After she became a mother in 1998, she was tempted to stay home, but like many political spouses, she felt financial pressure to work.\n\nMichelle would say, Well, youre gone all the time and were broke?  the president recalled when I spoke to the two of them.  How is that a good deal? \n\nYou do the math, Michelle told her friend Sandra Matthews, one day as the two sat on a playground bench. The time is coming pretty soon when Im going to have to decide. Im torn.\n\nWhen she interviewed for a job at the University of Chicago Medical Center, her baby sitter canceled at the last moment, and so Michelle strapped a newborn Sasha into a stroller, and the two rolled off together to meet the hospital president. She was in a lot of ways a single mom, and that was not her plan, recalls Susan Sher, who became her boss at the hospital and is now her chief of staff.\n\nIn addition to serving in Springfield and teaching law, Barack Obama was making his first bid for national office, challenging Bobby Rush, a popular South Side congressman. The race placed further strains on the Obamas. Unlike the wife who smiles tightly and insists everything is fine, Michelle sent a clear series of distress signals not only to her husband but to everyone around her. Barack and I, were doing a lot of talking, she would say when asked how she was holding up, according to the Rev. Alison Boden, a former colleague at the University of Chicago.\n\nBarack initially seems to have seen his absences as a manageable issue, something to be endured, just as he had as a child when living apart from his mother. Entering politics would be hard on a family, he knew, but he didnt quite understand until he lived it, Jarrett told me. Sher remembers Michelle talking to him, after the kids were born, about the importance of sheer physical presence, which wasnt something he was really used to. She talked about how important it was for them to at least talk every day.\n\nBarack helped as much as possible: on top of juggling jobs, he paid the household bills and did the grocery shopping, often wandering supermarket aisles late at night. When business in Springfield was done for the week, he always drove home that same night, sometimes arriving past midnight. As far as I was concerned, she had nothing to complain about, he wrote in his second book, The Audacity of Hope.\n\nOne afternoon in July, sitting in Jarretts airy West Wing office, I asked her how the young politician responded to his wifes assertions that he was leaving her to raise their children alone. Jarrett, whose own marriage ended in part because of career-related conflict, not only recalled Baracks replies but she also started reciting them.  Ill make it work,  said Jarrett, speaking in his voice.  We can make it work. Ill do more.  It sounded as if she could have been describing the Barack Obama of today, certain of his ability to juggle an intimidating number of priorities.\n\nTwo months later in the Oval Office, I asked the Obamas just how severe their strains had been. This was sort of the eye-opener to me, that marriage is hard, the first lady said with a little laugh. But going into it, no one ever tells you that. They just tell you, Do you love him? Whats the dress look like? \n\nI asked more directly about whether their union almost came to an end.\n\nThats overreading it, the president said. But I wouldnt gloss over the fact that that was a tough time for us.\n\nDid you ever seek counseling? I asked.\n\nThe first lady looked solemnly at the president. He said: You know, I mean, I think that it was important for us to work this through. . . . There was no point where I was fearful for our marriage. There were points in time where I was fearful that Michelle just really didnt  that she would be unhappy.\n\nSeveral years later, he devoted several pages of The Audacity of Hope to the conflict. (Judging from interviews, more than a few Chicagoans knew that Michelle once openly resented what her husbands political career had cost her, so he may have been wise to raise the issue before anyone else.) In the end, what seems more unusual than the Obamas who-does-what battles  most working parents have one version or another  is the way they turned them into a teachable moment, converting lived experience into both a political message and what sounds like the opposite of standard political shtick.\n\nIf my ups and downs, our ups and downs in our marriage can help young couples sort of realize that good marriages take work. . . . Michelle Obama said a few minutes later in the interview. The image of a flawless relationship is the last thing that we want to project, she said. Its unfair to the institution of marriage, and its unfair for young people who are trying to build something, to project this perfection that doesnt exist.\n\nIN THE HISTORY of Barack Obama, his landslide loss against Rush is now regarded as a constructive political failure, the point at which he shed some early dreaminess and hubris and became a cannier competitor. For the Obamas, this period was also one of constructive personal failure, forcing them to reckon with their longstanding differences.\n\nMichelle Obama accepted that she was not going to have a conventional marriage, that her husband would be away much of the time. That was me, wanting a certain type of model, and our lives didnt fit that model, she told me in an Iowa lunchroom in the summer of 2007. I just needed the support. It didnt have to be Barack. Craig Robinson later told me that he and his sister, Michelle, had another realization: if their father, a city water worker, had the kinds of opportunities their generation did, he probably would not have been home for dinner every night, either.\n\nMichelles mother, Marian Robinson, offered crucial help, often picking up Malia and Sasha after school. The Obamas closest friends  doctors, lawyers, M.B.A. types  also faced the strains of two-full-time-careers-plus-kids marriage. Now they banded into a kind of intergenerational urban kibbutz, a collective that shared meals and carpools and weekend activities.\n\nUnlike many political wives, Michelle was almost never alone. And she mostly skipped public events. When Barack spoke at the 2002 rally protesting the impending invasion of Iraq, now considered a pivotal moment of his career, his wife was not present. Ive had to come to the point of figuring out how to carve out what kind of life I want for myself beyond who Barack is and what he wants, she told The Chicago Tribune during his 2004 U.S. Senate campaign.\n\nDuring that race, Michelle was still a somewhat reluctant partner: at the outset, they made a deal that if he lost, he would get out entirely. It was a compromise, Marty Nesbitt, one of the presidents closest friends, told me. O.K. One. More. Try, he explained, banging out each word on a side table.\n\nWhen her husband was far outspent by a local millionaire in the primary, Michelle was almost like the mama cub coming to protect her young, says Kevin Thompson, a friend and former aide. By the time it became clear that Barack might be the third African-American senator since Reconstruction, she was headlining a few campaign events herself. It really clicked with her that this may be the destiny everyone was always talking about, Thompson said.\n\nMichelle, who was often wary of her husbands ambitions, may have also pushed him ahead with her high expectations of what he could achieve. Forward propulsion is the quality Maya Soetoro says her sister-in-law brought to Baracks career.\n\nTwo years after the Senate race, despite lingering reservations, she helped her husband define his reasons for running for president. On an autumn day in 2006, the Obamas sat in the Chicago office of the consultant David Axelrod, surrounded by advisers, weighing whether Barack should move forward.\n\nWhat do you think you could accomplish that other candidates couldnt? Michelle asked, according to Axelrod. The question hung in the air. Clearly, an Obama agenda would not look very different from that of Hillary Clinton or John Edwards.\n\nWhen I take that oath of office, there will be kids all over this country who dont really think that all paths are open to them, who will believe they can be anything they want to be, Barack replied. And I think the world will look at America a little differently.\n\nA FEW DAYS before the Indiana and North Carolina primaries, Anita Dunn, a political consultant who joined the Obama campaign, was reading the newspaper when a voters quote, expressing surprise that Barack Obama was a good family man, leapt out at her.\n\nEver since Obama made his debut on the national stage, hed been a solo act, telling the story of his singular, even lonely-sounding journey. In Pennsylvania, where Obama lost, the visuals of so many of our rallies was him alone, Dunn told me, which did nothing to allay voters concerns that the candidate was too distant  too foreign, professorial or precocious. Now Michelle and sometimes the girls were appearing more frequently onstage with Barack. Dunn shared the quote about Barack being a good family man with advisers, reinforcing their growing view that he was a more appealing candidate when surrounded by his family. The candidate beat expectations in both Indiana and North Carolina, all but locking up the nomination.\n\nThe Obamas began the presidential campaign, it seems, still thinking of politics as Baracks pursuit, not Michelles. She would need to participate heavily only at the beginning and end, and not much in the middle, Michelle told Sher. Despite her outward confidence, there were clues she was not entirely comfortable in her new role: staff members recall that of the 26 primary debates, forums in which he struggled, she attended only two or three. At the first, in Orangeburg, S.C., she sat frozen in the audience, so anxious she was unable to speak. It was like sitting next to a pillar of salt, says Melissa Winter, now her deputy chief of staff. She refused to even watch the remaining debates, avoiding television screens lest she catch a clip.\n\nShe also struggled to figure out where she fit in her husbands organization. Political operatives have a habitual disdain toward candidates spouses, one adviser told me, which Michelle, who had trouble obtaining even routine information like talking points, initially could not overcome. She had only two staff members and no speechwriter, and when she raised issues like the need to reach out more to women voters, she wasnt sure she had any influence on her husbands advisers.\n\nBecause the couple rarely campaigned together, interactions between them swelled with intermediaries. Winter would get a nightly phone call from Barack, then pad down a hotel hallway and tap on her bosss door. For Michelles 44th birthday, Barack deputized Winter to prepare his gift, a silver pendant necklace. He wanted to be sure I had it wrapped appropriately, that it had a ribbon on it, she told me. There was a lot of back and forth.\n\nWhen Jarrett officially joined the campaign at the behest of both Obamas, in addition to a long list of duties, she served as Michelles representative, as well as a kind of marital guardian and glue. Michelle took her concerns about Barack  for instance, her worry that his schedule allowed him no time to think  to Jarrett, who passed them on to aides. Barack worried, Jarrett said, that his wife had taken on too much. Was that O.K. with her? Jarrett says he wanted to know.\n\nFrom the beginning, Michelle turned Baracks courtship all those summers ago into a parable of political conversion, casting herself as a stand-in for the skeptical voter. When she first heard of him, his name and background seemed weird, she told voters who probably felt the same way. The first time Barack asked her out, she refused. He was a newcomer, her mentee, so it would be strange for him to become her boyfriend (or the president). But slowly he worked on her. One day she heard him give a speech and found herself captivated by the possibilities of what might be.\n\nWhen you listen to her tell that story, Robert Gibbs, the campaign spokesman and now the White House press secretary, told me, voters thought, Its O.K., yeah, this could work.\n\nShe also played a vital role in heading off the most promising female candidate in United States history. It was essential for the Obama campaign to present some sort of accomplished female counterweight to Hillary Clinton, to convince Democratic women that they could vote for Barack Obama and a powerful female figure besides. Consciously or not, Michelle made herself into an appealing contrast to the front-runner. She was candid; Hillary was often guarded. Michelle represented the idea that a little black girl from the South Side of Chicago could grow up to be first lady of the United States; Hillary stood for the hold of the already-powerful on the political system. And Michelle seemed to have the kind of marriage many people might aspire to; Hillary did not.\n\nAs the campaign accelerated after the first voting contests, Michelle Obama went from headlining intimate campaign events to enormous ones. Television cameras appeared, and some of her more forceful comments were endlessly replayed. When cable shows, bloggers and opponents fixated on her  on her supposed lack of patriotism, her supposedly angry streak  Barack was irate. As unflattering reports played on television, he would tell aides stories about her parents, about her as a mother, according to Gibbs, as if defending his wife in private could somehow help. Barack even met with the Fox executives Rupert Murdoch and Roger Ailes in part to insist that they treat her more respectfully.\n\nMichelle was annoyed that advisers  who had noticed for months that she could grow a bit too vehement in speeches  had never informed her of the developing problems, according to aides. Fearful of hurting her husbands chances, she even raised the prospect of ceasing to campaign, said one adviser who requested anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter. Jarrett recalls that she felt she had not gotten support. According to Sher, She was hurt at the idea that it was possible she wouldnt be an asset. It was almost as if she was reverting to an old pattern in her marriage: let Barack be a politician, and she would stay out of it.\n\nBut unlike other times, Michelle did not withdraw. In fact, the woman who had once resisted campaigning now told friends she enjoyed the crowds, the laughs and the votes she was earning. Her husband promised that the staff could fix whatever problems she faced. And he clearly needed her help. After years of leaving his family behind, he now turned to his wife to help carry him to the presidency.\n\nIve never done this before, she said to her husbands team, according to two aides. I just need you to tell me what to do.\n\nCampaigns often prove toxic to participants personal lives, but Jarrett says the Obamas relationship improved in the crucible of the race. They both rallied to each others defense and support, she says. By having to work hard at it, it strengthened their marriage.\n\nON A HUMID September day, Mayor Richard M. Daley of Chicago stood on a platform on the South Lawn of the White House hawking his citys Olympic bid. The Obamas flanked him, consciously or unconsciously assuming a series of identical positions as he spoke. When Michelle Obama clasped her hands in a downward triangle, the president did, too. When he folded his arms across his chest, so did she. During their own short speeches they gave outsize laughs at each others mild jokes and even mimed what the other was saying. As the president noted that the White House was just a tad larger than their home in Chicago, the first lady pinched her fingers to demonstrate. Milling around afterward, watching judo and fencing demonstrations, the couple leaned into each other, talking and nodding.\n\nFriends who visit the White House describe occasionally turning corners to find the first couple mid-embrace. They also seem unusually willing, for a presidential couple, to kiss, touch and flirt in public. It may be that they are broadcasting their affection to the rest of us, an advertisement of their closeness. Or they may simply be holding tightly to each other as they navigate new and uncertain terrain. Part of what they provide each other with is emotional safety, Jarrett explained.\n\nIn many ways, the Obamas have made the White House into a cocoon of sorts, with weekends full of movie-watching (Where the Wild Things Are), Scrabble games and childrens talent shows. They have surrounded themselves with those who have known them longest and best: Marian Robinson, the first ladys mother, has settled in (unaccustomed to being waited on, she wont let the staff do the laundry). Marty Nesbitt and his wife, Dr. Anita Blanchard, left Chicago to rent a house nearby for the summer, while Maya Soetoro, the presidents half-sister, and her husband, Konrad Ng, just moved here temporarily from Hawaii.\n\nThough the president reads aloud with his children in the evenings  he and Sasha are finishing Life of Pi  parenting in the White House is more complicated. Because the first couple cannot move freely about, their relatives take Malia and Sasha to the bookstore, on a walk through Chinatown, to the multiplex to see Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs. Last spring, according to Sher, well-meaning White House residence staff members tried to give the girls cellphones, so their parents could always reach them; the first lady stepped in to refuse.\n\nEven the Obamas jokes seem like coping mechanisms for the epic changes in their lives. They are still in their 40s, and they appear to deal with the grandeur and ritual of their new home with a kind of satirical distance that is hard to imagine coming from first couples of a pre-Jon Stewart generation. The president playfully addresses his wife using her official acronym, Flotus (first lady of the United States). She keeps up a running commentary on her husband as he navigates his new home, according to friends and relatives. Seeing him in the Oval Office cracks Michelle Obama up, she told me. Its like, what are you doing there? she said, gesturing to the presidents desk. Get up from there! In September, as they waited to greet a long, slow procession of foreign dignitaries and their spouses at the Group of 20 Summit in Pittsburgh, the first lady whispered in her husbands ear about things that I probably shouldnt repeat, he said.\n\nShe can puncture the balloon of this, he added, making him feel like the same person he was 5 or 10 years ago.\n\nCLEARLY, THE OBAMAS prefer to think of themselves as largely unaltered. The strengths and challenges of our marriage dont change because we move to a different address, the first lady said, the president studying the carpet as she answered. But even as they serve as sources of continuity for each other, their own partnership is undergoing significant change, not just in outward circumstance  the city, the exposure, the security, the staff, the house and so on  but far more fundamentally. Michelle Obama has gone from political skeptic to political partner to a woman with a White House agenda of her own, and an approval rating higher than the presidents.\n\nInitially, her office was seen as so peripheral by some in the West Wing that one aide referred to it as Guam: pleasant but powerless. Now Michelle Obama is towing the island closer to the mainland. In June, she appointed Sher  a lawyer, health care expert and member of the tight knot of hometown friends  her chief of staff. The first lady wants her office to be fully integrated into the presidents agenda, Sher says. Early this summer, for example, the first lady directed her staff to plan events that could help support health care reform and then volunteered to speak publicly on the topic. The president and first lady share a speechwriting staff, the East Wings press and communications team attends their West Wing counterparts meetings and every week, Dunn, Sher and Jarrett meet to discuss the integration of the presidents and first ladys business.\n\nWhen asked about how her insights affected the presidents thinking, the first lady seemed to bristle at the question. I am so not interested in a lot of the hard decisions that hes making, she said, drawing out the so. Why would I want to be in politics? I have never in my life ever wanted to sit on the policy side of this thing. Earlier in my conversation with them, the president faced forward, even leaning a bit away from his wife, but now he uncrossed his legs, swiveled and studied her, looking amused.\n\nDid she say shes not interested in policy? Sher, who also attended the Oval Office interview, tried to recall the next day, shaking her head and smiling. She always says that. (The first lady may have learned from Hillary Clintons example the perils of appearing too involved with policy.) While her boss has a limited appetite for policy details on many subjects, Sher explains, she regularly reads briefing papers from her staff on social issues. Early next year, aides say, the first lady will become the administrations point person on childhood obesity, working with her husbands policy advisers as well as her own on a problem that has stymied public-health experts for years. While the overall success of the administration is Barack Obamas test, Michelle Obama is beginning to gauge her ability to affect public opinion and behavior as well  which means risking criticism and failure.\n\nThe first lady also speaks to her husband about White House management and personnel decisions. She is not shy about expressing her views at all, Sher told me, recalling a conversation last spring between Barack and Michelle about a personnel problem. She was like, you should do this, dah dah dah dah and dah dah dah, Sher said, smacking the table. The first lady was so forceful, Sher said, that the president just grinned back until they both started to laugh. Its probably great that she does get worked up about injustices, Sher went on to say. It clearly seems to have an impact on him.\n\nMichelle Obama is also one of her husbands chief interpreters of public sentiment. On almost every domestic issue thats come up  up and through health care, the president told me, the first lady has offered very helpful insights on how something is going to play or whats important to people.\n\nShes like a one-person poll, he explained. Everyman! the first lady called out.\n\nWell sit at the dinner table, the president said. If our arguments are not as crisp or were not addressing a particular criticism coming from the other side, Michelle will be quick to say, I just think the way this thing is getting filtered right now is putting you on the defensive in this way or that way. (Sometimes, Sher says, when the president is describing some complicated issue, his wife interjects: You know what? People dont care about that.)\n\nDuring the campaign, Michelle Obama made much of her regular-person credentials, but they may now be expiring. She has not only a personal trainer and a stylist but also a staff of chefs and gardeners. Her world is somewhat less rarefied than that of her husband: she can steal away with less fuss, and her events bring her into more contact with ordinary citizens than his constant march of briefings. But her celebrity is nearly as great as her husbands, her world nearly as artificial. (By the time of the Democratic National Convention, Michelle told friends, she stopped knowing what the weather was each day: she lived in the permanently controlled climate zone of airplanes, cars and hotels.) A year or two ago, when Barack Obama talked about staying grounded, he mentioned his wife; now he tends to talk about his children or his dog instead. All presidential couples experience this sort of isolation, which is part of why they tend to come to resemble each other more than they do the rest of us.\n\nAs the great experiment of the presidency rolls on, the Obamas may finally learn definitive answers to the issues they have been debating over the course of their partnership. The questions they have long asked each other in private will likely be answered on the largest possible stage. They will discern whether politics can bring about the kind of change they have longed for and promised to others, or whether the compromises and defeats are too great. They will learn whether they were too ambitious or not ambitious enough. And even if they share the answer with no one else, the two will know better if everything does in fact become political  if their marriage can both embrace politics and also at some level stay free of it.\n\nThen, in three or seven years, the presidents political career will end. There will be no more offices to win or hold, and the Obamas will most likely renegotiate their compact once more  this time, perhaps more on Michelle Obamas terms.\n\nThe equality of any partnership is measured over the scope of the marriage. Its not just four years or eight years or two, the first lady said. Were going to be married for a very long time.','2017-03-25 03:51:12'),(158,21,'1a0f1694cb65044a84a6219fbaf4dd39f0f48da0087a02ccce65cba993222d4b','efde0450c4e84083815cf84ee055c6ba','','','One of Americas favorite couples is still very much in love.

Atkinson first came to prominence in the BBC\'s sketch comedy show Not the Nine O\'Clock News (197982), receiving the 1981 BAFTA for Best Entertainment Performance, and via his participation in The Secret Policeman\'s Ball from 1979. His other work includes the 1983 James Bond film Never Say Never Again, playing a bumbling vicar in Four Weddings and a Funeral (1994), voicing the red-billed hornbill Zazu in The Lion King (1994), and featuring in the BBC sitcom The Thin Blue Line (19951996). His work in theatre includes the 2009 West End revival of the musical Oliver!.\n\nAtkinson was listed in The Observer as one of the 50 funniest actors in British comedy,[2] and amongst the top 50 comedians ever, in a 2005 poll of fellow comedians.[3] In addition to his 1981 BAFTA, he received an Olivier Award for his 1981 West End theatre performance in Rowan Atkinson in Revue. He has also had cinematic success with his performances in the Mr. Bean movie adaptations Bean and Mr. Bean\'s Holiday, and also in Johnny English (2003) and its sequel Johnny English Reborn (2011).\n\nAtkinson, the youngest of four brothers, was born in Consett, County Durham, England, on 6 January 1955.[4][5][6][7]\n\nHis parents were Eric Atkinson, a farmer and company director, and Ella May (ne Bainbridge), who married on 29 June 1945.[7] His three older brothers are Paul, who died as an infant; Rodney, a Eurosceptic economist who narrowly lost the United Kingdom Independence Party leadership election in 2000; and Rupert.[8][9]\n\nAtkinson was brought up Anglican,[10] and was educated at Durham Choristers School a preparatory school, St. Bees School, and Newcastle University, where he received a degree in Electrical Engineering.[11] In 1975, he continued for the degree of MSc in Electrical Engineering at The Queen\'s College, Oxford, the same college where his father matriculated in 1935,[12] and which made Atkinson an Honorary Fellow in 2006.[13]\n\nFirst winning national attention in the Oxford Revue at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in August 1976,[11] he had already written and performed early sketches for shows in Oxford by the Etceteras  the revue group of the Experimental Theatre Club (ETC), and for the Oxford University Dramatic Society (OUDS), meeting writer Richard Curtis,[11] and composer Howard Goodall, with whom he would continue to collaborate during his career.\n\nAtkinson starred in a series of comedy shows for BBC Radio 3 in 1978 called The Atkinson People. It consisted of a series of satirical interviews with fictional great men, who were played by Atkinson himself. The series was written by Atkinson and Richard Curtis, and produced by Griff Rhys Jones.[14]\n\nAfter university, Atkinson toured with Angus Deayton as his straight man in an act that was eventually filmed for a television show. After the success of the show, he did a one-off pilot for London Weekend Television in 1979 called Canned Laughter. Atkinson then went on to do Not the Nine O\'Clock News for the BBC, produced by his friend John Lloyd. He featured in the show with Pamela Stephenson, Griff Rhys Jones and Mel Smith, and was one of the main sketch writers.\n\nThe success of Not the Nine O\'Clock News led to him taking the lead role in the medieval sitcom The Black Adder (1983), which he also co-wrote with Richard Curtis. After a three-year gap, in part due to budgetary concerns, a second series was broadcast, this time written by Curtis and Ben Elton. Blackadder II (1986) followed the fortunes of one of the descendants of Atkinson\'s original character, this time in the Elizabethan era. The same pattern was repeated in the two more sequels Blackadder the Third (1987) (set in the Regency era), and Blackadder Goes Forth (1989) (set in World War I). The Blackadder series became one of the most successful of all BBC situation comedies, spawning television specials including Blackadder\'s Christmas Carol (1988), Blackadder: The Cavalier Years (1988), and later Blackadder: Back & Forth (1999), which was set at the turn of the Millennium. The final scene of \"Blackadder Goes Forth\" (when Blackadder and his men go \"over the top\" and charge into No-Man\'s-Land) has been described as \"bold and highly poignant\".[15] During the 2014 centennial of the start of World War I, Michael Gove and war historian Max Hastings complained about the so-called \"Blackadder version of history\".[16][17][18]\n\nAtkinson\'s other creation, the hapless Mr. Bean, first appeared on New Year\'s Day in 1990 in a half-hour special for Thames Television. The character of Mr. Bean has been likened to a modern-day Buster Keaton,[20] but Atkinson himself has stated that Jacques Tati\'s character Monsieur Hulot was the main inspiration.[21]\n\nSeveral sequels to Mr. Bean appeared on television until 1995, and the character later appeared in a feature film. Bean (1997) was directed by Mel Smith, Atkinson\'s colleague in Not the Nine O\'Clock News. A second film, Mr. Bean\'s Holiday, was released in 2007. In 1995 and 1996, Atkinson portrayed Inspector Raymond Fowler in The Thin Blue Line television sitcom written by Ben Elton, which takes place in a police station located in fictitious Gasforth.\n\nAtkinson has fronted campaigns for Kronenbourg,[22] Fujifilm, and Give Blood. Atkinson appeared as a hapless and error-prone espionage agent named Richard Lathum in a long-running series of adverts for Barclaycard, on which character his title role in Johnny English and Johnny English Reborn was based. In 1999, he played the Doctor in The Curse of Fatal Death, a special Doctor Who serial produced for Comic Relief. Atkinson appeared as the Star in a Reasonably Priced Car on Top Gear in July 2011, driving the Kia Cee\'d around the track in 1:42.2, placing him at the top of the leaderboard until Matt LeBlanc later recorded a 1:42.1 lap time.\n\nAtkinson appeared at the 2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremony in London as Mr. Bean in a comedy sketch during a performance of \"Chariots of Fire\", playing a repeated single note on synthesizer.[23] He then lapsed into a dream sequence in which he joined the runners from the film of the same name (about the 1924 Summer Olympics), beating them in their iconic run along West Sands at St. Andrews, by riding in a minicab and tripping the front runner.[24] Atkinson starred as Jules Maigret in Maigret, a series of TV films from ITV.[25]\n\nIn November 2012, it emerged that Rowan Atkinson intended to retire Mr. Bean. \"The stuff that has been most commercially successful for me  basically quite physical, quite childish  I increasingly feel I\'m going to do a lot less of,\" Atkinson told the Daily Telegraph\'s Review. \"Apart from the fact that your physical ability starts to decline, I also think someone in their 50s being childlike becomes a little sad. You\'ve got to be careful.\"[26] He has also said that the role typecast him to a degree.[27]\n\nIn January 2014, however, ITV announced a new animated series featuring Mr. Bean with Rowan Atkinson returning to the role. It was expected to be released online as a web-series later in 2014, as a television broadcast followed shortly after.[28] In October 2014, Atkinson also appeared as Mr. Bean in a TV advert for Snickers. In 2015, he starred alongside Ben Miller and Rebecca Front in a sketch for BBC Red Nose Day in which Mr. Bean attends a funeral.\n\nAtkinson\'s film career began with a supporting part in the \'unofficial\' James Bond movie Never Say Never Again (1983) and a leading role in Dead on Time (also 1983) with Nigel Hawthorne. He was in the 1988 Oscar-winning short film The Appointments of Dennis Jennings. He appeared in Mel Smith\'s directorial debut The Tall Guy (1989) and appeared alongside Anjelica Huston and Mai Zetterling in Roald Dahl\'s The Witches (1990). He played the part of Dexter Hayman in Hot Shots! Part Deux (1993), a parody of Rambo III, starring Charlie Sheen.\n\nAtkinson gained further recognition with his turn as a verbally bumbling vicar in Four Weddings and a Funeral (1994) and featured in Disney\'s The Lion King (also 1994) as the voice of Zazu the red-billed hornbill. He also sang the song I Just Can\'t Wait To Be King in The Lion King. Atkinson continued to appear in supporting roles in comedies, including Rat Race (2001), Scooby-Doo (2002), Love Actually (2003) and the crime comedy Keeping Mum (2005), which also starred Kristin Scott Thomas, Maggie Smith and Patrick Swayze.\n\nIn addition to his supporting roles, Atkinson has also had success as a leading man. His television character Mr. Bean debuted on the big screen with Bean (1997) to international success. A sequel, Mr. Bean\'s Holiday (2007), also became an international success. He has also starred in the James Bond parody Johnny English (2003) and its sequel, Johnny English Reborn (2011).\n\nRowan Atkinson performed live on-stage skits  also appearing with members of Monty Python  in The Secret Policeman\'s Ball (1979) in London for Amnesty International.[29] Atkinson undertook a four-month tour of the UK in 1980. A recording of the stage performance was subsequently released as Live in Belfast.\n\nIn 1984, Atkinson appeared in a West End version of the comedy play The Nerd alongside a 10-year-old Christian Bale.[30] The Sneeze and Other Stories, seven short Anton Chekhov plays, translated and adapted by Michael Frayn, were performed by Rowan Atkinson, Timothy West and Cheryl Campbell at the Aldwych Theatre, London in 1988 and early 1989.[31]\n\nIn 2009, during the West End revival of the musical Oliver! based on Charles Dickens\' novel Oliver Twist, Atkinson played the role of Fagin.[32] His portrayal and singing of Fagin at the Theatre Royal Drury Lane in London garnered favourable reviews and he was nominated for an Olivier Award for best actor in a musical or entertainment.[33]\n\nOn 28 November 2012, Rowan Atkinson reprised the role of Blackadder at the \"We are Most Amused\" comedy gala for the Prince\'s Trust at the Royal Albert Hall in London. He was joined by Tony Robinson as Baldrick. The sketch involved the first new Blackadder material for 10 years, with Blackadder as CEO of Melchett, Melchett and Darling bank facing an enquiry over the banking crisis.[34]\n\nIn February 2013, Atkinson took on the titular role in a 12-week production (directed by Richard Eyre) of the Simon Gray play Quartermaine\'s Terms at Wyndham\'s Theatre in London with costars Conleth Hill (Game of Thrones) and Felicity Montagu (I\'m Alan Partridge).[35] In December 2013, he revived his schoolmaster sketch for Royal Free Hospital\'s Rocks with Laughter at the Adelphi Theatre.[36] A few days prior, he performed a selection of sketches in a small coffee venue in front of only 30 people.[37]\n\nBest known for his use of physical comedy in his Mr. Bean persona, Atkinson\'s other characters rely more heavily on language. Atkinson often plays authority figures (especially priests or vicars) speaking absurd lines with a completely deadpan delivery.\n\nOne of his better-known comic devices is over-articulation of the \"B\" sound, such as his pronunciation of \"Bob\" in the Blackadder II episode \"Bells\". Atkinson suffers from a stammer,[38] and the over-articulation is a technique to overcome problematic consonants.\n\nAtkinson\'s often visually based style, which has been compared to that of Buster Keaton,[20] sets him apart from most modern television and film comics, who rely heavily on dialogue, as well as stand-up comedy which is mostly based on monologues. This talent for visual comedy has led to Atkinson being called \"the man with the rubber face\": comedic reference was made to this in an episode of Blackadder the Third (\"Sense and Senility\"), in which Baldrick (Tony Robinson) refers to his master, Mr. E. Blackadder, as a \"lazy, big-nosed, rubber-faced bastard\".\n\nIn March 2001, while Atkinson was on a holiday trip to Kenya, the pilot of his private plane fainted. Atkinson managed to maintain the plane in the air until the pilot recovered, and was able to land the plane at Nairobi\'s Wilson Airport.[39]\n\nRowan Atkinson married Sunetra Sastry in February 1990. They have two children, Ben and Lily.[40] The couple first met in the late 1980s, when she was working as a makeup artist with the BBC.[41] They split in 2014 and were divorced on 10 November 2015.[42] Atkinson has been in a relationship with Louise Ford since 2014.[citation needed]\n\nIn June 2005, Atkinson led a coalition of the United Kingdom\'s most prominent actors and writers, including Nicholas Hytner, Stephen Fry, and Ian McEwan, to the British Parliament in an attempt to force a review of the controversial Racial and Religious Hatred Bill, which they felt would give overwhelming power to religious groups to impose censorship on the arts.[43] In 2009, he criticized homophobic speech legislation, saying that the House of Lords must vote against a government attempt to remove a free speech clause in an anti-gay hate law.[44]\n\nIn October 2012, he voiced his support for the Reform Section 5 campaign,[45] which aims to reform or repeal Section 5 of the Public Order Act 1986, particularly its statement that an insult can be grounds for arrest and punishment. It is a reaction to several recent high-profile arrests, which Atkinson sees as a restriction of freedom of expression.[46]\n\nAtkinson holds a category C+E (formerly \'Class 1\') lorry driving licence, gained in 1981, because lorries held a fascination for him, and to ensure employment as a young actor. He has also used this skill when filming comedy material. In 1991, he starred in the self-penned The Driven Man, a series of sketches featuring Atkinson driving around London trying to solve his obsession with cars, and discussing it with taxi drivers, policemen, used-car salesmen and psychotherapists.[47] A lover of and participant in car racing, he appeared as racing driver Henry Birkin in the television play Full Throttle in 1995.\n\nAtkinson has raced in other cars, including a Renault 5 GT Turbo for two seasons for its one make series. From 1997 to 2015, he owned a rare McLaren F1, which was involved in an accident in Cabus, near Garstang, Lancashire, with an Austin Metro in October 1999.[48] It was damaged again in a serious crash in August 2011 when it caught fire after Atkinson reportedly lost control and hit a tree.[49][50] That accident caused significant damage to the vehicle, taking over a year to be repaired and leading to the largest insurance payout in Britain, at 910,000.[51] He has previously owned a Honda NSX.[52] Other cars he owns include an Audi A8[53] a koda Superb, and a Honda Civic Hybrid.[54]\n\nIn July 2001, Atkinson crashed an Aston Martin V8 Zagato at an enthusiasts\' meeting, but walked away unhurt. This was whilst he was competing in the Aston Martin Owners Club event, at the Croft Racing Circuit, Darlington.[55]\n\nThe Conservative Party politician Alan Clark, himself a devotee of classic motor cars, recorded in his published Diaries a chance meeting with a man he later realized was Atkinson while driving through Oxfordshire in May 1984: \"Just after leaving the motorway at Thame I noticed a dark red DBS V8 Aston Martin on the slip road with the bonnet up, a man unhappily bending over it. I told Jane to pull in and walked back. A DV8 in trouble is always good for a gloat.\" Clark writes that he gave Atkinson a lift in his Rolls-Royce to the nearest telephone box, but was disappointed in his bland reaction to being recognised, noting that: \"he didn\'t sparkle, was rather disappointing and chtif.\"[56]\n\nOne car Atkinson has said he will not own is a Porsche: \"I have a problem with Porsches. They\'re wonderful cars, but I know I could never live with one. Somehow, the typical Porsche people  and I wish them no ill  are not, I feel, my kind of people. I don\'t go around saying that Porsches are a pile of dung, but I do know that psychologically I couldn\'t handle owning one.\"[54][57]\n\nIn July 2011, Atkinson appeared as the \"Star in a Reasonably Priced Car\" on Top Gear, driving the Kia Cee\'d around the track in 1:42.2, granting him first place on the leaderboard.[52]\n\nAtkinson was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the 2013 Birthday Honours for services to drama and charity.[58][59]\n\nAtkinson is known for criticising religious views and opposing the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005 law.[60][61]','2017-03-25 03:51:12'),(164,22,'1cccaab80b174d8fd6ad0558fd30067edbd664d37b5d451bb4f520bdc34888af','daec1d6809094836a448b4540481d62e','','','Rowan Atkinson is not dead, but anyone who was poking around on Facebook in the past few days may have been fooled into thinking that the Mr. Bean comedian had met his demise.\n\nA viral death hoax circulated on the social media site claiming that the actor had died, with a link appearing to point to the BBC sharing a story that he died of a suicide. The story prompted many people to share their shock an offer condolences to Atkinsons family. Others went online seeking clarification on the story.\n\nOne of those comes from the site Linkbeef, a site well known within the death hoax world for spewing out other fake stories of celebrities meeting their demise.\n\nThe site has a story claiming that Rowan Atkinson was found dead in an apparent suicide. Its difficult to imagine anyone would have been fooled by the story, which refers to the British comedian as US actor and comedian Rowan Atkinson and claimed that he was found dead in his home in California.\n\nThe Linkbeef report was actually a cut-and-paste copy of another story claiming that Adam Sandler was dead, one that went viral two separate times in the past year. The report also seemed to mix up details about the real-life death of comedian Robin Williams.\n\nHis publicist said he had been battling severe depression. In the past he had talked, and even joked, about his struggles with alcohol and drugs. Atkinson had recently returned to a rehabilitation center to fine-tune his sobriety, the Los Angeles Times reported in September. The local Sheriffs office said Atkinson was found unconscious and not breathing at his home near Tiburon, north of San Francisco At this time, the Sheriffs Office Coroner Division suspects the death to be a suicide due to asphyxia, but a comprehensive investigation must be completed before a final determination is made, police said in a statement.\n\nThe latest Rowan Atkinson death hoax didnt stand up much to scrutiny, either. As Snopes noted, the graphic that went viral claimed that the Mr. Bean actor was born in 1995, making him 21 years old. It separately referred to him as a 58-year-old, though Atkinson is actually 61.\n\nSome people caught on to the inconsistencies.\n\nThe Rowan Atkinson death hoax actually served a different function.

The message, which features a photograph ofRowan Atkinson and the caption R.I.P. 1995  2016 Will Miss You Mr Bean claims to be breaking news from the BBC. It also claims to be a FOX News update.\n\nThankfully, however, the claims in the message are untrue.Rowan Atkinson is alive and well. There are no credible reports that support the claim that Rowan Atkinson has died or attempted suicide. Despite its claims, the message hasno connection to either the BBC or Fox News. And, of course,Rowan Atkinson was not born in 1995 as claimed in the message. Nor is he 58 years old in 2016. In fact, he was born in 1955 and is currently 61 years old.\n\nIf you clickon the message, you will be taken to a clickbait website.

NYPD sources involved with the NBC forums security detail confirm Clinton was wearing an inductive earpiece, the same technology employed by almost all lead Broadway actors to receive forgotten lines and stealth off-stage cues from directors. The flesh-colored earbud is easily concealed. There are no wires running directly to the ear like you see with the units employed by Secret Service protection detail personnel.\n\nThe skin-tone piece Clinton was wearing, however, was somewhat different from the standard issued stealth earpiece and is much different in appearance from a hearing aid. This unit is considered a micro earbud which contains all the technology but is a fraction of the size with a very high price tag. In fact, most of the units this size, approximately 3mm or comparable to a small pearl stud earring, are normally issued to law enforcement or corporate security teams, sources said. At a size that small, the earbud is designed to sit inside the opening of the ear canal, almost invisible to anyone. However, the unit does move and shift along with its wearer and at times can slightly pop out of the canal and require a quick readjustment, experts said.\n\nIronically, the revelation that Clinton was wearing such a unit might have only been recognized because of astute NYPD officers attached to her security detail who are accustomed to seeing the stealth apparatus at stage shows, conventions and security personnel of VIPs and international dignitaries at the United nations and elsewhere in the five boroughs. Likewise, NYPD detectives employ a parallel technology to communicate during undercover Ops.\n\nBased on experts familiar with the technology, the stealth earpiece operates on a bandwidth from 300 Hz to 4KHz. Many such units are powered by SONY. The range of the unit can be unlimited depending on how the back end is set up. Technically, you could receive cues from 100 feet away or from someone sitting in Washington D.C. while you sat in New York City, experts said. The set up and range is flexible based on need and use. The unit does not require Bluetooth to operate via short distances but long range operations would require Bluetooth, which is easily configured.\n\nWikileaks may have unwittingly foreshadowed this Bombshell story years ago. Tucked away in its Clintons email archive is an otherwise obscure 2009 email from aide Huma Abedin asking Clinton if she remembered to her earpiece. This beckons the question: Did Hillary use her secret earpiece to be coached and guided through her testimony at Congressional hearings on Benghazi, her missing emails and beyond?

Many different companies market hearing aids that are meant to be concealed.\n\nThe second possibility, some say, is an inductive earpiece.\n\nStage actors often use these to help with cues and missed lines during performances. They are meant to be concealed, and with Bluetooth technology, those speaking to Clinton through it wouldnt even have to be in the same city.\n\nOn Sept. 25, the day before the big debate, the World Tribune noted that the FEC hasnt specifically ruled out the use of ear mics for presidential candidates, even though moderators cannot wear them.\n\nA Maryland voter reportedly wrote a Sept. 8 letter to FEC Commissioner Matthew Petersen requesting a clear response to the issue.\n\nI read reports that during the televised event questioning each of the candidates on their qualifications to serve as Commander in Chief, that Secretary Clinton had a microphone in her ear to receive prompting and guidance from advisers off stage, wrote Laurence B. of Columbia, Maryland, according to the World Tribune.\n\nSurely this is a more serious violation of competition than the doping which the Olympics have had to clean up.

But there are objections to this idea. The pack is a bit larger than usual, but this is not an impossible thing. Some microphones have large battery packs, the blog post said, The next concern is that a tube appears to run from the box up to the base of her neck. Why the tube and why the base of the neck? Arent microphone cables quite thin these days, if not entirely wireless? Or are we merely seeing a fold in the back of her coat?\n\nIt continued, Finally, the microphone appears on her chest, not at her collar. Why run a wire over your shoulder? Something does not add up.\n\nAnd now, a picture has emerged that seems to show her wearing a nearly invisible earpiece. Is the earpiece real, or a trick of light? What is the earpiece for? Is it so a team can feed her answers? Is it an anti-seizure device? A hearing aid?\n\nClinton could be entirely innocent. But theres a bigger problem here, the fact that we are asking these questions at all. The fact theyre getting play in the press, it said. This speaks to Clintons integrity. After decades of public service, the one thing Americans have learned about Hillary Clinton is that she lacks integrity. She has been caught in lies, caught hiding the truth, and even caught lying under oath.\n\nIt would be good to know why such a device is visible on Clintons back and not Trump. What is the device? Is it a backup microphone? Then fine. Alls well that ends well.\n\nBut can we as a nation afford to elect a candidate whose honesty, ethics and integrity are in constant question? Far from being an asset to the country, such a leader would be a detriment, even if the perception were false. And if the perception is accurate, she would be doubly dangerous.\n\nHillary for prosecution, not president!

Shes the kind of sociopath who will lie even if the truth were more beneficial, added Woods, linking to an article by TruePundit which reported that Hillary was wearing an earpiece to receive stealth coaching during the NBC live town hall event.\n\nNYPD sources involved with the NBC forums security detail confirm Clinton was wearing an inductive earpiece, the same technology employed by almost all lead Broadway actors to receive forgotten lines and stealth off-stage cues from directors. The flesh-colored earbud is easily concealed. There are no wires running directly to the ear like you see with the units employed by Secret Service protection detail personnel, claimed the article.\n\nThe report goes on to provide technical details about the earpiece, asserting that it is almost invisible to anyone and is normally issued to law enforcement or corporate security teams.\n\nThe story also drew almost a thousand comments over on The Donald subreddit, with one user commenting, Either she admits a health issue and says shes deaf or she admits to cheating.\n\nI commented earlier during the Town Hall saying her responses seemed a little slower than normal.

Heres one of them: Was Clinton wearing an earpiece?\n\n\"Has Hillary Been Caught Cheating (Again)?\" asked Charisma News, a Christian political website. \"Was Hillary Wired for Trump Debate?\" asked the conservative website World Net Daily. The U.K.-based Express website summarized, \"Did Hillary Clinton wear an earpiece to CHEAT the US debate? Conspiracy theory sweeps web.\"\n\nIts not the first time Clinton has faced such suggestions. As Snopes.com has noted, some questioned whether Clinton had been wearing one at NBCs commander-in-chief forum on Sept. 7. Snopes concluded that there was \"nothing unusual\" and what viewers were seeing \"most likely captured a light source temporarily reflecting on Clinton\'s ear.\"\n\nA reader suggested we check out what happened at the first debate -- an even higher-profile event with upwardof 80 million Americans watching. So we will. (Snopes gave a False rating to a related claim that Clinton had a bulge in the back of her jacket at the debate that could have been a \"coughing prevention machine.\")\n\nThe original post, at Charisma News, said the device \"was meant to match her skin tone almost perfectly.\" The article speculated that the device could be a hearing aid, an \"inductive earpiece\" used by actors to better hear cues, or an \"anti-seizure device.\"\n\n\"None of these paint a particularly good picture for the Democratic presidential nominee. Either she has an as-yet undisclosed health condition, ranging from mild to severe, or she\'s been cheating during the televised debates,\" the article says.\n\nFor the record, Clinton campaign spokesman Josh Schwerin told PolitiFact that Clinton \"was not wearing an earpiece.\" Asked whether she has a hearing aid, he said, \"No.\"\n\nSo, lets take a look at the original evidence offered -- a Reuters photo and an enlargement that some say show the suspicious, fleshy bulge in Clintons ear.\n\nTo be honest, we dont see any device in this image. (Whats more flesh-like than flesh itself?) But we decided to look at some other images in our wire service archive to see if anything else made her ear look unusual.\n\nWhen we reached out to Charisma News, an editor suggested that we contact the author of the article. We emailed him the images, but we did not hear back.\n\nIn these four close-ups, we see nothing that mirrors what the original Reuters image showed (which, again, didnt even look like a device to us). We just see a lot of ear flesh.\n\nWhen we ran these images by Richard Quindry, a Philadelphia-area photographic and Photoshop expert, he said that only image 2 could even potentially show anything -- the narrow white form inside the ear canal. But even saying that that shape is something other than skin would be speculative at best, he said.\n\nEach of the other images -- as well as the original Reuters image -- show \"nothing\" to support a claim that she used an earpiece, Quindry said.\n\nInternet claims suggested that a debate photograph of Clinton showed her wearing an earpiece.

Heres an image of a lavalier mic set, similar to the type worn by Clinton and Trump during the debate:\n\nClintons ears and neck were also clearly visible during the debate. While a secret wire could have been concealed in her dress, a wire connected to an earpiece mounted in or behind her ear would have been noticeable.\n\nMoreover, the questions asked of the candidates during the first debate posed no surprises  they were obvious queries that both sides should have anticipated and prepped for, and therefore neither should have needed offstage help with their responses.\n\nThis isnt the first time that a harmless microphone wire has been mistaken for something sinister.

One in particular caught Magary\'s eye.\n\nThis is Gawker Media, where occasionally honest-to-God reportering happens, and so we got to work. We dug. This is a bit of what we found.\n\nStevie Wonder, ne Stevland Hardaway Morris, was born on May 13, 1950 in Saginaw, Mich., and rendered blind shortly after his birth. Per Wikipedia:\n\nThe Takeaway: Stevie Wonder has allegedly basically always been blind. By the time he was, like, an actual person with memories and object permanence and whatnot, he couldn\'t see. By this logic, he shouldn\'t be able to remember what colors and things look like. This is important.\n\nThe story goes that Stevie Wonder was a vivacious boy, so much so that he would often prank adults. By himself. (This is courtesy Bomani Jones, about whom much more below.)\n\nThe Other Takeaway: Is it so hard to believe that this isn\'t the genesis of Stevie Wonder, Pretend-Blind Person?\n\nFrom some Stevie Wonder truther blog:\n\nI watched an interview with Boy George a few months back, and he reckons [Stevie Wonder]\'s not completly blind since Stevie Wonder once came over and playfully strangled him at a party once, and Boy George was like; \'how could he know where I was if he\'s completly blind?\' [The original source of this secondary account of secondary source evidence can be found here, anda we can assure you that we are reporters of the highest caliber, holding standards of source verification to be of utmost importance. Be assured of the accuracy of our three-times removed report as it tells exactly what Holla Back Boy claims to have seen Boy George tell an unknown interviewer about a drunken memory of his in which Wonder definitely was maybe able to use his eyes at that party they were at. The hoax is real.] It is important to acknowledge that this report not only suggests Wonder continued sightedness, but also his use of vision for violence and bigotry in strangulation of an openly, and some may say flamboyantly, homosexual man. The idea that Wonder is \"like not completly blind\" has been further corroborated by certified Yahoo! Answers reporter aflkdsj l.\n\nThe Takeaway: Stevie Wonder is homophobic, and targeted Boy George, with his eyes.\n\nThis is a cut from Stevie Wonder\'s \"Don\'t Drive Drunk\" song/PSA.\n\nThe Takeaway: OK, so he doesn\'t look that conspicuous here. But why is drunk driving his fight?\n\nIn 2010, Stevie Wonder and Paul McCartney performed in the White House East Room. Clumsily, McCartney knocked over a microphone. Watch what happens next:\n\nThe Takeaway: Stevie Wonder is not blind.\n\nOK, so apparently Oprah bought Stevie Wonder a car, or something, once? Hm. The money shot here is about 2:40 in, when Stevie Wonder turns to this guy full on before grabbing him in a loving, one-armed hug.\n\nThe Takeaway: He looked your boy dead in the face.\n\nBomani Jones is an ESPN personality and one of the brightest guys in sports media.

A lot. He also gets courtside seats all the time. He cheers and seems to follow the action.\n\nThe Takeaway: Stevie Wonder likes basketball, because basketball is a great sport to watch live and up close.\n\nTMZ is out here in these streets, and has been for a long time.

One of the most notorious examples was the claim that President Joko Jokowi Widodo had plans to bring 10 million Chinese workers into the country, placing Indonesian jobs at risk. This spurious information became so widespread that the president was eventually forced to issue a clarification, stating that the 10 million figure was derived from tourism targets.\n\nEarlier this week, an image of Jakarta Governor Basuki Tjahaja Purnama, or Ahok, being kissed on the cheeks by two women went viral on Facebook. The Facebook post described the two women as being from sleazy Jakarta nightclub Alexis, and was claimed to demonstrate why Ahok had failed to close the nightspot. The two women were, in fact, US celebrities Miley Cyrus and Megan Fox, and the picture was created by Indonesian Photoshop artist Agan Harahap, who is well known for his playful merging of Indonesian and celebrity images.\n\nWhile many examples of fake news might seem similarly ridiculous, hoaxes and fake news are causing serious damage to Indonesian democracy, like a cancer growing out of control.\n\nThe quality of democracy is largely determined by the extent of meaningful and autonomous public participation in the political process. When political engagement and collective action is based on lies or manipulated data, participation may end up harming, rather than strengthening, democracy.\n\nHoaxes  fake news designed to influence or provoke an audience into acting in accordance with the interests of the creator  are now a ubiquitous part of the public conversation online in Indonesia. Although some is produced with the specific intention of attracting clicks and advertising revenue, many of the hoaxes shared on social media are created by people with a specific political agenda. When the facts dont support this agenda, hoaxes emerge.\n\nAlthough fake news has been around for many years, it began to explode after the bitterly contested 2014 Presidential Election. Anyone who followed that election would recall the fake news spread by supporters of eventual winner Jokowi and his opponent, Prabowo Subianto. Both sides were guilty of spreading fake news and slander, but most attacks targeted Jokowi  and many were based on race and religion. For example, an obituary that circulated on social media gave the impression that Jokowi was Chinese, and claimed that the H in front of his name actually stood for Hubertus, rather than Haji, indicating that he had made the pilgrimage to Mecca.\n\nRather than being simple political attacks, these fake stories and hoaxes caused significant damage to the foundations of tolerance and multiculturalism in Indonesia, leading to divisions that persisted beyond the life of the election.\n\nThis plague of hoaxes and fake news doesnt only affect countries that are still consolidating their democracies like Indonesia. It is also a problem in some countries with a long tradition of liberal democracy, such as the United States.\n\nWhy, in an increasingly open and connected world, are the public apparently willing to accept insults as the basis for action, or hate as a legitimate political position? The answer is closely linked to the issue of social dislocation, resulting from social and economic crises that have been poorly anticipated or addressed by political elites.\n\nTake the Indonesian case. In its extensive 2015 report on inequality in Indonesia, the World Bank stated that the richest 1 per cent of Indonesians controlled almost 50 per cent of the economic resources in the country. Meanwhile, the top 10 per cent controlled as much as 77 per cent of the economic resources in Indonesia, leaving just 23 per cent for the remaining 90 per cent of the population.\n\nThis growing inequality and injustice has caused social distress and it is compounded by the perennial problem of the poor accountability of Indonesias elected leaders. Despite the advances of the democratic era, connections remain weak between the state and civil society, and lawmakers and their constituents.\n\nIn many countries, including in Indonesia, this situation has been exploited by figures who claim to speak on behalf of the majority, directing the anxieties and fear caused by social dislocation toward the threat of immigrants, domination of minority groups, or foreign intervention in politics. In this way, facts become secondary to the broader political goal.\n\nThis is particularly dangerous in Indonesia, where many citizens have yet to develop the habit of engaging critically with the media.\n\nHoaxes as political instruments are not a sign of a challenge from civil society to state power  despite what some Indonesians have claimed. Hoaxes are in fact part of political competition and are often used by elites who exploit and manipulate public fear. And even if political elites or powerful actors are not actively reproducing misleading or incorrect information, they have been happy to rely on the support it may bring them.\n\nFighting the disease of fake news is a struggle to reclaim logic and reasoning from their enemies.

In fact, many have credited his success in the 2014 presidential election to his ability to use multiple social media platforms to mobilize his supporters.\n\nBut the 2014 presidential election also taught Jokowi about the new menace to society, fake news. As voting day neared in early 2014, fake news began to circulate to hurt his credibility, including articles accusing him of having ties to the now-defunct Indonesian Communist Party (PKI) or another piece that alleged he was of Chinese descent.\n\nThings went downhill after the election, with the massive proliferation of fake news and hoaxes through many social media platforms and a number of messaging services such as WhatsApp.\n\nAfter huffing and puffing over the past few months, Jokowi finally declared war on fake news and hoaxes on Thursday.\n\nHe convened a Cabinet meeting with relevant ministers to discuss measures that could be taken to combat fake news and disinformation.\n\nCiting data that said there were 132 million internet users in the country, about 52 percent of the total population, Jokowi urged that people should be aware that information technology can also make negative impacts on society.\n\nJokowi said of the total number, 129 million were active social media users and each person spent threeand-a-half hours a day on the internet through their mobile phones, which helped the proliferation of fake news.\n\nThe President has repeatedly expressed in recent months his concerns over the growing intensity of disinformation on social media, including the latest fake news item on the influx of millions of Chinese workers into Indonesia.\n\nJokowi has ordered an investigation into the fake news and ordered the prosecution of individuals responsible for spreading the rumor, which he said was fanned to fuel anti-China sentiment.\n\nThe President has also expressed concern over the use of social media for people to exchanging memes or provocative remarks to mock and attack embattled Jakarta gubernatorial candidate Basuki Ahok Tjahaja Purnama, who stands accused of blasphemy.\n\nIn the Thursday meeting, Jokowi called for strict law enforcement and what he called an evaluation of online media outlets responsible for producing provocative fake news.\n\nJokowi has also ordered relevant government agencies to launch a massive campaign on social media and internet literacy, saying that it is essential to see netizens get involved in the campaign to bring about positive and productive communication on social media consistent with our cultural values.\n\nResponding to Jokowis order, Communications and Information Minister Rudiantara said he planned to launch what he called an anti-hoax society in January.\n\nThe Cabinet meeting also ordered government agencies such as the National Encryption Agency (Lemsaneg) and the State Intelligence Agency (BIN), as well as the Culture and Education Ministry to improve coordination in handling issues related to the internet and social media.\n\nRudiantara said better coordination and fast response from relevant ministries and institutions was crucial in dealing with fake news.\n\nHe also maintained that the government would continue to protect freedom of speech in the fight against fake news.','2017-03-25 03:51:12'),(197,26,'225a269ec42e269fdc93f58b8a33107413c14c2bd4e0f0e5b1cb5172ca1d5bfc','dbdb94cbcaae4df5b01e9beb100f396a','','','Amid the increased spread of fake news on the internet, President Joko Jokowi Widodo said on Sunday that social media has become a visible danger.\n\nDuring a commemoration of the birthday of the Prophet Muhammad in Pekalongan, Central Java, Jokowi said that the spread of fake news would lead to the disintegration of the country into its various tribes, races and religions.\n\nThe danger to the nations unity, he said, came from the cellular phones from which everyone can access information these days.\n\nThere is fake information and trusted information. There are slanders; there are truths. Some are instigators while others not. The Information Age is very open. We should filter the information or it will tear apart our unity, he said.\n\nIndonesia, with 129 million active social media users, has seen a growing intensity of disinformation on the internet in recent months, including the latest fake news item about an influx of millions of Chinese workers into Indonesia, which Jokowi said was meant to fan antiChina sentiments.\n\nJokowi declared war on fake news and hoaxes during a year-end Cabinet meeting, during which he ordered government agencies to improve coordination in handling issues related to the internet and social media.\n\nAfter blocking at least 11 websites containing fake news and hate speech, the government has moved to expedite the establishment of an integrated national agency to control the spread of disinformation in cyberspace, which is considered a serious threat to national security.\n\nThe agency is expected to commence operations this month. It would be tasked with monitoring national cyber activities, including expediting the process of sorting online information and identifying what is accurate and what is fake.\n\nThe tough competition in the Jakarta gubernatorial election was another trigger for the spreading of fake news.\n\nSectarian comments have been thrown at candidates on social media as they battle to win the February election.\n\nJokowi said every citizen should treasure diversity in the country as a source of strength.\n\nProphet Muhammad gave us examples in the art of politics. He made a political contract called the Madinah Charter in which all agreed for unity. Islam respects diversity of races and groups, he said in front of the thousands of people who attended the commemoration.\n\nIndonesia has more than 700 tribes with 1,100 local languages. It is Gods blessing. We have 34 provinces and 516 regencies and municipalities. Lets keep our unity, he added.\n\nThe President came with Indonesian Military (TNI) chief Gen. Gatot Nurmantyo, National Police chief Gen. Tito Karnavian, Armys chief of staff Gen.

Several Muslim clerics from other countries were also present.\n\nWe should uphold Indonesian Islam. We should show unity not only here, but also to the world, said Jokowi.\n\nMuhammad Luthfi reminded Muslims that the countrys strength is in its unity.\n\nHere the President, the TNI chief and the police chief, along with the clerics, cannot be separated. This is a symbol of unity that cannot be compromised, he said.\n\nGanjar said the public should not get caught on the information generated by the fake news.\n\nHoaxes are lies, slanders.

The image, which went viral, falsely portrayed the long-haired male journalist as Amalia Ayuningtyas  a female election volunteer for the governor of Jakarta. The photo, the text claimed, was of Amalia immodestly casting off her usual hijab. It asked: Wheres the Veil??\n\nJakarta\'s Christian and ethnically Chinese governor  Basuki Tjahaja Purnama, popularly known as Ahok  is a target for hard-line Muslims, who have successfully pressured the authorities to put him on trial for blasphemy . It is not surprising that memes are being produced that seek to depict the Muslim volunteers in his camp as irreligious and profane.\n\nWhen I first saw it, I was able to laugh, Ulin tells TIME about the photo collage. But later on, it became so troublesome because there were people who believed it  [The meme] was around for quite a while, and I became tired of explaining it.\n\nHoaxes like this, and fake news items in general, have become a massive problem in Indonesia in recent months, coinciding with the hotly contested Jakarta gubernatorial election campaign. To be sure, the sharing of fake news on social media has contributed to political tension in many countries  by one estimate, it generated more social-media engagement than real news during the U.S. presidential election in November  but in Indonesia, with its recent incidences of domestic terrorism, and its long and bloody history of anticommunist, anti-Christian and anti-Chinese pogroms, inflaming ethnic and political tensions is potentially deadly.\n\nPresident Joko Jokowi Widodo, seen as a Muslim moderate, has vowed to crack down, telling a Cabinet meeting that fake news was nothing short of an attempt to destabilize his government. Slander, hatred and rude words on social media are increasingly troubling people, Jokowi tweeted on Dec. 29. We need determined and tough law enforcement.\n\nThe problem first drew significant attention during Indonesia\'s 2014 presidential election, in which Jokowi  Ahok\'s predecessor as Jakarta\'s top official  was a candidate. During electioneering, Jokowi was the constant target of a smear campaign that falsely claimed he was, among other things, the child of Indonesian Communist Party members, of Chinese descent, and a Christian. (He was forced to make his marriage certificate public to quell the rumors.)\n\nNow, the creators of fake news are targeting Ahok, who was deputy governor of Indonesia\'s sprawling capital under Jokowi. Ahok succeeded his boss in the governorship and, backed by Jokowis party, is now seeking his own mandate in the gubernatorial election next year, competing with two other rivals, including former President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono\'s son. Ahok\'s candidacy is opposed by hard-liners who, insisting that Indonesia\'s top jobs be filled Muslims only, want to quash any chances Ahok may have of following Jokowi into the national arena.\n\nAn edited video and transcript of a campaign speech Ahok made in September, uploaded onto Facebook, went viral and led to ultra-conservative Muslims accusing him of denigrating the Quran. (Ahok suggested in the speech that hard-liners who cited a Quranic verse to support their position that non-Muslims shouldn\'t hold high office were misleading voters. His exact words were: Ladies and gentlemen, you dont have to vote for me  because youve been lied to by those using [the Qurans] Surah al-Maidah verse 51.)\n\nThree massive demonstrations resulted, bringing tens of thousands of people to the streets of Jakarta, demanding that Ahok be jailed. He was subsequently put in the dock .\n\nAhok\'s Chinese ethnicity is the target of much of Indonesia\'s false news  highly disturbing in a country where tens of thousands of Chinese have lost their lives in pogroms dating back to Dutch colonial rule. There are false rumors of 10 million mainland Chinese workers swamping Indonesia (which Jokowi has rebuffed, saying that 10 million is the number of Chinese tourists we hope will come). Others claim that the design of Indonesias new monetary notes resembles Chinese currency  or that Ahoks free HPV vaccine program could make girls infertile, and is, therefore, part of a Chinese conspiracy to diminish the Indonesian population. Hoaxers also claimed that the commander of the armed forces, General Gatot Nurmantyo, has warned that communist China has started to meddle in this country. Both the Indonesian military and the general have denied he ever made such a statement.\n\nAt the same time, Anti-Chinese sentiment isnt independent of its own. It is part of a larger network, says the social-media activist Ulin, who is a supporter of Ahok. He says that fake news is also whipping up anticommunist and anti-Shiite feelings. All of this is to heighten anti-Ahok sentiment while at the same time de-legitimizing Jokowi.\n\nHoax news has been a daily phenomenon in Indonesia, says Titi Anggraini, executive director of the Association for Elections and Democracy, a Jakarta-based elections watchdog that is also known as Perludem in Indonesian. But, the spread of hoax news intensified during the 2014 presidential election and is intensifying in [the run-up to] the 2017 Jakarta gubernatorial election.\n\nThe government, watchdog groups and even religious organizations have taken steps to stem its spread. The Communications Ministry on Wednesday blocked 11 websites, mostly for spreading hatred and misinformation, following a similar step in November. Fact-check sites, apps and Facebook pages, run by activists and volunteers, have sprung up to set the record straight. Nahdlatul Ulama, the biggest Islamic mass organization in Indonesia, has kicked off an anti-fake-news campaign called #TurnBackHoax, while Muhammadiyah, the second biggest Islamic organization, has declared that spreading hoax news is tantamount to a sin. The Press Council has also said it will be verifying trusted media outlets.\n\nSuch actions are important to make things right and to teach a lesson to offenders, Titi tells TIME. But, she adds, The legal process, especially criminal punishment, is really ultimum remidium [the last resort]  and calls for digital literacy education. She also wants guarantees that law enforcement will respect freedom of expression. But that is no easy balance to strike in Indonesia\'s tense political atmosphere.','2017-03-25 03:51:12'),(199,26,'225a269ec42e269fdc93f58b8a33107413c14c2bd4e0f0e5b1cb5172ca1d5bfc','df266c63c3d34c0aabf2d9fc527baf06','','','TEMPO.CO, Jakarta - Fake information and news are nothing new in Indonesia. Hoaxes are found in almost every era, from President Soekarno to President Jokowi. Fake news often duped both the people and government officials.\n\nA historian at the Indonesian Institute of Sciences (LIPI) Asvi Warman Adam said there are many motives behind fake news circulation, ranging from inciting outrage to personal gain.\n\nFake news stories also concerned President Joko Widodo. Meanwhile, the Indonesian Ulema Council (MUI) had planned to issue guidelines for ethical behavior on social media.\n\nThe following are high-profile hoaxes that tricked Indonesian presidents, as quoted by Koran Tempo\'s January 23rd edition.\n\nMarried couple Idrus and Markonah claimed to be the King and Queen of Suku Anak Dalam indigenous people in Sumatra in the 1950s. They embarked tours to regions across Indonesia in support of West Irian liberation from Dutch imperialism.\n\nThe Palace heard the news. They were invited by a state official to meet with President Soekarno who needed support to liberate West Irian. Idrus and Markonah met with President Soekarno and were treated like honorable guests.\n\nTheir identity was revealed when they had a walk in a market in Jakarta. A pedicab driver identified the two since Idrus was his fellow pedicab driver. Markonah was a sex worker. It was the first high-profile hoax that duped Indonesian president.\n\nIn the 1970s, an unborn child of Acehnese women Cut Zahara Fona was said to be capable of talking and reciting the Quran. The info shook Indonesia and made it to the newspapers. State official Adam Malik and the first lady Tien Soeharto were also aware of the news. Both summoned Cut Zahara to the Presidential Palace.\n\nAdam and Tien personally heard Cut Zahara\'s unborn child recite the Quran. The news got even bigger. But a physician named Herman did not believe it, noting that a fetus could not breathe nor make a sound. Consequently, Herman was threatened to be killed by Cut Zaharas sympathizers. Her lies were finally revealed: she put a tape recorder on her belly.\n\nIn 2002, the Religious Affairs Minister Said Agil Al Munawar claimed that he was told about treasures belonging to Prabu Siliwangi, the King of Padjadjaran, in Batu Tulis, Bogor. He forwarded the info to Megawati. Megawati appointed Said Agil as the leader to dig out the treasures that were said to be enough to pay off the national debts. Said Agil later stopped the excavation. No treasure was found.\n\nThe news about water to fuel conversion (blue energy) in 2008 broke out. The inventor Joko Suprapto presented his innovation before President SBY, securing Rp10 billion to build theblue energy plant in Cikeas, Bogor. The invention was slammed by many, including the Gadjah Mada University, who said that it was all lies. Joko later apologized for being unable to turn water into fuel. He was later named a suspect by Yogyakarta Police.\n\nNews reporting about 10 million Chinese migrant workers entering Indonesia surfaced in both social media and online media at the end of 2016. The government dismissed the rumor, citing that Indonesia only houses 21,000 Chinese migrant workers of a total 74,000 foreign workers. The fake news story prompted President Joko Widodo to revive the plan to establish the National Cyber Agency.

Another personal reason is absence of courage to denounce corrupt behavior. In such situation, a person is well aware of corruption, but keeps quiet. Those people usually cover illegitimate affairs because of cowardice or some other factors.\n\nThey think, it is not their problem and there is no necessity to make lives more complicated. Besides, the cause might be a decline in ethical sensitivity. Past negative experience or perverse conduct might lead to it. Sometimes a politician just does not have a sense of service. S/he does not understand that their duty is to work for good of people. Selfish desires and interests take the first place.\n\nCultural. Sometimes the environment itself condones corruption. People around may keep saying a person is pretty smart, for example, to avoid taxes. Or they may say, everyone does it. Thus, the moral basis may just vanish. One more factor is lack of transparency (mostly in the work of various public institutions). When no one is able to see what person does, it can provoke corruption acts.\n\nInstitutional. Inefficient regulations also lead to these illegal acts. The regions and countries, which are more liable to it, must create more effective mechanisms to fight corruption. Another reason is unreliable judicial process. It happens to be really hard to punish anyone for taking bribes, as the process is too slow and the crime might be even forgotten with the time. Moreover, lots of judges are corrupt as well.\n\nOrganizational. When someone is getting promotion, there are no moral criteria. However, the person in power must be responsible and honest. But people usually get power just for their loyalty to those, who\'re controlling a particular party. Skills and abilities are not taken into account. Of course, they are important, but we need to consider the other things as well. It happens that person has made a mistake by promoting a corrupt man. Nevertheless, in the majority of cases, this fact is simply ignored. It frequently happens that corrupt charges are downplayed. Punishment is too slight or there is no punishment at all. It leads to the further illegal acts.\n\nIt\'s vital to know the possible causes, especially in the most corrupt countries in the world. They will help to create a pack of measure to fight corruption in a very effective way.\n\nAlong with the reasons, corruption has its negative consequences. Thus, the most corrupt nationsin the world suffer a lot. It affects various spheres of life. The most widespread effects are as follows:\n\nFinances are very important part of life for every state. Corruption makes them disappear. However, all the politicians must remember the definition of leadership. They must direct and help themselves and other people to do the right thing to move forward. Illegal acts are not what any country wants and needs.','2017-03-25 03:51:12'),(211,28,'2325c036791829c1c1fc1b73dd87eef823784a1b536568079dfec68904490b79','bed844ba4f104bd7957f2465fa9672ee','','','How will you recover?

He and his wife allegedly spent over $1 million on personal items, and $100 million was said to be diverted into Alemns election campaign. It wasnt until roughly a year later that he was officially charged with corruption, embezzlement and money laundering among other things.\n\nAdd extortion, money laundering and wire fraud to this former-Ukraine prime ministers portfolio. To end a short, one year term, Pavlo Lazarenko was apprehended by authorities in December of 1998 on allegations of money laundering, but was later released on bail. In 2000, Pavlo Lazarenko was charged with the killing of high-ranking politician Yevhen Shcherban as well as two assassination attempts on other officials. In 2006, he was imprisoned for nine years in the U.S.A. on charges of fraud, money laundering and corruption. The United Nations claimLazarenko was responsible for the embezzlement of roughly $200 million over a one-year period.\n\nWith a ten-year term under his belt, Alberto Fujimori has served much longer than most politicians with such a troubling history. In light of a corruption scandal, Alberto Fujimoris Peruvian presidency screeched to a halt as he fled for Japan, running away from charges against him. Upon landing in Japan, he tried to resign as president, though his resignation was rejected by congress, who preferred to impeach him instead. In 2009, Alberto Fujimori was ultimately imprisoned for 25 years on account of humans rights violations.\n\nJean-Claude Duvalier was president of Haiti for a whopping 15 years. Duvalier had a publicly funded $2 million wedding, if that gives you a feel for his appreciation of his countrys money. He was a gruesome dictator, under whom many Haitians endured execution and torture. Unlike many of the leaders on this list, Duvalier died a free man. Although he was arrested by Haiti police after fleeing (and then coming back to) the country, he had died of a heart attack before the courts had finished with him. It is said he embezzled anywhere between $300 million to $800 million during his reign of terror.\n\nSlobodan Miloevi embezzled $1 billion during his presidency in Serbia. After bringing the Socialist Party of Serbia to power, Slobodan Miloevi lasted in office for 9 years before losing his presidency after an election he called early out of his own free will. He then went on to be the president of Yugoslavia for three years. One year later, he was put on trial under allegations of war crimes. Although he claimed the trial was, according to the UN Charter, illegal, he was held on trial until his death in 2006. He also faced charges for the embezzlement of a whopping $1 billion dollars, making him the fifth most corrupted leader of all time. Much like Duvalier, Slobodan Miloevi died of a heart attack during his trials.\n\nOriginally a general within the Nigerian army, Sani Abacha later became the head of state in Nigeria for quite some time. His was the first presidency to see massive-scale economy growth throughout recent history in Nigeria. He was a bit of a double-edged sword; however, due to his controversial reign involving myriad human rights issues. But were all here for the money, so lets get down to it. While the exact figure is unknown, its been estimated that Abacha and several of his associates embezzled between $2 billion and $5 billion.\n\nThe infamous dictator of the Republic of the Congo. Mobutu Sese Seko was known for many things  human rights violations, authoritariansm and cultural purging, to name a few  one thing not as many people are aware of was the corruption rampant throughout his governments rule. It is believed he embezzled a large amount of money, roughly $5 billion, during his reign of terror (although the exact figure has been debated).\n\nFerdinand Marcos was a Filipino president for an entire 21 years. During his presidency, Marcos embezzled $5 to $10 billion and was acquitted in the U.S.A. on embezzlement charges while simultaneously facing hundreds of charges of corruption in his home country. As if that wasnt enough, he was a fairly gruesome leader as well.\n\nThis is it, the most corrupted leader in all of history. After playing a part in World War Two as a solder for the army of the Netherlands, Mohamed Suharto later went on to become the second president of Indonesia  a title which he held for 31 years straight. Unlike most in his circumstance, Suharto was not impeached; he resigned after he 31 years of presidency, although his resignation was said to have little to do with his own free will, due to the countrys then-discontent toward his leadership. During his presidency he and his family managed to steal up to $35 billion, earning Suharto the title of the worlds most corrupted leader.','2017-03-25 03:51:12'),(214,28,'2325c036791829c1c1fc1b73dd87eef823784a1b536568079dfec68904490b79','b6b75c325b474623a7ed697bc7862a4d','','','1.

With his family\'s takings estimated at between $15 billion and $35 billion, Suharto topped such notorious kleptocrats as Ferdinand Marcos of the Philippines ($5 billion to $10 billion) and Nigeria\'s Sani Abacha ($2 billion to $5 billion). How did the longtime Indonesian strongman amass his wealth?\n\nThrough a system that his political opponents called KKN, the Indonesian acronym for \"corruption, collusion, nepotism.\" Suharto handed control of state-run monopolies to family members and friends, who in turn kicked back millions in tribute payments. Those payments were usually cloaked as charitable donations to the dozens of foundations overseen by Suharto. Known as yayasans, these organizations were supposed to assist with the constructions of rural schools and hospitals but instead functioned as Suharto\'s personal piggy banks. Doling out millions to one of the foundations was simply part of the cost of doing business in Indonesia during much of Suharto\'s 32-year reign. Financial institutions were ordered to contribute a portion of their annual profits to a yayasan, for example, and wealthy Indonesians were expected to \"tithe\" a certain percentage of their salaries.\n\nThe charitable foundations were only the tip of the KKN iceberg. In order to exploit Indonesia\'s natural resources, companies had to enlist the aid of a Suharto cronyusually one of his childrenin order to get through the bureaucratic red tape. In return, the cronies expected an equity stake in the enterprise, without putting forth any monetary capital. When Jakarta\'s water system was privatized in the mid-1990s, for example, one of the winning bidders had to give Suharto\'s son, Sigit, 20 percent of the venture\'s shares. Sigit\'s involvement with the company amounted to showing up for the contract-signing ceremony.\n\nSuharto and his clan also used services firms to siphon cash from larger companies. The most famous example concerns Pertamina, the state oil company. According to a 1999 expos in Time Asia, Pertamina was forced to import and export its oil through two Suharto-family trading companies, which charged up to 35 cents a barrel for the service. Other Suharto-related companies enjoyed favorable contracts to provide the oil monopoly with everything from cafeteria food to insurance. When Pertamina\'s books were finally audited in July1999, it was estimated that at least $6.1 billion had been stolen in this manner.\n\nSuharto-affiliated companies could also borrow money from Bank Indonesia, the central bank, without paying back a dime. International accounting standards were pretty much ignored in Indonesia prior to Suharto\'s downfall in 1998, and there was little pressure on the nation\'s oligarchs to make good on their debt obligations.\n\nSuharto made only token gestures toward combating corruption, and they were largely confined to the first decade or so of his rule. A 1977 program called \"Operation Orderliness,\" for example, was supposed to curtail cronyism, but it ended up targeting only small-fry civil servants. Suharto was supposed to face trial in 2000, in relation to approximately $571 million he embezzled from the yayasans, but doctors ruled that he was too ill to withstand court proceedings. (Indonesian prosecutors tried again in 2002, but physicians still insist that Suharto\'s unspecified \"brain disease\" is serious enough to prevent a trial.) Nonetheless, his family\'s representatives have vigorously denied the corruption charges, even going so far as to sue Time Asia over its muckraking storya lawsuit that was dismissed for lack of evidence. That article was actually somewhat kind to Suharto, in that it pegged his family\'s fortune at the relatively lowball figure of $15 billion.','2017-03-25 03:51:12'),(216,28,'2325c036791829c1c1fc1b73dd87eef823784a1b536568079dfec68904490b79','edaea8dc5c0a4dde9a7c683340bfcc1c','','','Integrated and customised prevention and control strategies for fraud-proofing an organisation.','2017-03-25 03:51:12'),(217,29,'26826b83fcd949a64704549e4b0a12e9f0ee78a9c15ec99eff157663c75a976a','c5b56a1bb556413b8a9dbd723ff3f8f3','','','Welcome to FunTrivia\'s section!\n\n \n\n \n\n Ask FunTrivia strives to be the most accurate and complete source for answers to trivia questions on the web. \n\n\n\n Please cite all facts with citation links or references from trustable sources.

This weeks fake news about a petition to VP-elect Mike Pence, demanding a moratorium on instruction about evolution, gives a hint of what may be to come. Atheist activists jumped on the petition as evidence of what the semi-mythic Christian Right has in store for the next four years. The petitions creator, though, characterized it as tongue-in-cheek.\n\nWhile Pence along with Trumps HUD pick, Ben Carson, have commented in the past on questions of evolutionary origins and intelligent design, the focus is likely to be on Mr. Trumps choice for Secretary of Education, Betsy DeVos. In The New Yorker, outspoken atheist cosmologist Lawrence Krauss has already sounded the alarm (Donald Trumps War on Science).\n\nAs evidence against Mrs. DeVos, he cites her church membership and college majors (business administration and political science, rather than education). Krauss admits she has no record of saying anything at all about evolution, but her husband, Dick DeVos, in a run for governor of Michigan, had this to say:\n\nThe structure of the sentence by itself tells you that it was a casual remark. Granting Mr. DeVos the benefit of the doubt, it wouldnt be the first time that a political aspirant invoked ID in such a context without having researched what ID means or what its advocates say. Notably, Discovery Institute, the major force in supporting research on intelligent design, strongly opposes requiring ID in public schools, and always has opposed it. (See our Science Education Policy.)\n\nInstead, we call for permitting teachers to challenge students with an approach to evolution that sharpens their critical skills, using mainstream scientific sources to examine the strengths and weaknesses of standard neo-Darwinian theory. Two states (Tennessee and Louisiana) and multiple school districts have adopted this policy of academic freedom, teaching about legitimate disagreements among mainstream scientists.\n\nBut when did a little thing like accuracy trouble a Darwin activist equipped with a media bullhorn? Krauss inveighs:\n\nThe day that Donald Trump won the 2016 presidential election, senior biologists and other scientists were gathering at Londons venerable Royal Society, where Isaac Newton once presided, for a conference to discuss controversies rocking the study of evolution. Those include what the first speaker at the event, Austrian evolutionary biologist Gerd Mller, called the major explanatory deficits of textbook Darwinian theory. A teach the controversy approach would invite students to weigh those deficits. By the way, it might surprise Dr. Krauss to hear that approximately 10 percent of the scholars gathered for the three-day meeting were, in fact, intelligent-design advocates or sympathizers. (We know who they were and counted them.)\n\nTo compare these sophisticated, enlightening disagreements to whether the sun orbits Earth or vice versa, you would have to be either ignorant or dishonest. Since Krauss participated in a debate this year with ID advocate Stephen Meyer, author of Darwins Doubt and Signature in the Cell, he cant be utterly ignorant of what design theorists say.\n\nKrauss goes on to demand that Mrs. DeVos be interrogated on her beliefs regarding ID:\n\nBy all means, lawmakers should ask her any relevant questions they care to, although the point about Young Earth Creationism would be mere badgering, intended to smear her. If shes queried on ID, though, what should she say?\n\nFirst of all, it isnt the role of the Secretary of Education to dictate science education policy to states or localities. Ramesh Ponnuru at National Review Online makes this point, I hope DeVos will muster the patience to explain that the Department of Education does not (and should not) determine schools science curricula. Its because it does not that Krauss is unable to explain how DeVos could drive our educational system off a scientific cliff.\' True, as far it goes. However, one hopes for an Education Secretary with some vision to impart, beyond merely setting policies.\n\nTherefore, second, Mrs. DeVos could note the benefits of teaching students to think and write critically about a complex, fascinating scientific issue like evolution. Again, this is not about intelligent design, much less about Biblical literalist creationism. The unsolved problems of Darwinian theory include those highlighted by Gerd Mller: among them, how to explain phenotypic complexity, phenotypic novelty, and dramatic discontinuities in the fossil record.\n\nIt isnt just ID proponents who ask about these issues. Nor do you have to take our word for it on the benefits. As the worlds most distinguished science journal, Nature, has observed, [S]tudents gain a much deeper understanding of science when they actively grapple with questions than when they passively listen to answers.\n\nFinally, Mrs. DeVos could note that academic freedom laws are called that because they are meant to ensure freedom for instructors to engage in creative pedagogy rather than merely regurgitating the same evolutionary talking points year after year. The aim is to protect excellent teachers from career retaliation, a threat always in the air when evolution is challenged.\n\nEarlier this year, University of Chicago president Robert J. Zimmer won plaudits for a Wall Street Journal op-ed, Free Speech Is the Basis of a True Education. Among other welcome observations, he decried efforts to suppress discussion of Charles Darwins work. While he may have been thinking of the historical past, suppressing discussion is always a bad idea, and allowing open debate is always the basis of a true education.\n\nMrs. DeVos could cite Dr. Zimmer. Indeed, she could quote Lawrence Krauss himself in the same New Yorker article:\n\nRight! And since its not some principle laid down on high, it should be fair game for criticism. Unfortunately textbook Darwinism has failed some conspicuous empirical tests, as scientists increasingly acknowledge, at least in their professional conclaves when they think the public isnt listening. Mrs. DeVos could and should advocate that this fact not be withheld from young people.','2017-03-25 03:51:12'),(224,30,'291aade3c15dbd0d6401c0ec426d8ad4aea858487330518097f0135c15cd33ce','795bcba95ee74f1bab45986a6b5ad571','','','In a rare move, the Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon decided to get a little political last night by doing a bit featuring newly-confirmed Education Secretary Betsy Devos, portrayed by talented New York comedianne Jo Firestone.\n\nThe bit opens up with DeVos unsurprisingly facing the wrong way, and the segment included a series of comedic missteps from the woman who needed Vice President Mike Pences decisive final vote to reach full confirmation earlier this week.

If its not important enough to be mentioned in the Bible, Secretary DeVos stated, I dont see why its important enough to be in our texbooks [sic].\n\nDeVos was further quoted as saying, Nothing that has happened in the last two thousand years is really all that important, not enough to teach our kids about, anyway.\n\nHowever, both of these shocking quotes, along with the rest ofarticle in which they are found, are completely fictitious.

This and other posts on the site are clearly labeled Humor/Satire,and a disclaimer on the site says:\n\nThe article riffs onDeVos reputation as a churchgoer and advocate of private (including home and faith-based) schools who once saidthat her goalis to confront the culture in which we all live today in wayswhichwill continue to advance Gods kingdom.\n\nWe have found no instances of her making public statements to the effect that history textbooks ought to be based on the Bible, however.

When I told my friends and family that I was returning home because my husband had been recruited back to his former position with the State of New Jersey, they unanimously cried Why are you coming home to this mess of racial conflict, gun violence and the scary rise of the bigoted conservative right? I shrugged, explaining that my husband hadnt found satisfying employment in his rarified field of GIS map making and he missed his beloved workmates in Trenton who took him out every Friday for tomato pie at DLorenzos. I missed bagels, decent frozen yogurt and my family and friends who never came to visit because merely contemplating the idea of 20 hours on an airplane sent them into fits of panic and hysteria.\n\nThough I was coming back home to live, I explained that I wasnt REALLY leaving New Zealand because I was a permanent resident and could continue to vote in all New Zealand elections. That status was not going to change because we were keeping our wonderful home in Hawkes Bay on the East Coast of the North Island where I was able to grow everything from artichokes to heirloom tomatoes when in all my years of living in Manhattan, I was only able to keep a single fig tree alive and that was because my lovely cleaner kept on repotting it. Also, after we sold our wonderful one-bedroom apartment on the Upper West Side, we SHLEPPED all our possessions including 40 boxes of my books and music across the world, and there was no way I was going to SHLEP it all the way back home. I insisted that we were going to return to New Zealand to retire but, most importantly, I had fallen in love with my adopted country and our wonderful life there. So Ruth Bader Ginsberg, as in all things, is right, even though real paradises have their own tzuris. These are a few of the reasons why.\n\nNew Zealand is a twin island nation that is the size of the United Kingdom with a population struggling to reach 4.5 million, of which nearly 1.5 million live in the megalopolis which is Auckland. It really does look like the vistas captured in Peter Jacksons LORD OF THE RINGS. You can drive for miles and see only the occasional sheep and walrus lounging on the rocks. Though the land and sea are not as clean and green as advertised (one of the aforementioned tzuris), it still makes you sing Bali Hai from South Pacific when you approach an unexpected verdant vista, and you can walk for miles and not see another human being, which is amazing for ones serenity, but not so great if you are in desperate need of intense political conversation. But then again, paradise is supposed to be restful.The city of Queenstown is the adventure capital of the world where snow capped alpine slopes surround green and blue lakes and every cliff becomes another opportunity to bungee jump, paraglide, zipline, snowboard or simply hike. There are first class white water rafting courses and jet boats that take the corners of canyon streams with the swift accuracy of formula one cars. The cultivated walks are some of the most beautiful in the world, where huts are populated with rangers who share their sense of humour with Bret and Jermaine of The Flight of the Concords. Even the birds have a sense of humor. Moreporks get their name from their cries, Keas (large native parrots) entertain themselves by eating the rubber off windshield wipers and stealing hikers laundry off clotheslines. Lovely fantails circle your head when you are walking through the bush, not because they like you but because you are stirring up their feast of insects.\n\nThis was mostly because women headed the Temperance Party and were eager to get their men home from late nights at the pub, but thats beside the point. Women of all colours, shapes, religions, races and creeds have prominent positions in government, business and the arts, and former Prime Minister, Helen Clark, is currently the Administrator of the United Nations Development Program, in line for the position of Secretary General and recently voted the 22nd most powerful woman in the world by Forbes Magazine. Georgina Beyer was the first openly transexual member of Parliament anywhere and Prime Ministers vie for photo opportunities at Gay Days Out. Its indigenous population, the Maori, were the only indigenous people not to be defeated by the British colonializers in battle but arrived at a settlement through the historic Treaty of Waitangi. Though far from perfect, and still a source of mighty tzuris for many of the local iwi, or tribes, the Maori have strong political voices that demand to be heard and are a force to be reckoned with.\n\nReligions are accepted but do not mandate or control national law. As a Jew, you have to go to the major cities to buy matzo for Passover, but there are synagogues of reform and orthodox denominations throughout the country, including Dunedin which boasts the Southernmost Jewish congregation in the world, and where I was a lay rabbi during our tenure there at the turn of the millenium.\n\nEvery town seems to have its own roaster. Flat whites, long blacks, short blacks and cappuccinos are made individually by hand.\n\nIts red wines are becoming extraordinary.\n\nthat you have an excuse not to visit the relatives who give you instant headaches or see those friends who have continually spoken behind your back.\n\nEvery year, the New Zealand International Film Festival brings the best world cinema to every excellent venue in the country. The national ballets, orchestras and opera companies are world class and they travel. Because entertainers no longer earn buckets from album sales, they now come to New Zealand. Even Madonna and Coldplay.\n\nEven a New York writer can become the host of a local television interview program.\n\nDo I need to say more? All prescriptions that arent extraordinary cost $5.\n\nOnly tasers, and even when they stop New York girls to give them speeding tickets, they apologise for the inconvenience.\n\nSo, in other words, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Jewess extraordinaire, knows what shes talking about. And though I hope that Donald Trump doesnt win, and that she NEVER retires, if she does, I will welcome her to the Hawkes Bay, take her to the local Festival Opera during Napiers Art Deco weekend and toast the future of women in power and worldly paradises.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed in this article are the authors own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Forward.','2017-03-25 03:51:12'),(231,31,'29377ecddf1b2c7fd2d612150a61c34a7be556f1d7332772104ffb8417845c16','f3007a1ed64a413fb21a69bd1d2b5737','','','In a July New York Times interview, Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg famously said she couldnt imagine what the country would be with Donald Trump as our president  a statement for which she subsequently apologized.\n\nBut now that Trump is indeed the countrys president-elect, it appears she may still be having some trouble with her ability to imagine.\n\nGinsburg appeared on the bench Wednesday morning wearing her dissent jabot or collar she regularly wears when issuing dissenting opinions on cases before the Court.\n\nIn a 2014 interview, Ginsburg revealed she has several collars that she wears at court that reflect whether she is in the majority or minority on rulings.\n\nTodays fashion statement has been interpreted by many as Ginsburg registering her protest to the outcome of Tuesdays vote.\n\nGinsburg and Trump tangled in July following the justices criticism of the GOP candidate.\n\nI cant imagine what this place would be  I cant imagine what the country would be  with Donald Trump as our president  For the country, it could be four years.

Jolie peered into the bucket and picked out one of the writhing creatures, studying it as it found its way to one of the prominent veins on the back of her hand and locked on. As it started to gorge on her blood, she carried it over to her nine-year-old lead actor, Sareum Srey Moch, who was sitting in a canvas chair in the shade of a tree.\n\nThis is what a real one looks like, she said. Sareum wrinkled her nose and stared at the leech. Does it suck your blood? the girl asked. Jolies 13-year-old son, Pax, on crutches after breaking his foot in a jet-ski accident, hobbled over with his camera to take a closer look.\n\nYes it sucks your blood, Jolie answered after a slight hesitation, already resigned to the likelihood that live leeches might be a step too far for this young actor. She ordered a return to plan A, a box full of dozens of pretend leeches made out of black vinyl and double-pinned to a cardboard backing like biological specimens. The crew experimented with gluing plastic worms of different shapes to Sareums leg until both the child actor and Jolie agreed that it looked right. Actor and director high-fived each other and the girl walked back to the paddy field for her next scene.\n\nSareum plays the part of Loung Ung, who was only five when the Khmer Rouge, as Cambodias communist party was known, swept into the capital Phnom Penh in 1975. Over the next four years, they drove its population out into the countryside, executing all those perceived as class enemies. More than two million people were killed, out of a total population of seven million. Ungs father and mother and two of her sisters were executed.\n\nAt nine, Ung escaped to Thailand with her older brother, and they arrived in the US as refugees soon afterwards, with the help of a church foundation. At 30, she wrote her autobiography, First They Killed My Father. On set, Loung Ung, now aged 46, watched playbacks on a screen with Jolie in a small black tent, next to a little corral where brown cattle were being kept for farm scenes. The two women have been friends for 16 years and Ung, who co-wrote the screenplay, was working as a consultant on the set.\n\nJolie dates the beginning of her involvement in humanitarian issues to her experience making the fantasy action movie, Lara Croft: Tomb Raider, in 2000. In that film, which was released in 2001, Cambodia was no more than an exotic backdrop for the action, but booby-traps and anti-personnel mines planted all over the country in the 1970s were still going off. There was a generation of orphans, then in their twenties, and a country still crushed by poverty, authoritarianism and mass trauma. Soon after filming Tomb Raider was over, Jolie returned as a volunteer for the UN refugee agency, UNHCR, and visiting mine clearance projects. She started giving large amounts of money to UNHCR and became a goodwill ambassador for the organisation.\n\nJolie was planning to return to Cambodia with UNHCR later in 2001 when Ungs autobiography landed on her desk. Ung at that time was working for a US Vietnam veterans organisation supporting landmine victims in the region. Her office had sent the book to Jolie on the off chance that she might publicise its cause. As soon as Jolie read the book she called Ung. It turned out the two women were to be in Cambodia at the same time. Jolie invited Ung to join her on a motorbike tour of the rugged countryside around the Battambang province in the north-west of the country.\n\nWe travelled to some very remote areas  there were no roads, or hotels or restaurants, Ung said. We stopped at the roadsides and ate in peoples homes. And I was so impressed because Angie didnt travel with an entourage. She will eat whatever, shell hang her hammock wherever and get dirty and muddy in the torrential rain.\n\nUng taught Jolie the survival skills learned in the camp: how to check for leeches and catch frogs. We very quickly became friends, Jolie told me. We got caught in a monsoon and stayed up at night sitting in hammocks in a pagoda in the rain, which is really fun for the first few hours and then its just freezing cold and relentless.\n\nOne day, Jolie spent time playing and talking to children in a school in Battambang. She had no children at the time and says it was at that moment that she decided to adopt a child from the country. I asked Loung, as a Cambodian, as an orphan, what would she think about that. And she was very supportive about it, Jolie said. And we had a talk about what would be important, to make sure he always knew about himself. Jolie adopted Maddox Chivan, aged seven months, from a Battambang orphanage a year later, in March 2002. And Loungs been in his life ever since, she said.\n\nJolie and Ung began adapting the book, but then shelved the project in part because Jolie was busy with other movies and because neither thought the political atmosphere in Cambodia was conducive to making a film about recent history. However, last year, Maddox, by then 14, persuaded them to make the film. He was the one who just called it and said he was ready and that he wanted to work on it, which he did. He read the script, helped with notes, and was in the production meetings, Jolie said.\n\nIn 2011, Jolie made a film about the Bosnian conflict, In the Land of Blood and Honey, for which the cast was entirely made up of people from the former Yugoslavia. The film adaptation of First They Killed My Father uses only Cambodian actors, and the language spoken throughout is Khmer, with occasional snatches of French, the imperial language of French Indochina, of which Cambodia was a part until the 1950s.\n\nWhen I said I wanted to make this film and I want to make it in Cambodia, everyone said: you cant make it in Cambodia. You have to make it in Thailand, like The Killing Fields, Jolie said. Roland Joffs 1984 film was Hollywoods one major attempt to tackle the Cambodian genocide. It tells the story of a Cambodian photojournalist stranded after the evacuation of his western colleagues, who provide the western point of view for the audience. Jolies film makes no such concessions. There are no white characters to explain events in English and she is quite clear that the primary audience is the Cambodian public. The cast and crew are Cambodian.\n\nThe film will be launched across Cambodia in the middle of next month, seven months ahead of its release in the US.\n\nJolies humanitarian work marks the third act of her career. Although not the first actor to take this route, she has thrown herself into the role. Im doing less film now, she said. Not walking away from it all, but ideally doing projects like this one, where you can pull together all that matters to you at the same time.\n\nWhile filming scenes that took place in a Khmer Rouge camp for child labourers, Jolie  barefoot and wearing a T-shirt and a large straw hat  strode on to the dusty set after every few takes. It was mid-morning and the heat was still bearable. The atmosphere was of a sprawling, busy, extended family, particularly during the communal meals eaten under canvas. Jolie was relaxed and happy, laughing and joking.\n\nShe was clearly in her preferred element, at work but surrounded by close friends and family, and protected  by the remoteness of location and light set security  from the worlds curiosity about her private life. She said later in the day that one of the things she most liked about being in Cambodia was that she would wander in the markets and those people who recognised her, knew her for her philanthropy. Maybe theyve seen Tomb Raider but they dont really watch a lot of movies, she said. Really, Im that odd nice lady who likes Cambodia. If I go to the market, they do recognise me  they just dont bother me. They say hi.\n\nThe set, a cluster of open-sided wooden huts, was built around a large dirt drill yard hung with red flags. Long lines of young Khmer children in black pyjamas and red chequered bandanas marched up and down, in and out of shot. Others picked rice from a paddy as a drone camera hovered noisily above.\n\nMost of the time, Ungs role was as an auntie figure to the child actors, particularly Sareum (who she called Mini-Me), dispensing bottled water and advice and spending hours in the Lego tent. Lego is largely unknown in Cambodia because of the countrys strict restrictions on imports, but Jolie brought a large amount of the plastic building bricks with her to keep the children in the cast amused.\n\nFor Ung, the Lego tent symbolised the ultimate defeat of the Khmer Rouge. Lego is brightly coloured, its fun and its laziness. In the camp you would be beaten or worse for laziness, Ung said. Her sister, Chuo, witnessed a boy being beaten to death by camp guards who said he was idle.\n\nIn solidarity with the girls in the cast, who had to wear their hair in the severe short crop imposed by the Khmer Rouge, Ung had cut her hair and wore black. In breaks in the filming, she and Sareum strolled around as two versions of the same person, 40 years apart.\n\nWhen I met Mini-Me, we were both trying to suss each other out. We would walk around each other like roosters, she said. But she is constantly surprised at how alike they are. Mini-Me would do something and I would look at Angie and say: I do that!\n\nIn writing her autobiography, Ung sought to recapture what it felt like to experience the upheaval, chaos and horror of life in a child labour camp. The young Ung had only a fragmentary understanding of the events unfolding around her. The film seeks to do the same thing  to show conflict as seen through the eyes of a young girl. To allow the audience to see the world through the young Ungs eyes, much of the footage is filmed from her point-of-view, four feet off the ground with a Steadicam.\n\nThe pursuit of an authentic childs-eye view had been the films defining technical challenge. When filming adults you shoot over the shoulder and you frame each shot so that its interesting, said Jolie. With POV it is whatever Loung is focusing on at that moment. It has taken everyone, especially the cameramen, time to adjust and not to try to frame the shot as they normally would. After a last minute change, Anthony Dod Mantle was hired as cinematographer just a few days before filming began in earnest in November 2015.\n\nI felt like a Red Cross parcel thrown out of a B52 bomber, Mantle said. He is known as one of the most insistent innovators in the business and won an Oscar for his work in Mumbai on Danny Boyles 2008 film Slumdog Millionaire. Me and Angie are trying to egg each other on, to be radical.\n\nWatching her childhood experience of genocide played out on set had a visceral effect on Ung. After arriving in the US at the age of nine, Ung was dogged by a recurring dream of being chased by soldiers determined to kill her. She would wake up just as her pursuers grabbed her. She underwent the same torment night after night until finally, three years later, in a dream, she turned on one of her attackers.\n\nIn my dream, which I remember very vividly, I was in America and he was chasing me and I was running and running and running. I came into a house and there were no weapons there, but what I found was a knife. And I grabbed it and I was trying to cut his head off and it was a butter knife. And I had to really hack at it, Ung said. This was when I was about 12 or 13 years old.\n\nUng is short and slight, and her frequent smile and inclination to find the humour in almost any setting is at odds with the darkness of her life story. She described being happy as an act of will. As a young woman, she resolved that neither her parents nor her two lost sisters would want to see her spend her life consumed in misery. So I have purposefully made myself not do that, and the great thing about habits is if you do it long enough, it sticks.\n\nEven Ungs choice of career has involved the pursuit of pleasure. She and her husband, Mark Priemer, set up a microbrewery because they couldnt get decent beer in America. I thought if I die tomorrow I dont want to die drinking fizzy water, Ung said. The couple now run two breweries and three restaurants in Cleveland, Ohio.\n\nIts one of those things your girlfriend tells you, and you think: Oh what is she doing? Jolie recalled. And then I didnt even ask about it for a few years because I was worried. We talked about other things like books, and I turn around and she has a crazy number of employees and shes really successful. Its Brads favourite beer so I have it in my house all the time. (During the filming, Brad Pitt stayed much of the time in Siem Reap, the resort town close to the ruins of Angkor Wat, helping look after the couples children in what turned out to be the final months of their marriage.)\n\nBut now that Ung was back in Cambodia for a long period, her hair cut short and dressed in black again after years of wearing the brightest colours she could find, her bad dreams were returning.\n\nOver the course of making the film, she had broken down many times on set. People are always asking me about war as a survivor, she said. They always ask about the bombing, the deaths, the soldiers. And Ive always wanted to say that yes, those were horrible difficult moments, but having my hand separated from the clasp of my sisters, and seeing my parents being pulled away from each other, and having to walk away from my brothers and sisters  that was brutal.\n\nI hope people see not just the horror of war but the love it takes to survive.\n\nThe Khmer Rouge grew out of the communist ferment in south-east Asia that followed the second world war. The Cambodian communist party was taken over in the 1960s by a group of hardline ideologues who had studied in Paris, led by a radio engineer named Saloth Sar  a man who would later take the nom-de-guerre Pol Pot. The communist rebellion was seized upon by Lieutenant General Lon Nol, who ousted the countrys post-independence leader, Prince Sihanouk, in 1970, and countered the communist insurgency with heavy support from the US, which was conducting a secret and devastating bombing campaign along the countrys eastern border aimed at Viet Cong bases.\n\nIn its opening sequence, Jolies film uses news reports from the time to suggest that the US bombing campaign boosted support for the Khmer Rouge and contributed to the eventual collapse of Lon Nols forces in 1975. Loung Ungs father was a conscripted military police officer in Lon Nols army and high on the Khmer Rouge hit list. Those marked for death included anyone educated and therefore corrupted by western ways. Through mass murder, the Khmer Rouge intended to restart civilisation and turn back the clock to Year Zero.\n\nLast year, while Jolie was filming, I visited the grave of Pol Pot  the man who had presided over the killing fields. The forlorn and derelict site is in Anlong Veng, on Cambodias western border with Thailand, the location of the Khmer Rouges prolonged last stand against Vietnamese forces. He died in April 1998, aged 73, waiting for a car that was supposed to be taking him out of the country to appear before an international tribunal. According to the official account, the cause of death was heart failure, though other versions point to suicide or murder.\n\nA makeshift memorial stands over the spot where his body was cremated, amounting to no more than a strip of corrugated metal held up by two posts. A faded blue sign appeals to visitors to preserve this historic site, and it has been neither vandalised nor maintained. Dry grass has grown up around it.\n\nThe only signs of recent human presence were a small wilted bunch of lotuses, a couple of red candles and a small, locked red tin box. According to a watchman, the only regular visitor is a Thai businessman and gambler, to whom Pol Pot appeared in a dream 10 years ago and provided the winning lottery numbers. The watchman said the gambler comes once a month, taking a break from a new casino built on the border nearby, to leave flowers and fruit. More Thai gamblers have followed his example, hoping to emulate his luck, and recently visitor figures have risen to about 50 a month. With traffic on the rise, a new concrete booth is planned for the watchman.\n\nAnlong Veng was a Khmer Rouge stronghold for more than a decade. Most of the residents are either former regime officials or their descendants, but the vestiges of Kampuchea  as the Khmer Rouge renamed Cambodia  seem to excite no local interest today. A few miles from the neglected grave is the house of Ta Mok, Pol Pots military enforcer, and later his rival, jailer and possibly his killer. The squat concrete shell of the house looks out on to an artificial lake that Ta Mok had built, and he decorated the walls with murals of the Angkor Wat temples. The murals are now covered with graffiti scrawled by lovers inspired by the romantic views.\n\nThe local government half-heartedly advertises the place to sightseers and a handful pass by each day. Kearn Sarin, a stocky man in a military jacket and a chequered Khmer scarf around an olive green cap, works there as a guide. Kearn was a bodyguard for Ta Mok until he was arrested in 1999. Ta Mok died in 2006 awaiting trial for genocide and crimes against humanity.\n\nKearn remains a staunch defender of the Khmer Rouge, which he first joined as a teenager. He had heard about Ungs book and the film, but dismissed it as one persons propaganda. It doesnt tell the good actions done by the Khmer Rouge, he said. In Kampuchea, there was no rich or poor. Everyone was on the same simple level. Now the gap between rich and poor is big again.\n\nThere are various small-scale shrines and memorials to the genocide around Cambodia, but there is only one war museum, in Siem Reap, where the hulks of ruined Soviet-era armoured cars, tanks and helicopters sit under a grove of mango trees. On either side, there are old guns stacked on wooden stands and a rather patchy account of the countrys long nightmare. Behind a pane of glass, a one-page summary of the Khmer Rouge regime makes no mention of the killing fields and the two million dead, just a radical attempt at social engineering. Other pictures on display are Khmer Rouge propaganda shots, most of them labelled: Khmer Rouge troops go from place to place.\n\nVery few Cambodians come to the museum. People dont talk about the war. They dont want to, said Moun Sinath, who works as a guide at the museum. It is difficult to talk about because there are some of the Khmer Rouge people still running the government.\n\nA foreigner coming to Cambodia to make a film about such an excruciatingly painful episode in the countrys history faces a delicate task. Every step along the way, from securing permission to film, to arranging movie screenings, has required patient negotiation. Not only are many former Khmer Rouge members still in positions of influence, Jolie had to navigate deep scepticism about foreigners in general. As Youk Chhang, the executive director of the Documentation Centre of Cambodia (an NGO dedicated to researching the history of Cambodia under the Khmer Rouge), points out, between occupation by the French, the later invasion by the Vietnamese and repeated bombing raids by the US, there is a lot for Cambodians to be wary about.\n\nChhang is a supporter of Jolies film, but he said there were some, including the countrys young film-makers, who felt they were better placed to tell the defining story of their parents lives. It has to be understood that Cambodians mistrust of foreigners has deep roots, he said.\n\nHowever, Jolie is a Cambodian citizen  she was awarded the honour in 2005 in recognition of her conservation work  and she has a Cambodian son. Furthermore she undertook the project as part of a team with Ung, her co-producer Rithy Panh, who is an internationally celebrated film-maker in his own right, and an all-Cambodian cast.\n\nBecause I did it in partnership with Luong and Rithy, it really wasnt me leading it. It never was. And every day on set, it really wasnt. I had to always defer to the Cambodian people who were there, Jolie told me. Its not my story.\n\nThese partnerships, and Jolies own diplomatic skills, also helped smooth the way with the government in Phnom Penh.\n\nCambodias quiet ambivalence about its own genocide goes to the heart of the establishment. Hun Sen, Cambodias prime minister since 1985, was a battalion commander in the Khmer Rouge but fled with his unit to Vietnam to escape a party purge in 1977. He was subsequently a commander of Cambodian rebels that formed part of the Vietnamese invasion force two years later, and was originally part of the government set up under the Vietnamese occupation. Since then he has presided over a managed semi-democracy, in which elections are held, but with a carefully controlled media and widespread allegations of vote rigging.\n\nA joint UN-Cambodian court was set up in 2006 to try surviving Khmer Rouge leaders, but Hun Sens government limited its scope. Just five former leaders have been indicted  three were convicted and two died during their trials. Wider public debate on the genocide has been discouraged by the government until recently. The basic facts of what happened under Khmer Rouge rule only began to be taught in Cambodian schools four years ago. Jolies film is being made at a moment of transformation.\n\nA decade ago to talk about certain things [felt] very different than it does today. I dont know what that is attributed to. It could be because its a certain generation change, Jolie said.\n\nBut I wondered if there were would be restrictions over making the film. I wondered if theyd say: You cant do this here or here, because the country is too sensitive and we dont want to see this in the streets. Or maybe someone would say, Oh it wasnt as bad as this  its blown out of proportion; or some kind of advice to tone it down. But quite the opposite  weve had encouragement to be as accurate as possible.\n\nThe world premiere of First They Killed My Father will be held in Siem Reap on 18 February, seven months before its global release via Netflix. I went to [Netflix] directly, Jolie said, because I want to make the kind of film where I dont have to compromise and put a famous Chinese actress in as the mother, or make it in a different language in order to get people in the theatres on the first weekend.\n\nAfter all the labour camp scenes had been filmed, the crew had to set fire to the wooden huts for one of the climactic moments of Ungs story, an attack on the camp during the Vietnamese offensive of 1979. Pyrotechnic specialists spent an afternoon rigging up burners and priming the straw roofs of the huts with fuel.\n\nThere would be just a narrow window for filming a long tracking shot following the young Ung into the blaze, and Jolie was in her black tent planning it. She had been violently sick the night before and looked frail but insisted she had stabilised. The shoot only had a few insurance days to cover the cost of over-runs, so nobody, least of all the director, could afford to be sick for long. Other crew members had collapsed or succumbed to hallucinations while trying to work through sickness.\n\nJolie was trying to determine whether it would have been a mortar or rocket that set the camp alight, and how each would make it burn. An added complication was the fact that the local farmer did not want any damage done to his wooden hut. A fire truck would be parked nearby in case it was ignited by stray sparks.\n\nAs the evening darkened on the set, the wooden huts were set alight, and Sareum, playing the young Ung, was filmed running across the parade ground surrounded by flames, calling for her sister. In a nearby field, children were running away from the flames, followed noisily by a pig. Actors playing Khmer Rouge soldiers ran the other way across the open field carrying AK-47s. A row of latex corpses of dead fighters had been lined up under a tree ready for dispersal around the battlefield.\n\nOff to the side of the field, most of the crew had turned up to watch the set go up in flames. Brad Pitt, in a flat cap and T-shirt, had come with four of the couples children.\n\nIt is hard to predict what the emotional response of Cambodians to the film will be, but for those of the cast and crew old enough to remember the Khmer Rouge, the effect of making it has been devastating.\n\nHere everyone has been through it. Everybody is standing 10 feet away from someone else who has been through it. Theyve been helping each other as they always have, Jolie told me. Before shooting started, she had made sure there was a Cambodian nurse with on set with experience of working with post traumatic stress.\n\nPeople were so badly treated and so dehumanised, said co-producer Rithy Panh, they had no great desire to recall what happened, to talk about when they had to eat roots and insects to survive. And what could they say? I am alone, I survived but I couldnt save my parents? I find this long silence normal.\n\nPanh was 11 in 1975. He too lost his parents and siblings and ended up in a Thai refugee camp in 1979. Out of a dozen-strong household in Phnom Penh when the city fell, only he and one older sister survived. Now aged 52, Panh is a softly spoken man with round head and a goatee shielded by a wide-brimmed hat. He was seated at a desk in a recreation of a Khmer Rouge classroom with a straw roof and no walls.\n\nPanhs documentaries were the first to break the Cambodian silence. In his 2003 film about Tuol Sleng, the most murderous of Khmer Rouge prisons, known as S-21, the handful of survivors from the jail confronted their former prison guards. His films won prizes abroad, but were barely seen in Cambodia. People were saying I should make films about how beautiful the country is, he said. Its only the young who watch my films.\n\nThe film that Angelina is making is important because it perhaps permits a new generation of young people to find out what happened to their grandparents. Its not the sole solution. Its just images, but it makes them able to face up to their history and understand.\n\nFinally, Panh added, the film demonstrates his countrys resilience. They couldnt destroy us. This creative act shows that we are able to express our history. There are those who say that after all that happened here, poetry is not possible any more. But I say we need more poetry. We need poetry, for creation, for imagination, to allow people to come through all this, turn their back on it and move forward.\n\nWith a month to go before the film is shown in Cambodia, Jolie was at home in California, fretting about the complication of what general release might mean in a country largely without cinemas and a population that has not confronted the realities of its genocide.\n\nThere are many smaller screenings we are going to be doing, which I am most excited by. It may just be a sheet and a projector out in a pagoda in the more remote areas, she told me in a recent telephone interview.\n\nWhether it will be possible to show such a film in the Cambodian countryside will depend on the availability of monks or therapists to help organise the screening and deal with the fallout. There will be time set aside for discussions after the screenings, and in some places Jolie plans to set up town hall meetings the morning after so that she and the cast can answer questions.\n\nJudging from the experience of making the film, the reaction among ordinary Cambodians will be highly charged and emotional. In the best cases, it will also be hopeful.\n\nI tried very hard to make a film that is not just about policies or politics or war, Jolie said. It is a film at its core about the Cambodian people and family, and love, and survival. I hope that there will be a sense of pride for the Cambodian people when they see it, about what they survived, and who they are.\n\n Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, or sign up to the long read weekly email here.','2017-03-25 03:51:12'),(240,32,'2b9b30abeeaca977ad613455c9ab4de49235a536c561d3b736d85079ace7ff89','b828a8fdfd3d45249f780068a07599ff','','','Angelina Jolie Pitt ( joh-LEE; ne Voight; born June 4, 1975)[1] is an American actress, filmmaker, and humanitarian. She has received an Academy Award, two Screen Actors Guild Awards, and three Golden Globe Awards, and has been cited as Hollywood\'s highest-paid actress. Jolie made her screen debut as a child alongside her father, Jon Voight, in Lookin\' to Get Out (1982). Her film career began in earnest a decade later with the low-budget production Cyborg 2 (1993), followed by her first leading role in a major film, Hackers (1995). She starred in the critically acclaimed biographical cable films George Wallace (1997) and Gia (1998), and won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her performance in the drama Girl, Interrupted (1999).\n\nJolie\'s starring role as the video game heroine Lara Croft in Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001) established her as a leading Hollywood actress. She continued her successful action-star career with Mr. & Mrs. Smith (2005), Wanted (2008), and Salt (2010), and received critical acclaim for her performances in the dramas A Mighty Heart (2007) and Changeling (2008), which earned her a nomination for an Academy Award for Best Actress. Beginning in the 2010s, she expanded her career into directing, screenwriting, and producing, starting with the wartime dramas In the Land of Blood and Honey (2011) and Unbroken (2014). Her biggest commercial success came with the fantasy picture Maleficent (2014).\n\nIn addition to her film career, Jolie is noted for her humanitarian efforts, for which she has received a Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award and an honorary damehood of the Order of St Michael and St George (DCMG), among other honors. She promotes various causes, including conservation, education, and women\'s rights, and is most noted for her advocacy on behalf of refugees as a Special Envoy for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). As a public figure, Jolie has been cited as one of the most influential and powerful people in the American entertainment industry, as well as the world\'s most beautiful woman, by various media outlets. Her personal life is the subject of wide publicity. Divorced from actors Jonny Lee Miller and Billy Bob Thornton, she separated from her third husband, actor Brad Pitt, in September 2016. They have six children together, three of whom were adopted internationally.\n\nBorn in Los Angeles, California, Jolie is the daughter of actors Jon Voight and Marcheline Bertrand. She is the sister of actor James Haven and niece of singer-songwriter Chip Taylor.[2] Her godparents are actors Jacqueline Bisset and Maximilian Schell.[3] On her father\'s side, Jolie is of German and Slovak descent,[4][5] and on her mother\'s side, she is of primarily French Canadian, Dutch, and German ancestry.[4] Like her mother, Jolie has stated that she is part Iroquois,[6] although her only known indigenous ancestors were 17th-century Hurons.[4][7]\n\nAfter her parents\' separation in 1976, Jolie and her brother lived with their mother, who had abandoned her acting ambitions to focus on raising her children.[8] As a child, she often watched films with her mother and it was this, rather than her father\'s successful career, that inspired her interest in acting,[9] though at age five she had a bit part in Voight\'s Lookin\' to Get Out (1982).[10] When Jolie was six years old, Bertrand and her live-in partner, filmmaker Bill Day, moved the family to Palisades, New York;[11] they returned to Los Angeles five years later.[8] Jolie then decided she wanted to act and enrolled at the Lee Strasberg Theatre Institute, where she trained for two years and appeared in several stage productions.\n\nJolie first attended Beverly Hills High School, where she felt isolated among the children of some of the area\'s affluent families because her mother survived on a more modest income. She was teased by other students, who targeted her for being extremely thin and for wearing glasses and braces.[9] Her early attempts at modeling, at her mother\'s insistence, proved unsuccessful.[12][13] She then transferred to Moreno High School, an alternative school, where she became a \"punk outsider,\"[12] wearing all-black clothing, going out moshing, and experimenting with knife play with her live-in boyfriend.[9] She dropped out of her acting classes and aspired to become a funeral director,[10] taking at-home courses to study embalming.[14] At age 16, after the relationship had ended, Jolie graduated from high school and rented her own apartment, before returning to theater studies,[8][12] though in 2004 she referred to this period with the observation, \"I am still at heartand always will bejust a punk kid with tattoos.\"[15]\n\nAs a teenager, Jolie found it difficult to emotionally connect with other people, and as a result she self-harmed,[16] later commenting, \"For some reason, the ritual of having cut myself and feeling the pain, maybe feeling alive, feeling some kind of release, it was somehow therapeutic to me.\"[17] She also struggled with insomnia and an eating disorder,[14] and began experimenting with drugs; by age 20, she had used \"just about every drug possible,\" particularly heroin.[18] Jolie suffered episodes of depression and twice planned to commit suicideat age 19 and again at 22, when she attempted to hire a hitman to kill her.[10] When she was 24, she experienced a nervous breakdown and was admitted for 72 hours to UCLA Medical Center\'s psychiatric ward.[10] Two years later, after adopting her first child, Jolie found stability in her life, later stating, \"I knew once I committed to Maddox, I would never be self-destructive again.\"[19]\n\nJolie has had a lifelong dysfunctional relationship with her father, which began when Voight left the family when his daughter was less than a year old.[20] She has said that from then on their time together was sporadic and usually carried out in front of the press.[21] They reconciled when they appeared together in Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001), but their relationship again deteriorated.[8] Jolie petitioned the court to legally remove her surname \"Voight\" in favor of her middle name, which she had long used as a stage name; the name change was granted on September 12, 2002.[22] Voight then went public with their estrangement during an appearance on Access Hollywood, in which he claimed Jolie had \"serious mental problems.\"[23] At that point, her mother and brother also broke off contact with Voight.[24] They did not speak for six-and-a-half years,[25] but began rebuilding their relationship in the wake of Bertrand\'s death from ovarian cancer on January 27, 2007,[24][26] before going public with their reconciliation three years later.[24]\n\nJolie committed to acting professionally at the age of 16, but initially found it difficult to pass auditions, often being told that her demeanor was \"too dark.\"[10] She appeared in five of her brother\'s student films, made while he attended the USC School of Cinema-Television, as well as in several music videos, namely Lenny Kravitz\'s \"Stand by My Woman\" (1991), Antonello Venditti\'s \"Alta Marea\" (1991), The Lemonheads\'s \"It\'s About Time\" (1993), and Meat Loaf\'s \"Rock and Roll Dreams Come Through\" (1993). She began to learn from her father, as she noticed his method of observing people to become like them. Their relationship during this time was less strained, with Jolie realizing that they were both \"drama queens.\"[9]\n\nJolie began her professional film career in 1993, when she played her first leading role in the straight-to-video science-fiction sequel Cyborg 2, as a near-human robot designed for corporate espionage and assassination. She was so disappointed with the film that she did not audition again for a year.[10] Following a supporting role in the independent film Without Evidence (1995), she starred in her first Hollywood picture, Hackers (1995). The New York Times critic Janet Maslin wrote, \"Kate stands out. That\'s because she scowls even more sourly than [her co-stars] and is that rare female hacker who sits intently at her keyboard in a see-through top.\"[27] Hackers failed to make a profit at the box office, but developed a cult following after its video release.[28]\n\nAfter starring in the modern-day Romeo and Juliet adaptation Love Is All There Is (1996), Jolie appeared in the road movie Mojave Moon (1996), of which The Hollywood Reporter said, \"Jolie, an actress whom the camera truly adores, reveals a comic flair and the kind of blatant sexuality that makes it entirely credible that Danny Aiello\'s character would drop everything just for the chance of being with her.\"[29] In Foxfire (1996) she played a drifter who unites four teenage girls against a teacher who has sexually harassed them. Jack Mathews of the Los Angeles Times wrote of her performance, \"It took a lot of hogwash to develop this character, but Jolie, Jon Voight\'s knockout daughter, has the presence to overcome the stereotype. Though the story is narrated by Maddy, Legs is the subject and the catalyst.\"[30]\n\nIn 1997, Jolie starred with David Duchovny in the thriller Playing God, set in the Los Angeles underworld. The film was not well received by critics; Chicago Sun-Times critic Roger Ebert noted that Jolie \"finds a certain warmth in a kind of role that is usually hard and aggressive; she seems too nice to be [a mobster\'s] girlfriend, and maybe she is.\"[31] Her next work, as a frontierswoman in the CBS miniseries True Women (1997), was even less successful; writing for The Philadelphia Inquirer, Robert Strauss dismissed her as \"horrid, a fourth-rate Scarlett O\'Hara\" who relies on \"gnashed teeth and overly pouted lips.\"[32] Jolie also starred in the music video for the Rolling Stones\'s \"Anybody Seen My Baby?\" as a stripper who leaves mid-performance to wander New York City.[33]\n\nJolie\'s career prospects began to improve after she won a Golden Globe Award for her performance in TNT\'s George Wallace (1997), about the life of the segregationist Alabama Governor and presidential candidate George Wallace, played by Gary Sinise. Jolie portrayed Wallace\'s second wife, Cornelia, a performance Lee Winfrey of The Philadelphia Inquirer considered a highlight of the film.[34] George Wallace was very well received by critics and won, among other awards, the Golden Globe Award for Best Miniseries or Television Film. Jolie also received a nomination for an Emmy Award for her performance.\n\nJolie\'s first breakthrough came when she portrayed supermodel Gia Carangi in HBO\'s Gia (1998). The film chronicles the destruction of Carangi\'s life and career as a result of her addiction to heroin, and her decline and death from AIDS in the mid-1980s. Vanessa Vance of Reel.com retrospectively noted, \"Jolie gained wide recognition for her role as the titular Gia, and it\'s easy to see why. Jolie is fierce in her portrayalfilling the part with nerve, charm, and desperationand her role in this film is quite possibly the most beautiful train wreck ever filmed.\"[35] For the second consecutive year, Jolie won a Golden Globe Award and was nominated for an Emmy Award. She also won her first Screen Actors Guild Award.\n\nIn accordance with Lee Strasberg\'s method acting, Jolie preferred to stay in character in between scenes during many of her early films, and as a result had gained a reputation for being difficult to deal with. While shooting Gia, she told her husband, Jonny Lee Miller, that she would not be able to phone him: \"I\'d tell him: \'I\'m alone; I\'m dying; I\'m gay; I\'m not going to see you for weeks.\'\"[36] After Gia wrapped, she briefly gave up acting, because she felt that she had \"nothing else to give.\"[10] She separated from Miller and moved to New York, where she took night classes at New York University to study directing and screenwriting.[8] Encouraged by her Golden Globe Award win for George Wallace and the positive critical reception of Gia, Jolie resumed her career.[10]\n\nFollowing the previously filmed gangster film Hell\'s Kitchen (1998), Jolie returned to the screen in Playing by Heart (1998), part of an ensemble cast that included Sean Connery, Gillian Anderson, and Ryan Phillippe. The film received predominantly positive reviews, and Jolie was praised in particular; San Francisco Chronicle critic Peter Stack wrote, \"Jolie, working through an overwritten part, is a sensation as the desperate club crawler learning truths about what she\'s willing to gamble.\"[37] She won the Breakthrough Performance Award from the National Board of Review.\n\nIn 1999, Jolie starred in the comedy-drama Pushing Tin, alongside John Cusack, Billy Bob Thornton, and Cate Blanchett. The film met with mixed reception from critics, and Jolie\'s characterThornton\'s seductive wifewas particularly criticized; writing for The Washington Post, Desson Howe dismissed her as \"a completely ludicrous writer\'s creation of a free-spirited woman who weeps over hibiscus plants that die, wears lots of turquoise rings and gets real lonely when Russell spends entire nights away from home.\"[38] Jolie then co-starred with Denzel Washington in The Bone Collector (1999), playing a police officer who reluctantly helps Washington\'s paraplegic detective track down a serial killer. The film grossed $151.5 million worldwide,[39] but was critically unsuccessful. Terry Lawson of the Detroit Free Press concluded, \"Jolie, while always delicious to look at, is simply and woefully miscast.\"[40]\n\nJolie next took the supporting role of a sociopathic mental patient in Girl, Interrupted (1999), an adaptation of Susanna Kaysen\'s memoir of the same name. While Winona Ryder played the main character in what was hoped to be a comeback for her, the film instead marked Jolie\'s final breakthrough in Hollywood.[42] She won her third Golden Globe Award, her second Screen Actors Guild Award, and an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. For Variety, Emanuel Levy noted, \"Jolie is excellent as the flamboyant, irresponsible girl who turns out to be far more instrumental than the doctors in Susanna\'s rehabilitation.\"[43]\n\nIn 2000, Jolie appeared in her first summer blockbuster, Gone in 60 Seconds, which became her highest-grossing film to that point, earning $237.2 million internationally.[39] She had a minor role as the mechanic ex-girlfriend of a car thief played by Nicolas Cage; The Washington Post writer Stephen Hunter criticized that \"all she does in this movie is stand around, cooling down, modeling those fleshy, pulsating muscle-tubes that nest so provocatively around her teeth.\"[44] Jolie later explained that the film had been a welcome relief after her emotionally demanding role in Girl, Interrupted.\n\nAlthough highly regarded for her acting abilities, Jolie had rarely found films that appealed to a wide audience, but Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001) made her an international superstar. An adaptation of the popular Tomb Raider videogames, the film required her to learn an English accent and undergo extensive martial arts training to play the archaeologist-adventurer Lara Croft. Although the film generated mostly negative reviews, Jolie was generally praised for her physical performance; Newsday\'s John Anderson commented, \"Jolie makes the title character a virtual icon of female competence and coolth.\"[45] The film was an international hit, earning $274.7 million worldwide,[39] and launched her global reputation as a female action star.\n\nJolie next starred opposite Antonio Banderas as his mail-order bride in Original Sin (2001), the first of a string of films that were poorly received by critics and audiences alike. The New York Times critic Elvis Mitchell questioned Jolie\'s decision to follow her Oscar-winning performance with \"soft-core nonsense.\"[46] The romantic comedy Life or Something Like It (2002), though equally unsuccessful, marked an unusual choice for Jolie. Salon\'s Allen Barra considered her ambitious newscaster character a rare attempt at playing a conventional women\'s role, noting that her performance \"doesn\'t get off the ground until a scene where she goes punk and leads a group of striking bus workers in singing \'Satisfaction\'\".[47] Despite her lack of box office success, Jolie remained in demand as an actress;[15] in 2002, she established herself among Hollywood\'s highest-paid actresses, earning $10$15 million per film for the next five years.[48]\n\nJolie reprised her role as Lara Croft in Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life (2003), which was not as lucrative as the original, earning $156.5 million at the international box office.[39] She also starred in the music video for Korn\'s \"Did My Time\", which was used to promote the sequel. Her next film was Beyond Borders (2003), in which she portrayed a socialite who joins an aid worker played by Clive Owen. Though unsuccessful with audiences, the film stands as the first of several passion projects Jolie has made to bring attention to humanitarian causes.[49] Beyond Borders was a critical failure; Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times acknowledged Jolie\'s ability to \"bring electricity and believability to roles,\" but wrote that \"the limbo of a hybrid character, a badly written cardboard person in a fly-infested, blood-and-guts world, completely defeats her.\"[50]\n\nThe year 2004 saw the release of four films featuring Jolie. She first starred in the thriller Taking Lives as an FBI profiler summoned to help Montreal law enforcement hunt down a serial killer. The film received mixed reviews; The Hollywood Reporter critic Kirk Honeycutt concluded, \"Jolie plays a role that definitely feels like something she has already done, but she does add an unmistakable dash of excitement and glamour.\"[51] Jolie made a brief appearance as a fighter pilot in Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow, a science fiction adventure shot entirely with actors in front of a bluescreen, and voiced her first family film, the DreamWorks animation Shark Tale. Her supporting role as Queen Olympias in Oliver Stone\'s Alexander, about the life of Alexander the Great, was met with mixed reception, particularly concerning her Slavic accent.[47] Commercially, the film failed in North America, which Stone attributed to disapproval of the depiction of Alexander\'s bisexuality,[52] but it succeeded internationally, for a total revenue of $167.3 million.[39]\n\nIn 2005, Jolie returned to major box office success with the action-comedy Mr. & Mrs. Smith, in which she starred opposite Brad Pitt as a bored married couple who find out that they are both secret assassins. The film received mixed reviews, but was generally lauded for the chemistry between the two leads; Star Tribune critic Colin Covert noted, \"While the story feels haphazard, the movie gets by on gregarious charm, galloping energy and the stars\' thermonuclear screen chemistry.\"[53] With box office takings of $478.2 million worldwide, Mr. & Mrs. Smith was the seventh-highest grossing picture of the year and remained Jolie\'s highest-grossing live-action film for the next decade.[39][54]\n\nFollowing a supporting role as the neglected wife of a CIA officer in Robert De Niro\'s The Good Shepherd (2006), Jolie starred as Mariane Pearl in the documentary-style drama A Mighty Heart (2007). Based on Pearl\'s memoir of the same name, the film chronicles the kidnapping and murder of her husband, The Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl, in Pakistan. Although the biracial Pearl had personally chosen Jolie for the role,[55] the casting drew racial criticism and accusations of blackface.[56] The resulting performance was widely praised; Ray Bennett of The Hollywood Reporter described it as \"well-measured and moving,\" played \"with respect and a firm grasp on a difficult accent.\"[57] She received nominations for a Golden Globe Award and a Screen Actors Guild Award. Jolie also played a shape-shifting seductress, Grendel\'s mother, in the epic Beowulf (2007), created through motion capture. The film was critically and commercially well received, taking in revenues of $196.4 million worldwide.[39]\n\nBy 2008, Jolie was considered the highest-paid actress in Hollywood, earning $15$20 million per film.[58][59] While other actresses had been forced to take salary cuts in recent years, Jolie\'s perceived box office appeal allowed her to command as much as $20 million plus a percentage.[60] She starred alongside James McAvoy and Morgan Freeman in the action film Wanted (2008), which proved an international success, earning $341.4 million worldwide.[39] The film received predominantly favorable reviews; writing for The New York Times, Manohla Dargis noted that Jolie was \"perfectly cast as a super-scary, seemingly amoral assassin,\" adding that \"she cuts the kind of disciplinarian figure who can bring boys of all ages to their knees or at least into their theater seats.\"[61]\n\nJolie next took the lead role in Clint Eastwood\'s drama Changeling (2008).[62] Based in part on the Wineville Chicken Coop Murders, the film centers on Christine Collins, who is reunited with her kidnapped son in 1928 Los Angeles, only to realize the boy is an imposter. Chicago Tribune critic Michael Phillips noted, \"Jolie really shines in the calm before the storm, the scenes when one patronizing male authority figure after another belittles her at their peril.\"[63] She received nominations for a Golden Globe Award, a Screen Actors Guild Award, a BAFTA Award, and an Academy Award for Best Actress. Jolie also voiced the DreamWorks animation Kung Fu Panda (2008), the first work in a major family franchise, later reprising her voice role in the sequels Kung Fu Panda 2 (2011) and Kung Fu Panda 3 (2016).\n\nAfter her mother\'s death in 2007, Jolie began appearing in fewer films, later explaining that her motivation to be an actress had stemmed from her mother\'s acting ambitions.[64] Her first film in two years was the thriller Salt (2010), in which she starred as a CIA agent who goes on the run after she is accused of being a KGB sleeper agent. Originally written as a male character with Tom Cruise attached to star, agent Salt underwent a gender change after a Columbia Pictures executive suggested Jolie for the role. With revenues of $293.5 million, Salt became an international success.[39] The film received generally positive reviews, with Jolie\'s performance in particular earning praise; Empire critic William Thomas remarked, \"When it comes to selling incredible, crazy, death-defying antics, Jolie has few peers in the action business.\"[65]\n\nJolie starred opposite Johnny Depp in the thriller The Tourist (2010). The film was a critical failure, though Roger Ebert defended Jolie\'s performance, stating that she \"does her darndest\" and \"plays her femme fatale with flat-out, drop-dead sexuality.\"[66] Despite the poor critical reception and a slow start at the North American box office, the film went on to gross a respectable $278.3 million worldwide,[39] cementing Jolie\'s appeal to international audiences.[67] She received a Golden Globe Award nomination for her performance, which gave rise to speculation that it had been given merely to ensure her high-profile presence at the awards ceremony.[68][69]\n\nAfter directing the documentary A Place in Time (2007), which was distributed through the National Education Association,[70] Jolie made her feature directorial debut with In the Land of Blood and Honey (2011), a love story between a Serb soldier and a Bosniak prisoner, set during the 199295 Bosnian War. She conceived the film to rekindle attention for the survivors, after twice visiting Bosnia and Herzegovina in her role as a UNHCR Goodwill Ambassador.[71] To ensure authenticity, she cast only actors from the former Yugoslaviaincluding stars Goran Kosti and Zana Marjanoviand incorporated their wartime experiences into her screenplay.[72] Upon release, the film received mixed reviews; Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter wrote, \"Jolie deserves significant credit for creating such a powerfully oppressive atmosphere and staging the ghastly events so credibly, even if it is these very strengths that will make people not want to watch what\'s onscreen.\"[73] The film was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Language Film, and Jolie was named an honorary citizen of Sarajevo for raising awareness of the war.[74]\n\nAfter a three-and-a-half-year absence from the screen, Jolie starred in Maleficent (2014), a live-action re-imagining of Disney\'s 1959 animation Sleeping Beauty. Critical reception was mixed, but Jolie\'s performance in the titular role was singled out for praise;[75] The Hollywood Reporter critic Sherri Linden found her to be the \"heart and soul\" of the film, adding that she \"doesn\'t chew the estimable scenery in Maleficentshe infuses it, wielding a magnetic and effortless power.\"[76] In its opening weekend, Maleficent earned nearly $70 million at the North American box office and over $100 million in other markets, marking Jolie\'s appeal to audiences of all demographics in both action and fantasy films, genres usually dominated by male actors.[77] The film went on to gross $757.8 million worldwide, becoming the fourth-highest-grossing film of the year and Jolie\'s highest-grossing film ever.[39][78]\n\nJolie next completed her second directorial venture, Unbroken (2014), about World War II hero Louis Zamperini (19172014), a former Olympic track star who survived a plane crash over sea and spent two years in a Japanese prisoner-of-war camp. Based on Laura Hillenbrand\'s biography of the same name, the film was scripted by the Coen brothers and starred Jack O\'Connell.[79] After a positive early reception, Unbroken was considered a likely Best Picture and Best Director contender,[79][80] but it ultimately received mixed reviews and little award recognition,[81] though it was named one of the best films of the year by the National Board of Review and the American Film Institute.[82][83] In a typical review, Variety\'s Justin Chang noted the film\'s \"impeccable craftsmanship and sober restraint\", but deemed it \"an extraordinary story told in dutiful, unexceptional terms.\"[81][84] Financially, Unbroken far outperformed industry expectations in its opening weekend,[85] eventually earning over $163 million worldwide.[86]\n\nJolie\'s next directorial effort was the marital drama By the Sea (2015), in which she starred opposite her husband, Brad Pitt, marking their first collaboration since 2005\'s Mr. & Mrs. Smith. Based on her screenplay, the film was a deeply personal project for Jolie, who drew inspiration from her own mother\'s life. Critics, however, dismissed it as a \"vanity project,\" as part of an overall poor reception.[87][88] Writing for The Washington Post, Stephanie Merry noted its dearth of genuine emotion, stating, \"By the Sea is dazzlingly gorgeous, as are its stars. But peeling back layer upon layer of exquisite ennui reveals nothing but emptiness, sprinkled with stilted sentiments.\"[89] Despite starring two of Hollywood\'s leading actors, the film received only a limited release.[87]\n\nAs Jolie preferred to dedicate herself to her humanitarian work, her cinematic output remained infrequent. First They Killed My Father (2017), a drama set during Cambodia\'s Khmer Rouge era, again enabled her to combine both interests. In addition to directing the film, she co-wrote the screenplay with her longtime friend Loung Ung, whose memoirs about the regime\'s child labor camps served as its source material. Intended primarily for a Cambodian audience, the film was produced directly for Netflix, which allowed for the use of an exclusively Khmer cast and script.[90] Jolie is next contracted to reprise the role of Maleficent in Disney\'s sequel.[91]\n\nJolie first witnessed the effects of a humanitarian crisis while filming Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001) in war-torn Cambodia, an experience she later credited with having brought her a greater understanding of the world.[93] Upon her return home, she contacted the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) for information on international trouble spots.[92] To learn more about the conditions in these areas, she began visiting refugee camps around the world. In February 2001, she went on her first field visit, an 18-day mission to Sierra Leone and Tanzania; she later expressed her shock at what she had witnessed.[92]\n\nIn the following months, Jolie returned to Cambodia for two weeks and met with Afghan refugees in Pakistan, where she donated $1 million in response to an international UNHCR emergency appeal,[94][95] the largest donation UNHCR had ever received from a private individual.[96] She covered all costs related to her missions and shared the same rudimentary working and living conditions as UNHCR field staff on all of her visits.[92] Jolie was named a UNHCR Goodwill Ambassador at UNHCR headquarters in Geneva on August 27, 2001.[97]\n\nOver the next decade, she went on more than 40 field missions, meeting with refugees and internally displaced persons in over 30 countries.[98] In 2002, when asked what she hoped to accomplish, she stated, \"Awareness of the plight of these people. I think they should be commended for what they have survived, not looked down upon.\"[94] To that end, her 2001-02 field visits were chronicled in her book Notes from My Travels, which was published in October 2003 in conjunction with the release of her humanitarian drama Beyond Borders.\n\nJolie aimed to visit what she termed \"forgotten emergencies,\" crises that media attention had shifted away from.[99] She became noted for travelling to war zones,[100] such as Sudan\'s Darfur region during the Darfur conflict,[101] the Syrian-Iraqi border during the Second Gulf War,[102] where she met privately with U.S. troops and other multi-national forces,[103] and the Afghan capital Kabul during the war in Afghanistan, where three aid workers were murdered in the midst of her first visit.[100] To aid her travels, she began taking flying lessons in 2004 with the aim of ferrying aid workers and food supplies around the world;[15][104] she now holds a private pilot license with instrument rating and owns a Cirrus SR22 and Cessna 208 Caravan single-engine aircraft.[105][106][107]\n\nOn April 17, 2012, after more than a decade of service as a UNHCR Goodwill Ambassador, Jolie was promoted to the rank of Special Envoy to High Commissioner Antnio Guterres, the first to take on such a position within the organization. In her expanded role, she was given authority to represent Guterres and UNHCR at the diplomatic level, with a focus on major refugee crises.[108] In the months following her promotion, she made her first visit as Special Envoyher third over allto Ecuador, where she met with Colombian refugees,[109] and she accompanied Guterres on a week-long tour of Jordan, Lebanon, Turkey, and Iraq, to assess the situation of refugees from neighboring Syria.[110] Since then, Jolie has gone on over a dozen field missions around the world to meet with refugees and undertake advocacy on their behalf.[98][111]\n\nIn an effort to connect her Cambodian-born son with his heritage, Jolie purchased a house in his country of birth in 2003. The traditional home sat on 39 hectares in the northwestern province Battambang, adjacent to Samlout national park in the Cardamom mountains, which had become infiltrated with poachers who threatened endangered species. She purchased the park\'s 60,000 hectares and turned the area into a wildlife reserve named for her son, the Maddox Jolie Project.[112] In recognition of her conservation efforts, King Norodom Sihamoni awarded her Cambodian citizenship on July 31, 2005.[113]\n\nIn November 2006, Jolie expanded the scope of the projectrenamed the Maddox Jolie-Pitt Foundation (MJP)to create Asia\'s first Millennium Village, in accordance with UN development goals.[114] She was inspired by a meeting with the founder of Millennium Promise, noted economist Jeffrey Sachs, at the World Economic Forum in Davos,[112] where she was an invited speaker in 2005 and 2006. Together they filmed a 2005 MTV special, The Diary of Angelina Jolie & Dr. Jeffrey Sachs in Africa, which followed them on a trip to a Millennium Village in western Kenya. By mid-2007, some 6,000 villagers and 72 employeessome of them former poachers employed as rangerslived and worked at MJP, in ten villages previously isolated from one another. The compound includes schools, roads, and a soy milk factory, all funded by Jolie. Her home functions as the MJP field headquarters.[112]\n\nAfter filming Beyond Borders (2003) in Namibia, Jolie became patron of the Harnas Wildlife Foundation, a wildlife orphanage and medical center in the Kalahari desert. She first visited the Harnas farm during production of the film, which features vultures rescued by the foundation.[115] In December 2010, Jolie and her partner, Brad Pitt, established the Shiloh Jolie-Pitt Foundation to support conservation work by the Naankuse Wildlife Sanctuary, a nature reserve also located in the Kalahari.[116] In name of their Namibian-born daughter, they have funded large-animal conservation projects as well as a free health clinic, housing, and a school for the San Bushmen community at Naankuse.[117][118][119] Jolie and Pitt support other causes through the Jolie-Pitt Foundation, established in September 2006.[120]\n\nJolie has pushed for legislation to aid child immigrants and other vulnerable children in both the U.S. and developing nations, including the \"Unaccompanied Alien Child Protection Act of 2005.\"[97][121] She began lobbying humanitarian interests in the U.S. capital from 2003 onwards, explaining, \"As much as I would love to never have to visit Washington, that\'s the way to move the ball.\"[97] Since October 2008, she has co-chaired Kids in Need of Defense (KIND), a network of leading U.S. law firms that provide free legal aid to unaccompanied minors in immigration proceedings across the U.S.[122] Founded in a collaboration between Jolie and the Microsoft Corporation, by 2013, KIND had become the principal provider of pro bono lawyers for immigrant children.[123] Jolie had previously, from 2005 to 2007, funded the launch of a similar initiative, the U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants\' National Center for Refugee and Immigrant Children.[121][124]\n\nJolie has also advocated for children\'s education. Since its founding at the Clinton Global Initiative\'s annual meeting in September 2007, she has co-chaired the Education Partnership for Children of Conflict, which provides policy and funding to education programs for children in conflict-affected regions.[125] In its first year, the partnership supported education projects for Iraqi refugee children, youth affected by the Darfur conflict, and girls in rural Afghanistan, among other affected groups.[125] The partnership has worked closely with the Council on Foreign Relations\' Center for Universal Educationfounded by the partnership\'s co-chair, noted economist Gene Sperlingto establish education policies, which resulted in recommendations made to UN agencies, G8 development agencies, and the World Bank.[126] Since April 2013, all proceeds from Jolie\'s high-end jewelry collection, Style of Jolie, have benefited the partnership\'s work.[127]\n\nJolie has funded a school and boarding facility for girls at Kakuma refugee camp in northwestern Kenya,[128] which opened in 2005,[129] and two primary schools for girls in the returnee settlements Tangi and Qalai Gudar in eastern Afghanistan, which opened in March 2010 and November 2012 respectively.[130][131] In addition to the facilities at the Millennium Village she established in Cambodia, Jolie had built at least ten other schools in the country by 2005.[132] In February 2006, she opened the Maddox Chivan Children\'s Center, a medical and educational facility for children affected by HIV, in the Cambodian capital Phnom Penh.[114] In Sebeta, Ethiopia, the birthplace of her eldest daughter, she funds a sister facility, the Zahara Children\'s Center, which is expected to open in 2015 and will treat and educate children suffering from HIV or tuberculosis. Both centers are run by the Global Health Committee.[133]\n\nJolie has expressed her support for Malala Yousafzai, a teenage education activist in Pakistan known for being shot by members of the Taliban after blogging about life under Taliban rule for BBC Urdu, and promoting education for Pakistani girls.[134] Following the shooting of Yousafzai on 9 October 2012, Jolie wrote an article for The Daily Beast titled \"We All Are Malala,\" in which she documented her reaction to the teen\'s shooting, voiced her support for girls\' education in Pakistan, and expressed her support for Yousafzai.[135][136] The following year, Jolie gave a speech at the 2013 Women in the World Summit, in which she expressed her support for Yousafzai, and announced the start of the Malala Fund, a grant system aimed at supporting schoolgirls in Pakistan.[137][138][139] Jolie has personally contributed over $200,000 to the Malala fund.[140] Jolie also honored Yousafzai by opening up an all-girls school in Pakistan.[141]\n\nAfter Jolie joined the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) in June 2007,[142] she hosted a symposium on international law and justice at CFR headquarters and funded several CFR special reports, including \"Intervention to Stop Genocide and Mass Atrocities.\"[111][122] In January 2011, she established the Jolie Legal Fellowship,[143] a network of lawyers and attorneys who are sponsored to advocate the development of human rights in their countries.[144] Its member attorneys, called Jolie Legal Fellows, have facilitated child protection efforts in Haiti in the wake of the 2010 earthquake and promoted the development of an inclusive democratic process in Libya following the 2011 revolution.[143][144][145]\n\nJolie has fronted a campaign against sexual violence in military conflict zones by the UK government, which made the issue a priority of its 2013 G8 presidency. In May 2012, she launched the Preventing Sexual Violence Initiative (PSVI) with Foreign Secretary William Hague,[146] who was inspired to campaign on the issue by her Bosnian war drama In the Land of Blood and Honey (2011).[147] PSVI was established to complement wider UK government work by raising awareness and promoting international co-operation.[146] Jolie spoke on the subject at the G8 foreign ministers meeting,[148] where the attending nations adopted a historic declaration,[146] and before the UN security council, which responded by adopting its broadest resolution on the issue to date.[149] In June 2014, she co-chaired the four-day Global Summit to End Sexual Violence in Conflict, the largest-ever meeting on the subject,[150] which resulted in a protocol endorsed by 151 nations.[151]\n\nThrough her work on the PSVI, Jolie met foreign policy experts Chloe Dalton and Arminka Helic, who served as special advisers to Hague. Their collaboration resulted in the 2015 founding of Jolie Pitt Dalton Helic, a partnership dedicated to women\'s rights and international justice, among other causes.[152] In May 2016, Jolie was appointed a visiting professor at the London School of Economics to contribute to a postgraduate degree program at the university\'s Centre on Women, Peace and Security,[153] which she had launched with Hague the previous year.[151]\n\nJolie has received wide recognition for her humanitarian work. In August 2002, she received the inaugural Humanitarian Award from the Church World Service\'s Immigration and Refugee Program,[154] and in October 2003, she was the first recipient of the Citizen of the World Award by the United Nations Correspondents Association.[155] She was awarded the Global Humanitarian Award by the UNA-USA in October 2005,[156] and she received the Freedom Award from the International Rescue Committee in November 2007.[157] In October 2011, UN High Commissioner for Refugees Antnio Guterres presented Jolie with a gold pin reserved for the most long-serving staff, in recognition of her decade as a UNHCR Goodwill Ambassador.[158]\n\nIn November 2013, Jolie received the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award, an honorary Academy Award, from the Board of Governors of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.[159][160] In June 2014, she was appointed an Honorary Dame Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George (DCMG) for her services to the UK\'s foreign policy and campaigning to end sexual violence in war zones.[161][162] Queen Elizabeth II presented Jolie with the insignia of her honorary damehood during a private ceremony the following October.[163]\n\nJolie had a serious boyfriend for two years from the age of 14. Her mother allowed them to live together in her home, of which Jolie later said, \"I was either going to be reckless on the streets with my boyfriend or he was going to be with me in my bedroom with my mom in the next room. She made the choice, and because of it, I continued to go to school every morning and explored my first relationship in a safe way.\"[164] She has compared the relationship to a marriage in its emotional intensity, and said that the breakup compelled her to dedicate herself to her acting career at the age of 16.[165]\n\nDuring filming of Hackers (1995), Jolie had a romance with British actor Jonny Lee Miller, her first lover since the relationship in her early teens.[10] They were not in touch for many months after production ended, but eventually reconnected and married soon after in March 1996. She attended her wedding in black rubber pants and a white T-shirt, upon which she had written the groom\'s name in her blood.[166] Though the relationship ended for good the following year, Jolie remained on good terms with Miller, whom she called \"a solid man and a solid friend.\"[14] Their divorce, initiated by Jolie in February 1999, was finalized shortly before she remarried the next year.[167][168]\n\nPrior to her marriage to Miller, Jolie began a relationship with model-actress Jenny Shimizu on the set of Foxfire (1996). She later said, \"I would probably have married Jenny if I hadn\'t married my husband. I fell in love with her the first second I saw her.\"[169] According to Shimizu, their relationship lasted several years and continued even while Jolie was romantically involved with other people.[170] In 2003, when asked if she was bisexual, Jolie responded, \"Of course. If I fell in love with a woman tomorrow, would I feel that it\'s okay to want to kiss and touch her? If I fell in love with her? Absolutely! Yes!\"[171]\n\nAfter a two-month courtship, Jolie married actor Billy Bob Thornton on May 5, 2000, in Las Vegas. They had met on the set of Pushing Tin (1999), but did not pursue a relationship at that time as Thornton was engaged to actress Laura Dern, while Jolie was reportedly dating actor Timothy Hutton, her co-star in Playing God (1997).[168] As a result of their frequent public declarations of passion and gestures of lovemost famously wearing one another\'s blood in vials around their neckstheir marriage became a favorite topic of the entertainment media.[172] Jolie and Thornton announced the adoption of a child from Cambodia in March 2002, but abruptly separated three months later.[173] Their divorce was finalized on May 27, 2003. When asked about the sudden dissolution of their marriage, Jolie stated, \"It took me by surprise, too, because overnight, we totally changed. I think one day we had just nothing in common. And it\'s scary but... I think it can happen when you get involved and you don\'t know yourself yet.\"[15]\n\nJolie was involved in a well-publicized Hollywood scandal when she was accused of having caused the 2005 divorce of actors Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston. She had fallen in love with Pitt during filming of Mr. & Mrs. Smith (2005), but dismissed allegations of an affair,[174] saying, \"To be intimate with a married man, when my own father cheated on my mother, is not something I could forgive. I could not look at myself in the morning if I did that. I wouldn\'t be attracted to a man who would cheat on his wife.\"[171] Jolie and Pitt did not publicly comment on the nature of their relationship until January 2006, when she confirmed that she was pregnant with his child.[175]\n\nDuring their twelve-year relationship, \"Brangelina\"a portmanteau coined by the entertainment mediawere the subject of worldwide media coverage.[176] After the initial scandal subsided, they became one of Hollywood\'s most glamorous couples.[177] Their family grew to include six children, three of whom were adopted, before they announced their engagement in April 2012.[178] Jolie and Pitt married on August 23, 2014, at their estate Chteau Miraval in Correns, France.[179] She subsequently took on the name \"Jolie Pitt\".[180] After two years of marriage, the couple separated in September 2016; in her divorce filing, Jolie requested physical custody of their children.[181]\n\nOn March 10, 2002, Jolie adopted her first child,[182] seven-month-old Maddox Chivan,[22] from an orphanage in Battambang, Cambodia.[183] He was born as Rath Vibol on August 5, 2001,[184] in a local village.[14] After twice visiting Cambodia, while filming Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001) and on a UNHCR field mission, Jolie returned in November 2001 with her husband, Billy Bob Thornton, where they met Maddox and subsequently applied to adopt him.[185] The adoption process was halted the following month when the U.S. government banned adoptions from Cambodia amid allegations of child trafficking.[185] Although Jolie\'s adoption facilitator was later convicted of visa fraud and money laundering, her adoption of Maddox was deemed lawful.[186] Once the process was finalized, she took custody of him in Namibia, where she was filming Beyond Borders (2003).[185] Jolie and Thornton announced the adoption together, but she adopted Maddox alone,[173][187] and raised him as a single parent following their separation three months later.[173][188]\n\nJolie adopted a daughter, six-month-old Zahara Marley, from an orphanage in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, on July 6, 2005.[189][190] Zahara was born as Yemsrach on January 8, 2005, in Awasa.[191][192] Jolie initially believed Zahara to be an AIDS orphan,[193] based on official testimony from her grandmother,[194] but her birth mother later came forward in the media. She explained that she had abandoned her family when Zahara became sick, and said she thought Zahara was \"very fortunate\" to have been adopted by Jolie.[191] Jolie was accompanied by her partner, Brad Pitt, when she traveled to Ethiopia to take custody of Zahara.[189] She later indicated that they had together made the decision to adopt from Ethiopia,[195] having first visited the country earlier that year.[196] After Pitt announced his intention to adopt her children,[197] she filed a petition to legally change their surname from Jolie to Jolie-Pitt, which was granted on January 19, 2006.[192] Pitt adopted Maddox and Zahara soon after.[198]\n\nIn an attempt to avoid the unprecedented media frenzy surrounding their relationship, Jolie and Pitt traveled to Namibia for the birth of their first biological child.[176] On May 27, 2006, she gave birth to a daughter, Shiloh Nouvel, in Swakopmund.[199] They sold the first pictures of Shiloh through the distributor Getty Images with the aim of benefiting charity, rather than allowing paparazzi to make these valuable photographs.[198] People and Hello! purchased the North American and British rights to the images for $4.1 and $3.5 million respectively, a record in celebrity photojournalism at that time,[200] with all proceeds donated to UNICEF.[201]\n\nOn March 15, 2007, Jolie adopted a son, three-year-old Pax Thien, from an orphanage in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.[202] He was born as Pham Quang Sang on November 29, 2003, in HCMC, where he was abandoned by his biological mother soon after birth.[203] After visiting the orphanage with Pitt in November 2006, Jolie applied for adoption as a single parent, because Vietnam\'s adoption regulations do not allow unmarried couples to co-adopt.[202] After their return to the U.S., she petitioned the court to change her son\'s surname from Jolie to Jolie-Pitt, which was approved on May 31.[204] Pitt subsequently adopted Pax on February 21, 2008.[205]\n\nAt the Cannes Film Festival in May 2008, Jolie confirmed that she was expecting twins. For the two weeks she spent in a seaside hospital in Nice, France, reporters and photographers camped outside on the promenade.[206] She gave birth to a son, Knox Lon, and a daughter, Vivienne Marcheline, on July 12, 2008. The first pictures of Knox and Vivienne were jointly sold to People and Hello! for a reported $14 millionthe most expensive celebrity photographs ever taken. All proceeds were donated to the Jolie-Pitt Foundation.[207]\n\nOn February 16, 2013, at age 37, Jolie underwent a preventive double mastectomy after learning she had an 87% risk of developing breast cancer due to a defective BRCA1 gene.[208] Her maternal family history warranted genetic testing for BRCA mutations: her mother, actress Marcheline Bertrand, had breast cancer and died from ovarian cancer, while her grandmother died from ovarian cancer.[209][210] Her aunt, who had the same BRCA1 defect, died from breast cancer three months after Jolie\'s operation.[211] Following the mastectomy, which lowered her chances of developing breast cancer to under 5 percent, Jolie had reconstructive surgery involving implants and allografts.[209] Two years later, in March 2015, after annual test results indicated possible signs of early ovarian cancer, she underwent a preventive oophorectomy, as she had a 50% risk of developing ovarian cancer due to the same genetic anomaly. Despite hormone replacement therapy, the surgery brought on premature menopause.[210]\n\nAfter completing each operation, Jolie discussed her mastectomy and oophorectomy in op-eds published by The New York Times, with the aim of helping other women make informed health choices. She detailed her diagnosis, surgeries, and personal experiences, and described her decision to undergo preventive surgery as a proactive measure for the sake of her six children.[208][210][212] Jolie further wrote, \"On a personal note, I do not feel any less of a woman. I feel empowered that I made a strong choice that in no way diminishes my femininity.\"[208]\n\nJolie\'s announcement of her mastectomy attracted widespread publicity and discussion on BRCA mutations and genetic testing.[213] Her decision was met with praise from various public figures,[214] while health campaigners welcomed her raising awareness of the options available to at-risk women.[215] Dubbed \"The Angelina Effect\" by a Time cover story,[216] Jolie\'s influence led to a \"global and long-lasting\" increase in BRCA gene testing:[217] the number of referrals tripled in Australia and doubled in the UK, parts of Canada, and India,[217][218][219] as well as significantly increased in other European countries and the U.S.[220][221][222] Researchers in Canada and the UK found that despite the large increase, the percentage of mutation carriers remained the same, meaning Jolie\'s message had reached those most at risk.[217] In her first op-ed, Jolie had advocated wider accessibility of BRCA gene testing and acknowledged the high costs,[223] which were greatly reduced after the U.S. Supreme Court, in a June 2013 ruling, invalidated BRCA gene patents held by Myriad Genetics.[224][225]\n\nAs the daughter of actor Jon Voight, Jolie appeared in the media from an early age.[21] After embarking on her own career, she earned a reputation as a \"wild child,\" which contributed to her early success in the late 1990s and early 2000s.[226] Celebrity profiles routinely covered her fascination with blood and knives, experiences with drugs, and her sex life, particularly her bisexuality and interest in sadomasochism.[226][227] In 2000, when asked about her outspokenness, she stated, \"I say things that other people might go through. That\'s what artists should dothrow things out there and not be perfect and not have answers for anything and see if people understand.\"[227] Another contributing factor of her controversial image were tabloid rumors of incest that started when Jolie, upon winning her Oscar, kissed her brother on the lips and said, \"I\'m so in love with my brother right now.\"[10] She dismissed the rumors, saying, \"It was disappointing that something so beautiful and pure could be turned into a circus,\"[228] and explained that, as children of divorce, she and James relied on one another for emotional support.[10]\n\nJolie\'s reputation began to change positively after she, at age 26, became a Goodwill Ambassador for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, later commenting, \"In my early 20s I was fighting with myself. Now I take that punk in me to Washington, and I fight for something important.\"[97] Owing to her extensive activism, her Q Scorethe industry\'s measure of celebrities\' likabilitynearly doubled to 25 between 2000 and 2006.[97] Her recognizability grew accordingly; by 2006, she was familiar to 81% of Americans, compared to 31% in 2000.[97] She became noted for her ability to positively influence her public image through the media, without employing a publicist or an agent.[229] Her Q Score remained above average even when, in 2005, she was accused of ending Brad Pitt\'s marriage to Jennifer Aniston,[230] at which point her public persona became an unlikely combination of alleged homewrecker, mother, sex symbol, and humanitarian.[231] A decade later, Jolie was found to be the most admired woman in the world in global surveys conducted by YouGov in 2015 and 2016.[232][233]\n\nJolie\'s general influence and wealth are extensively documented. In a 2006 global industry survey by ACNielsen in 42 international markets, Jolie, together with Pitt, was found to be the favorite celebrity endorser for brands and products worldwide.[234] She was the face of St. John and Shiseido from 2006 to 2008, and in 2011 had an endorsement deal with Louis Vuitton reportedly worth $10 milliona record for a single advertising campaign.[235] Jolie was among the Time 100, a list of the most influential people in the world as published by Time, in 2006 and 2008.[236][237] She was named the world\'s most powerful celebrity in Forbes\'s Celebrity 100 issue in 2009, and, though ranked lower overall, was listed as the most powerful actress from 2006 to 2008 and 2011 to 2013.[238][239] Forbes additionally cited her as Hollywood\'s highest-paid actress in 2009, 2011, and 2013, with estimated annual earnings of $27 million, $30 million, and $33 million respectively.[67][240][241]\n\nJolie\'s public image is strongly tied to her perceived beauty and sex appeal.[242] Many media outlets, including Vogue, People, and Vanity Fair, have cited her as the world\'s most beautiful woman, while others such as Esquire, FHM, and Empire have named her the sexiest woman alive; both titles have often been based on public polls in which Jolie places far ahead of other celebrity women.[243] Her most recognizable physical features are her many tattoos, eyes, and in particular her full lips, which The New York Times considered as defining a feature as Kirk Douglas\'s chin or Bette Davis\'s eyes.[244] Among her estimated 20 tattoos are the Latin proverb quod me nutrit me destruit (\"what nourishes me destroys me\"), the Tennessee Williams quote \"A prayer for the wild at heart, kept in cages\", four Buddhist Sanskrit prayers of protection,[245][246] a twelve-inch tiger, and geographical coordinates indicating the birthplaces of her husband and children.[247] Over time, she has covered or lasered several of her tattoos, including \"Billy Bob\", the name of her second husband.[245]\n\nProfessionally, Jolie\'s status as a sex symbol has been considered both an asset and a hindrance. Some of her most commercially successful films, including Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001) and Beowulf (2007), overtly relied at least in part on her sex appeal,[248][249] with Empire stating that her \"pneumatic figure,\" \"feline eyes,\" and \"bee-stung lips\" have greatly contributed to her appeal to cinema audiences.[250] Conversely, Salon writer Allen Barra agreed with critics who suggested that Jolie\'s \"dark and intense sexuality\" has limited her in the types of roles she can be cast in, rendering her unconvincing in many conventional women\'s roles,[47] while Clint Eastwood, who directed her Oscar-nominated performance in Changeling (2008), opined that having \"the most beautiful face on the planet\" sometimes harmed her dramatic credibility with audiences.[251]\n\nBeyond her career, Jolie\'s appearance has been credited with influencing popular culture at large. In 2002, AfterEllen founder Sarah Warn observed that many women of all sexual orientations had publicly expressed their attraction to Jolie, which she considered a new development in American culture, adding that \"there are many beautiful women in Hollywood, and few generate the same kind of overwhelming interest across genders and sexual orientations that she does.\"[252] Jolie\'s physical attributes became highly sought-after among western women seeking cosmetic surgery; by 2007, she was considered \"the gold standard of beauty,\"[253] with her full lips remaining the most imitated celebrity feature well into the 2010s.[254][255] After a 2011 repeat survey by Allure found that Jolie most represented the American beauty ideal, compared to model Christie Brinkley in 1991, writer Elizabeth Angell credited society with having \"branched out beyond the Barbie-doll ideal and embraced something quite different.\"[256][257] In 2013, Jeffrey Kluger of Time agreed that Jolie has for many years symbolized the feminine ideal, and opined that her frank discussion of her double mastectomy redefined beauty.[216]','2017-03-25 03:51:12'),(241,32,'2b9b30abeeaca977ad613455c9ab4de49235a536c561d3b736d85079ace7ff89','628d550847804514ba26f47c4c212461','','','- The Hollywood superstars are calling quits on their marriage after just two years - Ange calls in lawyer who represented Johnny Depp in Amber Heard divorce - Problems started when pairmade film about unhappy married couple - Angelina wants full custody of couple\'s six children -Pitt releases statement saying he is \'very saddened\' and wants the best for the kids\n\nClick to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window)\n\nClick to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)\n\nClick to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)\n\nANGELINA Jolie has filed for divorce fromBrad Pitt amid shock claims he cheated on her with movie co-star Marion Cotillard.\n\nThe Hollywood actress wants overall physical custody of their six children  not joint custody with Brad after citing irreconcilable differences in legal papers.\n\nThe New York Post have claimed the 41-year-old actress hireda private investigator to spy on him on the set of his latest film  wherethey claimshe learned he was cheating.\n\nOne source told Page Six: \"She hired a private eye because she felt that he was fooling around with her (Cotillard) on the set, and it turns out, he was.\n\n\"And that was the final straw.\"\n\nThe rumours come as atrailer for Pitt\'s upcoming movie with Cotillard shows the pair passionately kissing, with the movie reportedly featuring a number of steamy sex scenes.\n\nButTMZhas said the marriage breakdown was not over an affair at all, instead making the incredible accusation thatAngelina had become \'\"fed up\" with Brad\'s consumption of weed and possibly alcohol, and mixed with what she believes is \"an anger problem\" felt it became dangerous for the children.\n\nShe also reportedly became upset over his parenting methods, with the couple differing in their approach to bringing up their six kids.\n\nBut a source told TMZ that the claims around Pitt\'s parentingwere a \"malicious lie\", saying \"he\'s a loving and devoted father who has never and would never put his children in any dangerous situation.\"\n\nThe source also said that the father of six wanted to remain a \"present father\" for the brood.\n\nBrad Pitt has released a statement to PEOPLE, since the news broke, saying: \"I am very saddened by this, but what matters now is the well being of our kids.\n\n\"I kindly ask the press to give them the space they deserve during this challenging time.\"\n\nHe also spoke out saying that when a couple faces a difficult trial, it could either make or break them.\n\nAngelina Jolie\'s manager Geyer Kosinski said in a statement: \"Angelina will always do what\'s in the best interest to protect her children.\"\n\nAngelina\'s entertainment attorney Robert Offer released a statement,saying the star hadmade the decision \"for the health of the family.\"\n\nMarion Cotillardis sincesaid to be \"absolutely devastated\"over claims she is involved in the split.\n\nA source said that the40-year-old actress was \"blissfully happy\" withfellow actor Guillame Canet.\n\nThe source said Cotillard, whohad son Marcel about five years ago, \"enjoys her family time and wants to enjoy more of it.

She has received an Academy Award, two Screen Actors Guild Awards, and three Golden Globe Awards, and has been cited as Hollywood\'s highest-paid actress. Jolie made her screen debut as a child alongside her father, Jon Voight, in Lookin\' to Get Out (1982). Her film career began in earnest a decade later with the low-budget production Cyborg 2 (1993), followed by her first leading role in a major film, Hackers (1995). She starred in the critically acclaimed biographical television films George Wallace (1997) and Gia (1998), and won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her performance in the drama Girl, Interrupted (1999).\n\nJolie\'s starring role as the video game heroine Lara Croft in Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001) established her as a leading Hollywood actress. She continued her successful action-star career with Mr. & Mrs. Smith (2005), Wanted (2008), and Salt (2010), and received critical acclaim for her performances in the dramas A Mighty Heart (2007) and Changeling (2008), which earned her a nomination for an Academy Award for Best Actress. Beginning in the 2010s, she expanded her career by directing and producing the wartime dramas In the Land of Blood and Honey (2011) and Unbroken (2014). Her biggest commercial success came with the Disney fantasy Maleficent (2014).\n\nIn addition to her film career, Jolie is noted for her humanitarian efforts, for which she has received a Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award and an honorary damehood of the Order of St Michael and St George (DCMG), among other honors. She promotes various causes, including conservation, education, and women\'s rights, and is most noted for her advocacy on behalf of refugees as a Special Envoy for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). As a public figure, Jolie has been cited as one of the most influential and powerful people in the American entertainment industry, as well as the world\'s most beautiful woman, by various media outlets. Her personal life is the subject of wide publicity. Divorced from actors Jonny Lee Miller and Billy Bob Thornton, she is now married to actor Brad Pitt. They have six children together, three of whom were adopted internationally.\n\nBorn in Los Angeles, California, Jolie is the daughter of actors Jon Voight and Marcheline Bertrand. She is the sister of actor James Haven and niece of singer-songwriter Chip Taylor. Her godparents are actors Jacqueline Bisset and Maximilian Schell. On her father\'s side, Jolie is of German and Slovak descent, and on her mother\'s side, she is of primarily French-Canadian, Dutch, and German ancestry. Like her mother, Jolie has stated that she is part Iroquois, although her only known indigenous ancestors were 17th-century Hurons.\n\nAfter her parents\' separation in 1976, Jolie and her brother lived with their mother, who had abandoned her acting ambitions to focus on raising her children. As a child, she often watched films with her mother and it was this, rather than her father\'s successful career, that inspired her interest in acting, though at age five she had a bit part in Voight\'s Lookin\' to Get Out (1982). When Jolie was six years old, Bertrand and her live-in partner, filmmaker Bill Day, moved the family to Palisades, New York;they returned to Los Angeles five years later. Jolie then decided she wanted to act and enrolled at the Lee Strasberg Theatre Institute, where she trained for two years and appeared in several stage productions.\n\nJolie first attended Beverly Hills High School, where she felt isolated among the children of some of the area\'s affluent families, because her mother survived on a more modest income. She was teased by other students, who targeted her for being extremely thin and for wearing glasses and braces. Her early attempts at modeling, at her mother\'s insistence, proved unsuccessful. She then transferred to Moreno High School, an alternative school, where she became a \"punk outsider,\" wearing all-black clothing, going out moshing, and experimenting with knife play with her live-in boyfriend. She dropped out of her acting classes and aspired to become a funeral director, taking at-home courses to study embalming. At age 16, after the relationship had ended, Jolie graduated from high school and rented her own apartment, before returning to theater studies, though in 2004 she referred to this period with the observation, \"I am still at heartand always will bejust a punk kid with tattoos.\"\n\nAs a teenager, Jolie found it difficult to emotionally connect with other people, and as a result she self-harmed, later commenting, \"For some reason, the ritual of having cut myself and feeling the pain, maybe feeling alive, feeling some kind of release, it was somehow therapeutic to me.\" She also struggled with insomnia and an eating disorder, and began experimenting with drugs; by age 20, she had used \"just about every drug possible,\" particularly heroin. Jolie suffered episodes of depression and twice planned to commit suicideat age 19 and again at 22, when she attempted to hire a hitman to kill her. When she was 24, she experienced a nervous breakdown and was admitted for 72 hours to UCLA Medical Center\'s psychiatric ward. Two years later, after adopting her first child, Jolie found stability in her life, later stating, \"I knew once I committed to Maddox, I would never be self-destructive again.\"\n\nJolie has had a lifelong dysfunctional relationship with her father, which began when Voight left the family when his daughter was less than a year old. She has said that from then on their time together was sporadic and usually carried out in front of the press. They reconciled when they appeared together in Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001), but their relationship again deteriorated. Jolie petitioned the court to legally remove her surname \"Voight\" in favor of her middle name, which she had long used as a stage name; the name change was granted on September 12, 2002. Voight then went public with their estrangement during an appearance on Access Hollywood, in which he claimed Jolie had \"serious mental problems.\" At that point, her mother and brother also broke off contact with Voight. They did not speak for six-and-a-half years, but began rebuilding their relationship in the wake of Bertrand\'s death from ovarian cancer on January 27, 2007, before going public with their reconciliation three years later.\n\nJolie had a serious boyfriend for two years from the age of 14. Her mother allowed them to live together in her home, of which Jolie later said, \"I was either going to be reckless on the streets with my boyfriend or he was going to be with me in my bedroom with my mom in the next room. She made the choice, and because of it, I continued to go to school every morning and explored my first relationship in a safe way.\" She has compared the relationship to a marriage in its emotional intensity, and said that the breakup compelled her to dedicate herself to her acting career at the age of 16.\n\nDuring filming of Hackers (1995), Jolie had a romance with British actor Jonny Lee Miller, her first lover since the relationship in her early teens. They were not in touch for many months after production ended, but eventually reconnected and married soon after on March 28, 1996. She attended her wedding in black rubber pants and a white T-shirt, upon which she had written the groom\'s name in her blood. Jolie and Miller separated in September 1997 and divorced on February 3, 1999. They remained on good terms, and Jolie later explained, \"It comes down to timing. I think he\'s the greatest husband a girl could ask for. I\'ll always love him, we were simply too young.\"\n\nJolie began a relationship with model-actress Jenny Shimizu on the set of Foxfire (1996). She later said, \"I would probably have married Jenny if I hadn\'t married my husband. I fell in love with her the first second I saw her.\" According to Shimizu, their relationship lasted many years and continued even while Jolie was romantically involved with other people, though it had ended by 2005. In 2003, when asked if she was bisexual, Jolie responded, \"Of course. If I fell in love with a woman tomorrow, would I feel that it\'s okay to want to kiss and touch her? If I fell in love with her? Absolutely! Yes!\"\n\n\n\n After a two-month courtship, Jolie married actor Billy Bob Thornton on May 5, 2000, in Las Vegas. They met on the set of Pushing Tin (1999), but did not pursue a relationship at that time as Thornton was engaged to actress Laura Dern, while Jolie was reportedly dating actor Timothy Hutton, her co-star in Playing God (1997). As a result of their frequent public declarations of passion and gestures of lovemost famously wearing one another\'s blood in vials around their neckstheir marriage became a favorite topic of the entertainment media. Jolie and Thornton announced the adoption of a child from Cambodia in March 2002, but abruptly separated three months later. Their divorce was finalized on May 27, 2003. When asked about the sudden dissolution of their marriage, Jolie stated, \"It took me by surprise, too, because overnight, we totally changed. I think one day we had just nothing in common. And it\'s scary but... I think it can happen when you get involved and you don\'t know yourself yet.\"\n\nIn early 2005, Jolie was involved in a well-publicized Hollywood scandal when she was accused of being the reason for the divorce of actors Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston. She and Pitt were alleged to have started an affair during filming of Mr. & Mrs. Smith (2005). Jolie stated on several occasions that this was not true, but later said that they \"fell in love\" on the set. She explained in 2005, \"To be intimate with a married man, when my own father cheated on my mother, is not something I could forgive. I could not look at myself in the morning if I did that. I wouldn\'t be attracted to a man who would cheat on his wife.\"Jolie and Pitt did not publicly comment on the nature of their relationship until January 2006, when Jolie confirmed that she was pregnant with Pitt\'s child. They announced their engagement in April 2012, after seven years together, and married on August 23, 2014, at their estate Chteau Miraval in Correns, France. Jolie took on Pitt\'s name following their marriage. As a couple, they are dubbed \"Brangelina\" by the entertainment media, and are the subject of worldwide media coverage.\n\nOn March 10, 2002, Jolie adopted her first child, seven-month-old Maddox Chivan, from an orphanage in Battambang, Cambodia. He was born as Rath Vibol on August 5, 2001,in a local village. After twice visiting Cambodia, while filming Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001) and on a UNHCR field mission, Jolie returned in November 2001 with her husband, Billy Bob Thornton, where they met Maddox and subsequently applied to adopt him. The adoption process was halted the following month when the U.S. government banned adoptions from Cambodia amid allegations of child trafficking. Although Jolie\'s adoption facilitator was later convicted of visa fraud and money laundering, her adoption of Maddox was deemed lawful. Once the process was finalized, she took custody of him in Namibia, where she was filming Beyond Borders (2003). Jolie and Thornton announced the adoption together, but she adopted Maddox alone, and raised him as a single parent following their separation three months later.\n\n\n\n A pregnant Jolie with director Clint Eastwood at the Cannes premiere of Changeling in May 2008 Jolie adopted a daughter, six-month-old Zahara Marley, from an orphanage in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, on July 6, 2005. Zahara was born as Yemsrach on January 8, 2005, in Awasa. Jolie initially believed Zahara to be an AIDS orphan, based on official testimony from her grandmother,but her birth mother later came forward in the media. She explained that she had abandoned her family when Zahara became sick, and said she thought Zahara was \"very fortunate\" to have been adopted by Jolie. Jolie was accompanied by her partner, Brad Pitt, when she traveled to Ethiopia to take custody of Zahara. She later indicated that they had together made the decision to adopt from Ethiopia, having first visited the country earlier that year. After Pitt announced his intention to adopt her children, she filed a petition to legally change their surname from Jolie to Jolie-Pitt, which was granted on January 19, 2006. Pitt adopted Maddox and Zahara soon after.\n\nIn an attempt to avoid the unprecedented media frenzy surrounding their relationship, Jolie and Pitt traveled to Namibia for the birth of their first biological child. On May 27, 2006, she gave birth to a daughter, Shiloh Nouvel, in Swakopmund.They sold the first pictures of Shiloh through the distributor Getty Images with the aim of benefiting charity, rather than allowing paparazzi to make these valuable photographs.[184] People and Hello! purchased the North American and British rights to the images for $4.1 and $3.5 million respectively, a record in celebrity photojournalism at that time, with all proceeds donated to UNICEF.\n\nOn March 15, 2007, Jolie adopted a son, three-year-old Pax Thien, from an orphanage in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. He was born as Pham Quang Sang on November 29, 2003, in HCMC, where he was abandoned by his biological mother soon after birth. After visiting the orphanage with Pitt in November 2006, Jolie applied for adoption as a single parent, because Vietnam\'s adoption regulations do not allow unmarried couples to co-adopt. After their return to the U.S., she petitioned the court to change her son\'s surname from Jolie to Jolie-Pitt, which was approved on May 31. Pitt subsequently adopted Pax on February 21, 2008.\n\nAt the Cannes Film Festival in May 2008, Jolie confirmed that she was expecting twins. For the two weeks she spent in a seaside hospital in Nice, France, reporters and photographers camped outside on the promenade. She gave birth to a son, Knox Lon, and a daughter, Vivienne Marcheline, on July 12, 2008. The first pictures of Knox and Vivienne were jointly sold to People and Hello! for a reported $14 millionthe most expensive celebrity photographs ever taken. All proceeds were donated to the Jolie-Pitt Foundation.\n\nJolie committed to acting professionally at the age of 16, but initially found it difficult to pass auditions, often being told that her demeanor was \"too dark.\" She appeared in five of her brother\'s student films, made while he attended the USC School of Cinema-Television, as well as in several music videos, namely Lenny Kravitz\'s \"Stand by My Woman\" (1991), Antonello Venditti\'s \"Alta Marea\" (1991), The Lemonheads\'s \"It\'s About Time\" (1993), and Meat Loaf\'s \"Rock and Roll Dreams Come Through\" (1993). She began to learn from her father, as she noticed his method of observing people to become like them. Their relationship during this time was less strained, with Jolie realizing that they were both \"drama queens.\"\n\nJolie began her professional film career in 1993, when she played her first leading role in the straight-to-video science-fiction sequel Cyborg 2, as a near-human robot designed for corporate espionage and assassination. She was so disappointed with the film that she did not audition again for a year. Following a supporting role in the independent film Without Evidence (1995), she starred in her first Hollywood picture, Hackers (1995). The New York Times critic Janet Maslin wrote, \"Kate stands out. That\'s because she scowls even more sourly than [her co-stars] and is that rare female hacker who sits intently at her keyboard in a see-through top.\" Hackers failed to make a profit at the box office, but developed a cult following after its video release.\n\nAfter starring in the modern-day Romeo and Juliet adaptation Love Is All There Is (1996), Jolie appeared in the road movie Mojave Moon (1996), of which The Hollywood Reporter said, \"Jolie, an actress whom the camera truly adores, reveals a comic flair and the kind of blatant sexuality that makes it entirely credible that Danny Aiello\'s character would drop everything just for the chance of being with her.\" In Foxfire (1996) she played a drifter who unites four teenage girls against a teacher who has sexually harassed them. Jack Mathews of the Los Angeles Times wrote of her performance, \"It took a lot of hogwash to develop this character, but Jolie, Jon Voight\'s knockout daughter, has the presence to overcome the stereotype. Though the story is narrated by Maddy, Legs is the subject and the catalyst.\"\n\nIn 1997, Jolie starred with David Duchovny in the thriller Playing God, set in the Los Angeles underworld. The film was not well received by critics; Chicago Sun-Times critic Roger Ebert noted that Jolie \"finds a certain warmth in a kind of role that is usually hard and aggressive; she seems too nice to be [a mobster\'s] girlfriend, and maybe she is.\" Her next work, as a frontierswoman in the CBS miniseries True Women (1997), was even less successful; writing for The Philadelphia Inquirer, Robert Strauss dismissed her as \"horrid, a fourth-rate Scarlett O\'Hara\" who relies on \"gnashed teeth and overly pouted lips.\" Jolie also starred in the music video for the Rolling Stones\'s \"Anybody Seen My Baby?\" as a stripper who leaves mid-performance to wander New York City.\n\nJolie\'s career prospects began to improve after she won a Golden Globe Award for her performance in TNT\'s George Wallace (1997), about the life of the segregationist Alabama Governor and presidential candidate George Wallace, played by Gary Sinise. Jolie portrayed Wallace\'s second wife, Cornelia, a performance Lee Winfrey of The Philadelphia Inquirer considered a highlight of the film. George Wallace was very well received by critics and won, among other awards, the Golden Globe Award for Best Miniseries or Television Film. Jolie also received a nomination for an Emmy Award for her performance.\n\nJolie\'s first breakthrough came when she portrayed supermodel Gia Carangi in HBO\'s Gia (1998). The film chronicles the destruction of Carangi\'s life and career as a result of her addiction to heroin, and her decline and death from AIDS in the mid-1980s. Vanessa Vance of Reel.com retrospectively noted, \"Jolie gained wide recognition for her role as the titular Gia, and it\'s easy to see why. Jolie is fierce in her portrayalfilling the part with nerve, charm, and desperationand her role in this film is quite possibly the most beautiful train wreck ever filmed.\" For the second consecutive year, Jolie won a Golden Globe Award and was nominated for an Emmy Award. She also won her first Screen Actors Guild Award.\n\nIn accordance with Lee Strasberg\'s method acting, Jolie preferred to stay in character in between scenes during many of her early films, and as a result had gained a reputation for being difficult to deal with. While shooting Gia, she told her husband, Jonny Lee Miller, that she would not be able to phone him: \"I\'d tell him: \'I\'m alone; I\'m dying; I\'m gay; I\'m not going to see you for weeks.\'\" After Gia wrapped, she briefly gave up acting, because she felt that she had \"nothing else to give.\" She separated from Miller and moved to New York, where she took night classes at New York University to study directing and screenwriting.[7] Encouraged by her Golden Globe Award win for George Wallace and the positive critical reception of Gia, Jolie resumed her career.\n\nFollowing the previously filmed gangster film Hell\'s Kitchen (1998), Jolie returned to the screen in Playing by Heart (1998), part of an ensemble cast that included Sean Connery, Gillian Anderson, and Ryan Phillippe. The film received predominantly positive reviews, and Jolie was praised in particular; San Francisco Chronicle critic Peter Stack wrote, \"Jolie, working through an overwritten part, is a sensation as the desperate club crawler learning truths about what she\'s willing to gamble.\" She won the Breakthrough Performance Award from the National Board of Review.\n\nIn 1999, Jolie starred in the comedy-drama Pushing Tin, alongside John Cusack, Billy Bob Thornton, and Cate Blanchett. The film met with mixed reception from critics, and Jolie\'s characterThornton\'s seductive wifewas particularly criticized; writing for The Washington Post, Desson Howe dismissed her as \"a completely ludicrous writer\'s creation of a free-spirited woman who weeps over hibiscus plants that die, wears lots of turquoise rings and gets real lonely when Russell spends entire nights away from home.\" Jolie then co-starred with Denzel Washington in The Bone Collector (1999), playing a police officer who reluctantly helps Washington\'s paraplegic detective track down a serial killer. The film grossed $151.5 million worldwide, but was critically unsuccessful. Terry Lawson of the Detroit Free Press concluded, \"Jolie, while always delicious to look at, is simply and woefully miscast.\"\n\n\"Jolie is emerging as one of the great wild spirits of current movies, a loose cannon who somehow has deadly aim.\"\n\nJolie next took the supporting role of a sociopathic mental patient in Girl, Interrupted (1999), an adaptation of Susanna Kaysen\'s memoir of the same name. While Winona Ryder played the main character in what was hoped to be a comeback for her, the film instead marked Jolie\'s final breakthrough in Hollywood.[40] She won her third Golden Globe Award, her second Screen Actors Guild Award, and an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. For Variety, Emanuel Levy noted, \"Jolie is excellent as the flamboyant, irresponsible girl who turns out to be far more instrumental than the doctors in Susanna\'s rehabilitation.\"\n\nIn 2000, Jolie appeared in her first summer blockbuster, Gone in 60 Seconds, which became her highest-grossing film to that point, earning $237.2 million internationally. She had a minor role as the mechanic ex-girlfriend of a car thief played by Nicolas Cage; The Washington Post writer Stephen Hunter criticized that \"all she does in this movie is stand around, cooling down, modeling those fleshy, pulsating muscle-tubes that nest so provocatively around her teeth.\" Jolie later explained that the film had been a welcome relief after her emotionally demanding role in Girl, Interrupted.\n\nAlthough highly regarded for her acting abilities, Jolie had rarely found films that appealed to a wide audience, but Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001) made her an international superstar. An adaptation of the popular Tomb Raider videogames, the film required her to learn an English accent and undergo extensive martial arts training to play the archaeologist-adventurer Lara Croft. Although the film generated mostly negative reviews, Jolie was generally praised for her physical performance; Newsday\'s John Anderson commented, \"Jolie makes the title character a virtual icon of female competence and coolth.\" The film was an international hit, earning $274.7 million worldwide, and launched her global reputation as a female action star.\n\nJolie next starred opposite Antonio Banderas as his mail-order bride in Original Sin (2001), the first of a string of films that were poorly received by critics and audiences alike. The New York Times critic Elvis Mitchell questioned Jolie\'s decision to follow her Oscar-winning performance with \"soft-core nonsense.\" The romantic comedy Life or Something Like It (2002), though equally unsuccessful, marked an unusual choice for Jolie. Salon\'s Allen Barra considered her ambitious newscaster character a rare attempt at playing a conventional women\'s role, noting that her performance \"doesn\'t get off the ground until a scene where she goes punk and leads a group of striking bus workers in singing \'Satisfaction.\'\" Despite her lack of box office success, Jolie remained in demand as an actress; in 2002, she established herself among Hollywood\'s highest-paid actresses, earning $10$15 million per film for the next five years.\n\nJolie reprised her role as Lara Croft in Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life (2003), which was not as lucrative as the original, earning $156.5 million at the international box office. She also starred in the music video for Korn\'s \"Did My Time\", which was used to promote the sequel. Her next film was Beyond Borders (2003), in which she portrayed a socialite who joins an aid worker played by Clive Owen. Though unsuccessful with audiences, the film stands as the first of several passion projects Jolie has made to bring attention to humanitarian causes. Beyond Borders was a critical failure; Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times acknowledged Jolie\'s ability to \"bring electricity and believability to roles,\" but wrote that \"the limbo of a hybrid character, a badly written cardboard person in a fly-infested, blood-and-guts world, completely defeats her.\"\n\nThe year 2004 saw the release of four films featuring Jolie. She first starred in the thriller Taking Lives as an FBI profiler summoned to help Montreal law enforcement hunt down a serial killer. The film received mixed reviews; The Hollywood Reporter critic Kirk Honeycutt concluded, \"Jolie plays a role that definitely feels like something she has already done, but she does add an unmistakable dash of excitement and glamour.\" Jolie made a brief appearance as a fighter pilot in Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow, a science fiction adventure shot entirely with actors in front of a bluescreen, and voiced her first family film, the DreamWorks animation Shark Tale. Her supporting role as Queen Olympias in Oliver Stone\'s Alexander, about the life of Alexander the Great, was met with mixed reception, particularly concerning her Slavic accent.Commercially, the film failed in North America, which Stone attributed to disapproval of the depiction of Alexander\'s bisexuality, but it succeeded internationally, for a total revenue of $167.3 million.\n\nIn 2005, Jolie finally returned to major box office success with the action-comedy Mr. & Mrs. Smith, in which she starred opposite Brad Pitt as a bored married couple who find out that they are both secret assassins. The film received mixed reviews, but was generally lauded for the chemistry between the two leads; Star Tribune critic Colin Covert noted, \"While the story feels haphazard, the movie gets by on gregarious charm, galloping energy and the stars\' thermonuclear screen chemistry.\" With box office takings of $478.2 million worldwide, Mr. & Mrs. Smith was the seventh-highest grossing picture of the year and remained Jolie\'s highest-grossing live-action film for the next decade.\n\nFollowing a supporting role as the neglected wife of a CIA officer in Robert De Niro\'s The Good Shepherd (2006), Jolie starred as Mariane Pearl in the documentary-style drama A Mighty Heart (2007). Based on Pearl\'s memoir of the same name, the film chronicles the kidnapping and murder of her husband, The Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl, in Pakistan. Although the biracial Pearl had personally chosen Jolie for the role, the casting drew racial criticism and accusations of blackface. The resulting performance was widely praised; Ray Bennett of The Hollywood Reporter described it as \"well-measured and moving,\" played \"with respect and a firm grasp on a difficult accent.\" She received nominations for a Golden Globe Award and a Screen Actors Guild Award. Jolie also played a shape-shifting seductress, Grendel\'s mother, in the epic Beowulf (2007), created through motion capture. The film was critically and commercially well received, taking in revenues of $196.4 million worldwide.\n\nBy 2008, Jolie was considered the highest-paid actress in Hollywood, earning $15$20 million per film. While other actresses had been forced to take salary cuts in recent years, Jolie\'s perceived box office appeal allowed her to command as much as $20 million plus a percentage. She starred alongside James McAvoy and Morgan Freeman in the action film Wanted (2008), which proved an international success, earning $341.4 million worldwide. The film received predominantly favorable reviews; writing for The New York Times, Manohla Dargis noted that Jolie was \"perfectly cast as a super-scary, seemingly amoral assassin,\" adding that \"she cuts the kind of disciplinarian figure who can bring boys of all ages to their knees or at least into their theater seats.\"\n\nJolie next took the lead role in Clint Eastwood\'s drama Changeling (2008). Based in part on the Wineville Chicken Coop Murders, the film centers on Christine Collins, who is reunited with her kidnapped son in 1928 Los Angeles, only to realize the boy is an imposter. Chicago Tribune critic Michael Phillips noted, \"Jolie really shines in the calm before the storm, the scenes when one patronizing male authority figure after another belittles her at their peril.\" She received nominations for a Golden Globe Award, a Screen Actors Guild Award, a BAFTA Award, and an Academy Award for Best Actress. Jolie also voiced the DreamWorks animation Kung Fu Panda (2008), the first work in a major family franchise, later reprising her voice role in the sequel Kung Fu Panda 2 (2011) and two television shorts.\n\nAfter her mother\'s death in 2007, Jolie began appearing in fewer films, later explaining that her motivation to be an actress had stemmed from her mother\'s acting ambitions. Her first film in two years was the thriller Salt (2010), in which she starred as a CIA agent who goes on the run after she is accused of being a KGB sleeper agent. Originally written as a male character with Tom Cruise attached to star, agent Salt underwent a gender change after a Columbia Pictures executive suggested Jolie for the role. With revenues of $293.5 million, Salt became an international success. The film received generally positive reviews, with Jolie\'s performance in particular earning praise; Empire critic William Thomas remarked, \"When it comes to selling incredible, crazy, death-defying antics, Jolie has few peers in the action business.\"\n\nJolie starred opposite Johnny Depp in the thriller The Tourist (2010). The film was a critical failure, though Roger Ebert defended Jolie\'s performance, stating that she \"does her darndest\" and \"plays her femme fatale with flat-out, drop-dead sexuality.\" Despite the poor critical reception, after a slow start at the North American box office, the film went on to gross a respectable $278.3 million worldwide, cementing Jolie\'s appeal to international audiences. She received a Golden Globe Award nomination for her performance, which gave rise to speculation that it had been given merely to ensure her high-profile presence at the awards ceremony.\n\nAfter directing the documentary A Place in Time (2007), which was distributed through the National Education Association, Jolie made her feature directorial debut with In the Land of Blood and Honey (2011), a love story between a Serb soldier and a Bosniak prisoner, set during the 199295 Bosnian War. She conceived the film to rekindle attention for the survivors, after twice visiting Bosnia and Herzegovina in her role as a UNHCR Goodwill Ambassador. To ensure authenticity, she cast only actors from the former Yugoslaviaincluding stars Goran Kosti and Zana Marjanoviand incorporated their wartime experiences into her screenplay. Upon release, the film received mixed reviews; Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter wrote, \"Jolie deserves significant credit for creating such a powerfully oppressive atmosphere and staging the ghastly events so credibly, even if it is these very strengths that will make people not want to watch what\'s onscreen.\" The film was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Language Film, and Jolie was named an honorary citizen of Sarajevo for raising awareness of the war.\n\nAfter a three-and-a-half-year absence from the screen, Jolie starred in Maleficent (2014), a live-action re-imagining of Disney\'s 1959 animation Sleeping Beauty. Critical reception was mixed, but Jolie\'s performance in the titular role was singled out for praise; The Hollywood Reporter critic Sherri Linden found her to be the \"heart and soul\" of the film, adding that she \"doesn\'t chew the estimable scenery in Maleficentshe infuses it, wielding a magnetic and effortless power.\" In its opening weekend, Maleficent earned nearly $70 million at the North American box office and over $100 million in other markets, marking Jolie\'s appeal to audiences of all demographics in both action and fantasy films, genres usually dominated by male actors. The film went on to gross $757.8 million worldwide, becoming the fourth-highest grossing film of the year and Jolie\'s highest-grossing film ever.\n\nJolie next completed her second directorial venture, Unbroken (2014), about World War II hero Louis Zamperini (19172014), a former Olympic track star who survived a plane crash over sea and spent two years in a Japanese prisoner-of-war camp. Based on Laura Hillenbrand\'s biography of the same name, the film was scripted by the Coen brothers and starred Jack O\'Connell. After a positive early reception, Unbroken was considered a likely Best Picture and Best Director contender, but it ultimately received mixed reviews and little award recognition,[80] though it was named one of the best films of the year by the National Board of Review and the American Film Institute. In a typical review, Variety\'s Justin Chang noted Jolie\'s \"impeccable craftsmanship and sober restraint\" as a filmmaker, but found the film \"an extraordinary story told in dutiful, unexceptional terms.\" Financially, Unbroken far outperformed industry expectations in its opening weekend, eventually earning over $160 million worldwide.\n\nScheduled for a 2015 release, Jolie\'s third directorial effort, By the Sea, is a romantic drama about a marriage in crisis, based on her screenplay. She stars opposite her husband, Brad Pitt, in their first collaboration since 2005\'s Mr. & Mrs. Smith. Jolie is next expected to direct Africa, about Kenyan conservationist Richard Leakey\'s fight against the illegal ivory trade.\n\n\"We cannot close ourselves off to information and ignore the fact that millions of people are out there suffering. I honestly want to help. I don\'t believe I feel differently from other people. I think we all want justice and equality, a chance for a life with meaning. All of us would like to believe that if we were in a bad situation someone would help us.\"\n\nJolie first witnessed the effects of a humanitarian crisis while filming Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001) in war-torn Cambodia, an experience she later credited with having brought her a greater understanding of the world. Upon her return home, she contacted the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) for information on international trouble spots. To learn more about the conditions in these areas, she began visiting refugee camps around the world. In February 2001, she went on her first field visit, an 18-day mission to Sierra Leone and Tanzania; she later expressed her shock at what she had witnessed.\n\nIn the following months, Jolie returned to Cambodia for two weeks and met with Afghan refugees in Pakistan, where she donated $1 million in response to an international UNHCR emergency appeal, the largest donation UNHCR had ever received from a private individual. She covered all costs related to her missions and shared the same rudimentary working and living conditions as UNHCR field staff on all of her visits. Jolie was named a UNHCR Goodwill Ambassador at UNHCR headquarters in Geneva on August 27, 2001.\n\n\n\n Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and Jolie at a UNHCR celebration of World Refugee Day in June 2005 Over the next decade, she went on more than 40 field missions, meeting with refugees and internally displaced persons in over 30 countries. In 2002, when asked what she hoped to accomplish, she stated, \"Awareness of the plight of these people. I think they should be commended for what they have survived, not looked down upon.\" To that end, her 2001-02 field visits were chronicled in her book Notes from My Travels, which was published in October 2003 in conjunction with the release of her humanitarian drama Beyond Borders.\n\nJolie aimed to visit what she termed \"forgotten emergencies,\" crises that media attention had shifted away from. She became noted for travelling to war zones, such as Sudan\'s Darfur region during the Darfur conflict, the Syrian-Iraqi border during the Second Gulf War, where she met privately with U.S. troops and other multi-national forces, and the Afghan capital Kabul during the war in Afghanistan, where three aid workers were murdered in the midst of her first visit. To aid her travels, she began taking flying lessons in 2004 with the aim of ferrying aid workers and food supplies around the world; she now holds a private pilot license with instrument rating and owns a Cirrus SR22 and Cessna 208 Caravan single-engine aircraft.\n\nOn April 17, 2012, after more than a decade of service as a UNHCR Goodwill Ambassador, Jolie was promoted to the rank of Special Envoy to High Commissioner Antnio Guterres, the first to take on such a position within the organization. In her expanded role, she was given authority to represent Guterres and UNHCR at the diplomatic level, with a focus on major refugee crises. In the months following her promotion, she made her first visit as Special Envoyher third over allto Ecuador, where she met with Colombian refugees, and she accompanied Guterres on a week-long tour of Jordan, Lebanon, Turkey, and Iraq, to assess the situation of refugees from neighboring Syria.Since then, Jolie has gone on a dozen field missions around the world to meet with refugees and undertake advocacy on their behalf.\n\nIn an effort to connect her Cambodian-born son with his heritage, Jolie purchased a house in his country of birth in 2003. The traditional home sat on 39 hectares in the northwestern province Battambang, adjacent to Samlout national park in the Cardamom mountains, which had become infiltrated with poachers who threatened endangered species. She purchased the park\'s 60,000 hectares and turned the area into a wildlife reserve named for her son, the Maddox Jolie Project.[109] In recognition of her conservation efforts, King Norodom Sihamoni awarded her Cambodian citizenship on July 31, 2005.[110]\n\nIn November 2006, Jolie expanded the scope of the projectrenamed the Maddox Jolie-Pitt Foundation (MJP)to create Asia\'s first Millennium Village, in accordance with UN development goals.[111] She was inspired by a meeting with the founder of Millennium Promise, noted economist Jeffrey Sachs, at the World Economic Forum in Davos,[109] where she was an invited speaker in 2005 and 2006. Together they filmed a 2005 MTV special, The Diary of Angelina Jolie & Dr. Jeffrey Sachs in Africa, which followed them on a trip to a Millennium Village in western Kenya. By mid-2007, some 6,000 villagers and 72 employeessome of them former poachers employed as rangerslived and worked at MJP, in ten villages previously isolated from one another. The compound includes schools, roads, and a soy milk factory, all funded by Jolie. Her home functions as the MJP field headquarters.\n\nAfter filming Beyond Borders (2003) in Namibia, Jolie became patron of the Harnas Wildlife Foundation, a wildlife orphanage and medical center in the Kalahari desert. She first visited the Harnas farm during production of the film, which features vultures rescued by the foundation. In December 2010, Jolie and her partner, Brad Pitt, established the Shiloh Jolie-Pitt Foundation to support conservation work by the Naankuse Wildlife Sanctuary, a nature reserve also located in the Kalahari. In name of their Namibian-born daughter, they have funded large-animal conservation projects as well as a free health clinic, housing, and a school for the San Bushmen community at Naankuse. Jolie and Pitt support other causes through the Jolie-Pitt Foundation, established in September 2006.\n\nJolie has pushed for legislation to aid child immigrants and other vulnerable children in both the U.S. and developing nations, including the \"Unaccompanied Alien Child Protection Act of 2005.\" She began lobbying humanitarian interests in the U.S. capital from 2003 onwards, explaining, \"As much as I would love to never have to visit Washington, that\'s the way to move the ball.\" Since October 2008, she has co-chaired Kids in Need of Defense (KIND), a network of leading U.S. law firms that provide free legal aid to unaccompanied minors in immigration proceedings across the U.S. Founded in a collaboration between Jolie and the Microsoft Corporation, by 2013, KIND had become the principal provider of pro bono lawyers for immigrant children. Jolie had previously, from 2005 to 2007, funded the launch of a similar initiative, the U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants\' National Center for Refugee and Immigrant Children.\n\nJolie has also advocated for children\'s education. Since its founding at the Clinton Global Initiative\'s annual meeting in September 2007, she has co-chaired the Education Partnership for Children of Conflict, which provides policy and funding to education programs for children in conflict-affected regions. In its first year, the partnership supported education projects for Iraqi refugee children, youth affected by the Darfur conflict, and girls in rural Afghanistan, among other affected groups. The partnership has worked closely with the Council on Foreign Relations\' Center for Universal Educationfounded by the partnership\'s co-chair, noted economist Gene Sperlingto establish education policies, which resulted in recommendations made to UN agencies, G8 development agencies, and the World Bank. Since April 2013, all proceeds from Jolie\'s high-end jewelry collection, Style of Jolie, have benefited the partnership\'s work.\n\nJolie has funded a school and boarding facility for girls at Kakuma refugee camp in northwestern Kenya, which opened in 2005, and two primary schools for girls in the returnee settlements Tangi and Qalai Gudar in eastern Afghanistan, which opened in March 2010 and November 2012 respectively. In addition to the facilities at the Millennium Village she established in Cambodia, Jolie had built at least ten other schools in the country by 2005. In February 2006, she opened the Maddox Chivan Children\'s Center, a medical and educational facility for children affected by HIV, in the Cambodian capital Phnom Penh. In Sebeta, Ethiopia, the birthplace of her eldest daughter, she funds a sister facility, the Zahara Children\'s Center, which is expected to open in 2015 and will treat and educate children suffering from HIV or tuberculosis. Both centers are run by the Global Health Committee.\n\nAfter Jolie joined the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) in June 2007, she hosted a symposium on international law and justice at CFR headquarters and funded several CFR special reports, including \"Intervention to Stop Genocide and Mass Atrocities.\"In January 2011, she established the Jolie Legal Fellowship, a network of lawyers and attorneys who are sponsored to advocate the development of human rights in their countries. Its member attorneys, called Jolie Legal Fellows, have facilitated child protection efforts in Haiti in the wake of the 2010 earthquake and promoted the development of an inclusive democratic process in Libya following the 2011 revolution.\n\nJolie has fronted a campaign against sexual violence in military conflict zones by the UK government, which made the issue a priority of its 2013 G8 presidency. In May 2012, she launched the Preventing Sexual Violence Initiative (PSVI) with Foreign Secretary William Hague, who was inspired to campaign on the issue by her Bosnian war drama In the Land of Blood and Honey (2011). PSVI was established to complement wider UK government work by raising awareness and promoting international co-operation.Jolie spoke on the subject at the G8 foreign ministers meeting, where the attending nations adopted a historic declaration, and before the UN security council, which responded by adopting its broadest resolution on the issue to date. In June 2014, she co-chaired the four-day Global Summit to End Sexual Violence in Conflict, the largest-ever meeting on the subject, attended by 123 nations. It resulted in a protocol endorsed by 151 countries.\n\nIn February 2015, Jolie and Hague launched the UK\'s first academic Centre on Women, Peace and Security, based at the London School of Economics and Political Science. The Centre aims to contribute to global women\'s rights issues, including the prosecution of war rape and women\'s engagement in politics, through academic research, a post-graduate teaching program, public engagement, and collaboration with international organizations.\n\nJolie has received wide recognition for her humanitarian work. In August 2002, she received the inaugural Humanitarian Award from the Church World Service\'s Immigration and Refugee Program, and in October 2003, she was the first recipient of the Citizen of the World Award by the United Nations Correspondents Association. She was awarded the Global Humanitarian Award by the UNA-USA in October 2005, and she received the Freedom Award from the International Rescue Committee in November 2007. In October 2011, UN High Commissioner for Refugees Antnio Guterres presented Jolie with a gold pin reserved for the most long-serving staff, in recognition of her decade as a UNHCR Goodwill Ambassador.\n\nIn November 2013, Jolie received the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award, an honorary Academy Award, from the Board of Governors of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.\n\nIn June 2014, she was appointed an Honorary Dame Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George (DCMG) for her services to the UK\'s foreign policy and campaigning to end sexual violence in war zones. Queen Elizabeth II presented Jolie with the insignia of her honorary damehood during a private ceremony the following October.\n\nOn February 16, 2013, at age 37, Jolie underwent a preventive double mastectomy after learning she had an 87% risk of developing breast cancer due to a defective BRCA1 gene. Her maternal family history warranted genetic testing for BRCA mutations: her mother, actress Marcheline Bertrand, had breast cancer and died from ovarian cancer, while her grandmother died from ovarian cancer. Her aunt, who had the same BRCA1 defect, died from breast cancer three months after Jolie\'s operation. Following the mastectomy, which lowered her chances of developing breast cancer to under 5 percent, Jolie had reconstructive surgery involving implants and allografts. Two years later, in March 2015, after annual test results indicated possible signs of early ovarian cancer, she underwent a preventive oophorectomy, as she had a 50% risk of developing ovarian cancer due to the same genetic anomaly. Despite hormone replacement therapy, the surgery brought on premature menopause.\n\n\"I choose not to keep my story private because there are many women who do not know that they might be living under the shadow of cancer. It is my hope that they, too, will be able to get gene tested, and that if they have a high risk they, too, will know that they have strong options.\"\n\nJolie on her reasons for speaking out about her mastectomy After completing each operation, Jolie discussed her mastectomy and oophorectomy in op-eds published by The New York Times, with the aim of helping other women make informed health choices. She detailed her diagnosis, surgeries, and personal experiences, and described her decision to undergo preventive surgery as a proactive measure for the sake of her six children. Jolie further wrote, \"On a personal note, I do not feel any less of a woman. I feel empowered that I made a strong choice that in no way diminishes my femininity.\"\n\nJolie\'s announcement of her mastectomy attracted widespread publicity and discussion on BRCA mutations and genetic testing. Her decision was met with praise from various public figures, while health campaigners welcomed her raising awareness of the options available to at-risk women. Dubbed \"The Angelina Effect\" by a Time cover story, Jolie\'s influence led to a \"global and long-lasting\" increase in BRCA gene testing: the number of referrals tripled in Australia and doubled in the UK, parts of Canada, and India, as well as significantly increased in other European countries and the U.S. Researchers in Canada and the UK found that despite the large increase, the percentage of mutation carriers remained the same, meaning Jolie\'s message had reached those most at risk. In her first op-ed, Jolie had advocated wider accessibility of BRCA gene testing and acknowledged the high costs, which were greatly reduced after the U.S. Supreme Court, in a June 2013 ruling, invalidated BRCA gene patents held by Myriad Genetics.\n\nAs the daughter of actor Jon Voight, Jolie appeared in the media from an early age. After embarking on her own career, she earned a reputation as a \"wild child,\" which contributed to her early success in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Celebrity profiles routinely covered her fascination with blood and knives, experiences with drugs, and her sex life, particularly her bisexuality and interest in sadomasochism. In 2000, when asked about her outspokenness, she stated, \"I say things that other people might go through. That\'s what artists should dothrow things out there and not be perfect and not have answers for anything and see if people understand.\" Another contributing factor of her controversial image were tabloid rumors of incest that started when Jolie, upon winning her Oscar, kissed her brother on the lips and said, \"I\'m so in love with my brother right now.\" She dismissed the rumors, saying, \"It was disappointing that something so beautiful and pure could be turned into a circus,\" and explained that, as children of divorce, she and James relied on one another for emotional support.\n\nJolie\'s reputation began to change positively after she, at age 26, became a Goodwill Ambassador for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, later commenting, \"In my early 20s I was fighting with myself. Now I take that punk in me to Washington, and I fight for something important.\" Owing to her extensive activism, her Q Scorethe industry\'s measure of celebrities\' likabilitynearly doubled to 25 between 2000 and 2006. Her recognizability grew accordingly; by 2006, she was familiar to 81% of Americans, compared to 31% in 2000. She became noted for her ability to positively influence her public image through the media, without employing a publicist or an agent. Her Q Score remained above average even when, in 2005, she was accused of ending Brad Pitt\'s marriage to Jennifer Aniston, at which point her public persona became an unlikely combination of alleged homewrecker, mother, sex symbol, and humanitarian.\n\nJolie\'s general influence and wealth are extensively documented. In a 2006 global industry survey by ACNielsen in 42 international markets, Jolie, together with Pitt, was found to be the favorite celebrity endorser for brands and products worldwide. She was the face of St. John and Shiseido from 200608, and in 2011 had an endorsement deal with Louis Vuitton reportedly worth $10 milliona record for a single advertising campaign. Jolie was among the Time 100, a list of the most influential people in the world as published by Time, in 2006 and 2008. She was named the world\'s most powerful celebrity in Forbes\'s Celebrity 100 issue in 2009, and, though ranked lower overall, was listed as the most powerful actress from 200608 and 201113. Forbes additionally cited her as Hollywood\'s highest-paid actress in 2009, 2011, and 2013, with estimated annual earnings of $27 million, $30 million, and $33 million respectively. A 2015 global survey conducted by YouGov in 23 countries, representing nearly two-thirds of the world\'s population, found Jolie to be the most admired woman in the world.\n\nJolie\'s public image is strongly tied to her perceived beauty and sex appeal. Many media outlets, including Vogue, People, and Vanity Fair, have cited her as the world\'s most beautiful woman, while others such as Esquire, FHM, and Empire have named her the sexiest woman alive; both titles have often been based on public polls in which Jolie places far ahead of other celebrity women. Her most recognizable physical features are her many tattoos, eyes, and in particular her full lips, which The New York Times considered as defining a feature as Kirk Douglas\'s chin or Bette Davis\'s eyes. Among her estimated 17 tattoos are the Latin proverb \"quod me nutrit me destruit\" (what nourishes me destroys me), the Tennessee Williams quote \"A prayer for the wild at heart, kept in cages\", a Buddhist Sanskrit prayer of protection, a twelve-inch tiger, and geographical coordinates indicating the birthplaces of her children. Over time, she has covered or lasered several of her tattoos, including \"Billy Bob\", the name of her second husband.\n\n\n\n Jolie at the New York premiere of A Mighty Heart in June 2007; several of her tattoos are visible Professionally, Jolie\'s status as a sex symbol has been considered both an asset and a hindrance. Some of her most commercially successful films, including Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001) and Beowulf (2007), overtly relied at least in part on her sex appeal, with Empire stating that her \"pneumatic figure,\" \"feline eyes,\" and \"bee-stung lips\" have greatly contributed to her appeal to cinema audiences. Conversely, Salon writer Allen Barra agreed with critics who suggested that Jolie\'s \"dark and intense sexuality\" has limited her in the types of roles she can be cast in, rendering her unconvincing in many conventional women\'s roles, while Clint Eastwood, who directed her Oscar-nominated performance in Changeling (2008), opined that having \"the most beautiful face on the planet\" sometimes harmed her dramatic credibility with audiences.\n\nBeyond her career, Jolie\'s appearance has been credited with influencing popular culture at large. In 2002, AfterEllen founder Sarah Warn observed that many women of all sexual orientations had publicly expressed their attraction to Jolie, which she considered a new development in American culture, adding that \"there are many beautiful women in Hollywood, and few generate the same kind of overwhelming interest across genders and sexual orientations that she does.\" Jolie\'s physical attributes became highly sought-after among western women seeking cosmetic surgery; by 2007, she was considered \"the gold standard of beauty,\" with her full lips remaining the most imitated celebrity feature well into the 2010s. After a 2011 repeat survey by Allure found that Jolie most represented the American physical ideal, compared to model Christie Brinkley in 1991, writer Elizabeth Angell credited society with having \"branched out beyond the Barbie-doll ideal and embraced something quite different.\" In 2013, Jeffrey Kluger of Time agreed that Jolie has for many years symbolized the feminine ideal, and opined that her frank discussion of her double mastectomy redefined beauty.','2017-03-25 03:51:12'),(244,32,'2b9b30abeeaca977ad613455c9ab4de49235a536c561d3b736d85079ace7ff89','6f8f9251664842d08a3063afb9fe48d3','','','Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt are said to be expanding their brood of six by adopting a Syrian orphan, according to latest reports.\n\nThe Hollywood actress reportedly met up with three Syrian brothers who were orphaned after their father was taken away by soldiers and their mother killed in a bombing incident.\n\nAngelina and Brad are already parents to six children, three biological including Shiloh, eight, and six-year-old twins Knox and Vivienne, and three adopted, Maddox ,13, from Cambodia, Pax, 11, from Vietnam, and Ethiopian Zahara, 10.\n\nThe 38-year-old actress, who is a UN Special Envoy for Refugee, is said to have wanted to adopt all three children, but it was claimed that she was stopped as Bradallegedly said it would be hard for their children to adjust to the sudden change in familydynamics.\n\nAngie wanted to adopt all three, but when she got back to the United States, and told Brad about it, he said no,\' aRadarOnline source has claimed.\n\nGoing from six children to nine was just way too much, and Brad was concerned about how it would impact their other kids.

Even youthful memories receding into sepia cannot bring me down from the high. Mountains, more than seas, can be exhilarating for the soul. Then I open the newspapers and the downer is as swift as the onset of an Alpine blizzard. Television is even more of a bummer. Last week I saw Piers Morgan tell an American TV personality  a big-time Trump hater  whose face looks exactly like a penis how strange he found it that two people like Bush and Blair, who lied about the war and caused more than a million Iraqi and thousands of American deaths, were hardly vilified for their crimes compared with the stuff being hurled at Trump after only four weeks in the saddle. The penis (Bill Maher) shouted and raved at Piers, who laughed it off.\n\nBut is it a laughing matter? That Bush, Blair and the neocons are walking around free and even telling us how wrong we were to back Brexit? How does Blair dare open his mouth? Mind you, its worse in America, where the FBI, the Justice Department and the intelligence agencies were complicit in a conspiracy to leak the contents of a private conversation in order to bring down the national security adviser and embarrass Trump. They should be prosecuted and exposed, but like Bush and Blair they will not be. This is the deep state, one that is not best pleased with the election results, and one that will play very dirty in cahoots with the lefty media.\n\nLast week my sensei Richard Amos came to visit after a trip to Japan, and we talked about the busted flush that is the regressive EU, and the wonder of Japan. The country has been in a financial crisis for 30 years, yet prices are the same as they were when Richard was there as a 20-year-old going through hell in karate instructors classes that were as tough as anything that special forces have to deal with. Japan has low crime, even lower immigration, a homogeneous population, and always a great respect for the old and the traditional. In other words, the direct opposite of what Europe and the West stand for. More Europe means more immigration and more crime and more alienation.\n\nRichard, now in his early fifties, went back to a class given by an 88-year-old sensei, who smiled, bowed and gingerly attacked him without saying a word. Needless to say, Richard kept him at bay, but respectfully. He visited old dojos, sparred with various old-timers  and some not old at all  dined and drank with them and left with a heavy heart. Japan is probably one of the most pleasant countries to live in. Good manners and respect are the key to a civil society, not inclusion and diversity. I cant wait to return to Tokyo with him this coming autumn and seek out two senseis I want to fight with: Wada San, 68 years old and present champion in the 60-and-over category, and the 88-year-old who attacks without warning. What fun: it will make me feel 75 again.\n\nWe rose early, took our time after breakfast, then hit the dojo. Kicks, punches galore, always looking for a perfect posture and balance. Then we sparred, hard. After that there was lunch in the sun on my terrace. In the afternoon, we went back to the gym, this time for kata training and, of course, kumite, which means fighting. Four hard sessions in two days made me feel like a new man. There is nothing like karate training to make one feel well. Perhaps cross-country skiing comes close, but what do you do when a mugger, or a wise guy, starts trouble? Put on your cross-country skis?\n\nIve installed a makiwara behind my chalet, a makiwara being a wooden stand topped by straw where one hardens ones knuckles and wrists by punching non-stop. There is one for the legs, too, this being my own invention. But back to Japan: it has very little illegal immigration and is officially closed to people seeking blue-collar work. But many Japanese industries are suffering from labour shortages that have helped put a brake on economic growth. Hence some fundamental assumptions about immigrants have had to change. A government-sponsored internship programme allows the mostly Chinese workers to gain skills, the purpose being to square the circle between Japans labour shortage and its ban on low-wage immigration.\n\nOne of the reasons countries such as Japan and Switzerland work as well as they do is that neither country automatically confers citizenship  or rights, for that matter  on anyone who has managed to enter, legally or illegally. One needs to earn the right, otherwise youre out. The fat cats in Brussels havent the guts to declare that there is no free lunch, because having enjoyed only free lunches throughout their life it might make them sound hypocritical.

Just make it illegal to be overweight.\n\nYou might smirk at the idea as unrealistic  but in a world where 500 million people are obese one county has done just that.\n\nPack on the pounds  into the slammer!\n\nIn Japan, lawmakers passed whats now known as the metabo law in 2008.\n\nIt is not a country you normally associate with obesity. In fact, the OECD ranks Japan with only 3% population obesity  one of the least obese developed countries.\n\nCompare this with Australia that has around 60% of Australian adults classified as overweight or obese. More than 25% of these fell into the obese category  thats 3.3 million Australians.\n\nBut a growing concern in Japan over the spiralling health costs of an ageing population  which would only be greater if afflicted by metabolic syndrome  caused the Government to act.\n\nMetabolic syndrome is a combination of such symptoms as problems with cholesterol and triglycerides, high blood pressure and high blood sugar. It is likely to eventually lead to a stroke, heart attack and diabetes.\n\nThe Japanese policy, called Metabo law is, in theory, simple  stay below a government-mandated waistline or face the consequences.\n\nIt is policed through an annual mandatory check up of the waist measurements of 40-75 year-olds  thats over 56 million waistlines, or about 44 percent of the entire population.\n\nBoth local governments and employers require the test.\n\nIn the test both men and women are required to stay under a waist circumference of 33.5 (85cm) and 35.4 (90cm) inches.\n\nThe penalties for failure to comply arent particularly harsh for the individual. They are required to attend a combination of counselling sessions, monitoring through phone and email correspondence, and motivational support.\n\nThere are more repercussions however for business.\n\nEmployers or local government are required to ensure a minimum of 65% participation, with an overall goal to cut the countrys obesity rates by 25% by year 2015. Failure to meet these goals results in fines of almost 10% of current health payments.\n\nCompanies with more than a certain percentage of over-the-waist-limit employees are slapped with a fine.\n\nVictoria Kim writing for PolicyMic.com says that:\n\nNEC, Japans largest maker of personal computers, says its possible to incur as much as $19 million in penalties for failing to meet their targets. Matsushita, which makes Panasonic products, has to measure the waistlines of at least 80% of its employees, along with their families and retirees. The company distributes metabo check towels that double as tape measures to employees to ensure adherence to the waistline limits come time for employees annual checkups.\n\nThe law  dubbed the metabo law comes from the phrase metabolic syndrome. Over the years the buzzword metabo has replaced obesity. It is now a part of the daily lexicon.\n\nIn fact the idea of a fat law seems to be so simple you wonder why other governments dont follow suit. But in practice the law may not be so easy to enforce.\n\nDoctor Hiroyuki Hayashi who runs an anti-metabo clinic. (Jenny Craig anyone?) told the AFP Blogs that the law was a failure.\n\nFor me, its a failure because its not been effective, he said, citing health ministry figures that show of the 52 million or so people aged between 40 and 74 who are meant to undergo annual exams, less than half do so, about 23 million. Out of these people, a little more than four million are beyond the limits, so are given written recommendations. But only 12.3 percent of these people follow through on this medical advice.\n\nDespite these statistics, something is keeping the Japanese slim  whether it is the layout of their cities that encourages walking and movement, the complexities of their diet, or the government intervention.\n\nIt is an irony though that the country so concerned about metabolic syndrome, has the third largest number of per capita cigarette consumption outside Eastern Europe.\n\nYou wonder whether the Government will take similarly tough steps to combat that epidemic?','2017-03-25 03:51:12'),(250,33,'2f5b5902d632ec6743ab234822719bfc63581a39ea5c9bb4999e61537175c049','e963aa86b0c44486ba20e9a0e2c7d104','','','Jika autoplay diaktifkan, video berikutnya yang direkomendasikan akan diputar secara otomatis.','2017-03-25 03:51:12'),(251,33,'2f5b5902d632ec6743ab234822719bfc63581a39ea5c9bb4999e61537175c049','3b76184cc64b4c858eee2472a4d98952','','','Those exceeding government limits  33.5 inches for men and 35.4 inches for women, which are identical to thresholds established in 2005 for Japan by the International Diabetes Federation as an easy guideline for identifying health risks  and having a weight-related ailment will be given dieting guidance if after three months they do not lose weight. If necessary, those people will be steered toward further re-education after six more months.\n\nTo reach its goals of shrinking the overweight population by 10 percent over the next four years and 25 percent over the next seven years, the government will impose financial penalties on companies and local governments that fail to meet specific targets. The countrys Ministry of Health argues that the campaign will keep the spread of diseases like diabetes and strokes in check.\n\nThe ministry also says that curbing widening waistlines will rein in a rapidly aging societys ballooning health care costs, one of the most serious and politically delicate problems facing Japan today. Most Japanese are covered under public health care or through their work. Anger over a plan that would make those 75 and older pay more for health care brought a parliamentary censure motion Wednesday against Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda, the first against a prime minister in the countrys postwar history.\n\nBut critics say that the government guidelines  especially the one about male waistlines  are simply too strict and that more than half of all men will be considered overweight. The effect, they say, will be to encourage overmedication and ultimately raise health care costs.\n\nYoichi Ogushi, a professor at Tokai Universitys School of Medicine near Tokyo and an expert on public health, said that there was no need at all for the Japanese to lose weight.\n\nI dont think the campaign will have any positive effect. Now if you did this in the United States, there would be benefits, since there are many Americans who weigh more than 100 kilograms, or about 220 pounds, Mr. Ogushi said. But the Japanese are so slender that they cant afford to lose weight.\n\nMr. Ogushi was actually a little harder on Americans than they deserved. A survey by the National Center for Health Statistics found that the average waist size for Caucasian American men was 39 inches, a full inch lower than the 40-inch threshold established by the International Diabetes Federation. American women did not fare as well, with an average waist size of 36.5 inches, about two inches above their threshold of 34.6 inches. The differences in thresholds reflected variations in height and body type from Japanese men and women.\n\nComparable figures for the Japanese are sketchy since waistlines have not been measured officially in the past. But private research on thousands of Japanese indicates that the average male waistline falls just below the new government limit.\n\nThat fact, widely reported in the media, has heightened the anxiety in the nations health clinics.\n\nIn Amagasaki, a city in western Japan, officials have moved aggressively to measure waistlines in what the government calls special checkups. The city had to measure at least 65 percent of the 40- to 74-year-olds covered by public health insurance, an extremely difficult goal, acknowledged Midori Noguchi, a city official.\n\nWhen his turn came, Mr. Nogiri, the flower shop owner, entered a booth where he bared his midriff, exposing a flat stomach with barely discernible love handles. A nurse wrapped a tape measure around his waist across his belly button: 33.6 inches, or 0.1 inch over the limit.\n\nStrikeout, he said, defeat spreading across his face.\n\nThe campaign started a couple of years ago when the Health Ministry began beating the drums for a medical condition that few Japanese had ever heard of  metabolic syndrome  a collection of factors that heighten the risk of developing vascular disease and diabetes. Those include abdominal obesity, high blood pressure and high levels of blood glucose and cholesterol. In no time, the scary-sounding condition was popularly shortened to the funny-sounding metabo, and it has become the nations shorthand for overweight.\n\nThe mayor of one town in Mie, a prefecture near here, became so wrapped up in the anti-metabo campaign that he and six other town officials formed a weight-loss group called The Seven Metabo Samurai. That campaign ended abruptly after a 47-year-old member with a 39-inch waistline died of a heart attack while jogging.\n\nStill, at a city gym in Amagasaki recently, dozens of residents  few of whom appeared overweight  danced to the citys anti-metabo song, which warned against trouser buttons popping and flying away, pyun-pyun-pyun!\n\nGoodbye, metabolic. Lets get our checkups together. Go! Go! Go!\n\nGoodbye, metabolic. Dont wait till you get sick. No! No! No!\n\nThe word metabo has made it easier for health care providers to urge their patients to lose weight, said Dr. Yoshikuni Sakamoto, a physician in the employee health insurance union at Matsushita, which makes Panasonic products.\n\nBefore we had to broach the issue with the word obesity, which definitely has a negative image, Dr. Sakamoto said. But metabo sounds much more inclusive.\n\nEven before Tokyos directives, Matsushita had focused on its employees weight during annual checkups. Last summer, Akio Inoue, 30, an engineer carrying 238 pounds on a 5-foot-7 frame, was told by a company doctor to lose weight or take medication for his high blood pressure. After dieting, he was down to 182 pounds, but his waistline was still more than one inch over the state-approved limit.\n\nWith the new law, Matsushita has to measure the waistlines of not only its employees but also of their families and retirees. As part of its intensifying efforts, the company has started giving its employees metabo check towels that double as tape measures.\n\nNobody will want to be singled out as metabo, Kimiko Shigeno, a company nurse, said of the campaign. Itll have the same effect as non-smoking campaigns where smokers are now looked at disapprovingly.\n\nCompanies like Matsushita must measure the waistlines of at least 80 percent of their employees. Furthermore, they must get 10 percent of those deemed metabolic to lose weight by 2012, and 25 percent of them to lose weight by 2015.\n\nNEC, Japans largest maker of personal computers, said that if it failed to meet its targets, it could incur as much as $19 million in penalties. The company has decided to nip metabo in the bud by starting to measure the waistlines of all its employees over 30 years old and by sponsoring metabo education days for the employees families.\n\nSome experts say the governments guidelines on everything from waistlines to blood pressure are so strict that meeting, or exceeding, those targets will be impossible. They say that the governments real goal is to shift health care costs onto the private sector.\n\nDr. Minoru Yamakado, an official at the Japan Society of Ningen Dock, an association of doctors who administer physical exams, said he endorsed the governments campaign and its focus on preventive medicine.\n\nBut he said that the governments real priority should be to reduce smoking rates, which remain among the highest among advanced nations, in large part because of Japans powerful tobacco lobby.\n\nSmoking is even one of the causes of metabolic syndrome, he said. So if youre worried about metabo, stopping people from smoking should be your top priority.\n\nDespite misgivings, though, Japan is pushing ahead.\n\nKizashi Ohama, an official in Matsuyama, a city that has also acted aggressively against metabo, said he would leave the debate over the campaigns merits to experts and health officials in Tokyo.\n\nAt Matsuyamas public health clinic, Kinichiro Ichikawa, 62, said the government-approved 33.5-inch male waistline was severe. He is 5-foot-4, weighs only 134 pounds and knows no one who is overweight.\n\nJapan shouldnt be making such a fuss about this, he said before going off to have his waistline measured.\n\nBut on a shopping strip here, Kenzo Nagata, 73, a toy store owner, said he had ignored a letter summoning him to a so-called special checkup. His waistline was no ones business but his own, he said, though he volunteered that, at 32.7 inches, it fell safely below the limit. He planned to disregard the second notice that the city was scheduled to mail to the recalcitrant.\n\nIm not going, he said.

Japanese legislators introduced this law in 2009, where they specified the maximum waist size. In men, older than 40 years the waist should not exceed 80 cm, in women 90 cm.\n\nThe message claims that it is illegal to be fat in Japan, that the Japanese legislators have introduced this law in 2009, specifying the maximum waist size for men and women older than 40 years. The message is a mixture of hoax and facts as discussed below.\n\nIn 2008 (not 2009 as mentioned in the message), Japanese parliament approved a law saying that it is illegal to be fat in Japan, and this was declared as a war against obesity and also to cut down the government health costs of old age citizens. The Japanese government addressed the growing concern of Metabolic syndrome among its citizens, known here as metabo, which is a combination of health risks including stomach flab, high blood pressure and high cholesterol, that can lead to cardiovascular disease and diabetes. This metabo law of Japan was aimed to save money by reducing health risks related to obesity, especially in old age people. Japan started this ambitious campaign of slimming down its citizens by measuring their waistlines.\n\nAccording to the metabo law, the companies and local governments should measure the waistlines of Japanese people between the age group of 40 to 74, as a part of their annual checkups. To keep a check on obesity and related problems, the law set up a threshold for waistline - 33.5 inches (85 cm) for men and 35.4 inches (90 cm) for women, which is similar to what the International Diabetes Federation set up for Japan in 2005. People exceeding these government limits and having a weight-related problems were given dieting guidance and necessary education. The Japanese government set up targets to decrease their overweight population, and also planned to impose financial penalties on companies and local governments which fail to meet the specified targets.\n\nIn a related news report of CNN shown in the video, Japanese company NEC is facing 19 million dollars penalty if its employees are not slimming down. The company is shown to cater low-calorie diet to its employees, pumping out exercise music twice a day, encouraging them to take stairs and then exercise very often.\n\nYes, it is a fact that there is this \'Metabo\' law in Japan which makes it illegal for the citizens to be obese. Surprisingly, the Japanese, along with the Koreans are the least fat people in the world - according to the World Health Organization. Although Obesity is not a serious problem in Japan, the government sought to such a law to protect the health of its citizens and to cut down their health care costs.\n\nObesity and its related issues are a growing concern in many modern countries, so they can learn something from this Obesity law of Japan.

If more than one of these conditions occur in combination, your risk is even greater.

One current agent declared simply, The FBI is Trumpland. More reports describe a state of internal rebellion inside the FBI, where agents who view Hillary Clinton as the antichrist personified have leaked information to conservative news outlets in an attempt to influence the election. Those leaks led to a bombshell story when Fox News Bret Baier falsely reported that Clinton was likely to be indicted. Though he issued a full apology and retraction on Friday, thousands of voters had already seen the explosive coverage.\n\nMuch of the misbehavior at the FBI can be attributed to Director James Comey, who wrote a letter to Congress 11 days before the election. In that letter, he announced that his bureau was reviewing newly discovered emails that could be pertinent to the probe of Hillary Clinton and her private email server. Though he did not accuse Clinton of any wrongdoing, he unleashed a torrent of negative publicity on her at a crucial point in the campaign. Democrats and Republicans agree that he wrongly interfered in a presidential election:\n\nComey has unleashed a lot of the bad behavior by people down the line by signaling that its okay to treat Hillary Clinton differently, explained Justice Department spokesman Matthew Miller. There certainly seem to be FBI agents who have taken a really hard partisan line and are just kind of blinded by their anger and hatred toward Hillary Clinton. More in-depth reporting about the FBI controversy can be found here, here, and here.\n\nThe alignment of the FBI with Donald Trump is alarming, and not only because it increases the chances of a Trump presidency. Rather, the actions of FBI agents highlight the pro-Trump element within law enforcement in general. To date, the only three major labor unions to endorse Trump all represent law enforcement workers:the Fraternal Order of Police (FOP), the National Border Patrol Council, and National Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Council.\n\nThe politics of law enforcement is revealing, if not terribly shocking. Theboys in blue have spent the better part of two years insisting that their violence is not gratuitous and that their bias is not systematic. They do not deny that their relationship with minorities is strained, but they blame the adversarial tension on the divisive and exaggerated rhetoric of Black Lives Matter, not on their own acts of brutality and murder.\n\nTheir actions tell a different story. By embracing Trump, they publicly subscribe to his theory of law enforcement. Overt racial discrimination is the central pillar of that theory, which is why Trump has pledged to expand stop-and-frisk, to ban Muslim immigration, to surveil mosques, to deport millions of Hispanic immigrants, and to profile citizens using Israels apartheid state as a model. He sees nothing wrong with the absolute levels or racially disparate rates of incarceration and opposes any form of reduced sentencing.\n\nIn branding himself as the law and order candidate, Trump communicates his disdain for Black Lives Matter protests and the social disruptions that are a precondition for racial progress. By threatening to prosecute Hillary Clinton and revoke press passes for journalists who are critical of him, he shows no tolerance for dissent or political opposition. His negative views of civil liberties and open expression prove that he values the maintenance of order at the expense of the pursuit of justice. His rhetoric leaves no doubt that he views African-Americans, Hispanics, and Muslims as predators to be contained.\n\nThe alliance between Trump and law enforcement is anchored by a shared worldview, a worldview in which real Americans live under constant threat from a nebulous and unnamed other or outsider.Minorities have forcefully repudiated this outlook because they correctly perceive an underlying issue of belonging.\n\nRacial conservatives like Donald Trump and the law enforcement officers that have endorsed him still do not fully accept that people of African, Hispanic, or Arab origin are patriotic, that they share American values, and that they are net contributors to society. Rather, theyremain trapped in the mythology of the welfare queen, the superpredator, the airline hijacker.\n\nIn Trumps worldview, minorities are perpetrating a great theft. They rob hard-working Americans at gunpoint in dark alleyways and at the point of food stamp applications in welfare offices. They rob real Americans of the primacy of the English language in Arizona and the Christian religion in Minnesota. They rob them of the racial purity of their college classrooms in Austin, Texas and their elected government in Washington, D.C.\n\nBy endorsing Trump, law enforcement necessarily endorses the worldview he espouses. His message sometimes goes unspoken, but it never goes unheard. Trumps words resonate with an American law enforcement system that has a long history of prosecuting the other.\n\nOne reason why organizations like the FBI are so conservative is because longtime director J. Edgar Hoover recruited staunch anti-communists. However, Hoover and his FBIs crackdown was not limited to communists. They pursued any Americans who deviated from the white male Christian conservative blueprint. They went after pan-Africanists like Marcus Garvey and civil rights leaders like Martin Luther King, Jr. They went after homosexuals and Vietnam War protesters, Black Panthers and environmental activists.\n\nThat history is our past, but also our present. It is very much a part of making America great again. Given the politicization of law enforcement in this election cycle, it is impossible to argue in good faith that the laws of our nation are enforced in a way that is compatible with the interests of minorities. Instead, Americas law enforcement organizations have explicitly linked their mission to Donald Trumps white nationalist vision for the country.\n\nLaw enforcement is an enormously important lever of power in society; it determines right from wrong in the eyes of the state, who gets punished, for what, and for how long. In doing so, it shapes the behavior of citizens and can either be a force for order or justice. A force for order leaves citizens with no recourse when they are mistreated by their government; they are bent into compliance, powerless against structures of oppression and state violence. A force for justice, on the other hand, protects the rights of all citizens, uplifts their voices, and affirms their humanity, even when they make mistakes or challengethe systems morality. Law enforcements present support for Trump reveals that they are far more interested in order than justice, and that is a development that should be deeply disturbing for all Americans.','2017-03-25 03:51:13'),(256,34,'30e469f60f65fb974bffe88eafebd14d18434a9834e3ef8dcbfb630132ecb986','5dc5095680ae4162968be2bf8d2fe128','','','This is a list of notable individuals and organizations who have voiced their endorsement for the office of the president, including those who subsequently retracted or withheld their endorsement, of Donald Trump as the Republican Party\'s presidential nominee for the 2016 U.S. presidential election.\n\nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services\n\nFormer Heads of state and government','2017-03-25 03:51:13'),(257,34,'30e469f60f65fb974bffe88eafebd14d18434a9834e3ef8dcbfb630132ecb986','01c62e7539a54af08f083b30abf1e61e','','','Anthony Miranda, executive chairman of the National Latino Peace Officers Association, seemed a little bewildered last Friday when I told him that America\'s largest police union, the Fraternal Order of Police (FOP), had just given Donald Trump its official blessing.\n\n\"The FOP endorsed Donald Trump?\" he asked.\n\nHe then went on for nearly 15 minutes about why the endorsement was a big mistake. \"There\'s not a need of anybody in the law enforcement community to take a side with someone that\'s going to create a rift in the communities that we\'re serving,\" he said, noting Trump\'s \"antagonistic\" views toward people of color.\n\nTrump\'s rhetoric, Miranda said, has been unhelpful to departments seeking to mend fraught relationships with communities of color.\n\nTrump, who has been heartily embraced by white supremacists and neo-Nazis, has famously called Mexican immigrants \"rapists\" and \"criminals,\" and vowed to bar foreign Muslims from entering the United States. He has posted anti-Semitic memes on Twitter, as well as memes citing false statistics about crimes committed by black Americansagainst whites. In a taped interview that aired on Fox News on Wednesday, he proposed a nationwide stop-and-frisk policy to address crime in black communities. None of these things is helpful to law enforcement at a time when departments are trying to mend fraught relationships with communities of color, Miranda said.\n\nThose relationships have been strained further by three contested police shootings of black citizens in a week. First a teen with a BB gun was shot in Columbus, Ohio. Soon after, videos of Tulsa, Oklahoma, police killing Terrence Crutcher, an unarmed 41-year-old who didn\'t appear to be resisting, garnered national attention. On Wednesday, a protester was shot (by a civilian, authorities say) during a second night of unrest in Charlotte, North Carolina, after police killed Keith Scott, a 43-year-old black man. And dozens of NFL players (not to mention college and high school athletes) have followed the lead of 49ers QB ColinKaepernick, kneeling during the national anthem to protest what they view as police victimization of people of color. (At least two local police unions said their members will stop working security at NFL games if the athletes persist in their activism.)\n\nMiranda, a former NYPD sergeant, pointed out that the FOP only represents its 330,000 membersactive and retired copsbut certainly not all local police departments. The FOP should make that crystal clear, he added, \"so no one else has to bear the wrath of their stupidity.\" (The most recent FBI data, from 2008, put the number of sworn officers employed by local police agencies at around 765,000.)\n\nAccording to an FOP press release, \"Mr. Trump has seriously looked at the issues facing law enforcement today...He understands and supports our priorities and our members believe he will make America safe again.\" In explaining the group\'s decision, FOP officials noted that Hillary Clinton did not seek an endorsement, while Trump had met with members to discuss their concerns. In the 2012 race, the group declined to back either Barack Obama or Mitt Romney.\n\nSeveral of Trump\'s most ardent police supporters have fraught histories with communities of color. Milwaukee Sheriff David Clarke Jr., who endorsed Trump at the Republican National Convention in July, declared that \"Black Lives Matter is the enemy\" following the shootings of police officers in Dallas and Baton Rouge. Another Trump backer, Arizona sheriff Joe Arpaio, unapologetically backs the racial profiling of Latinosbecause some may be in the country illegally.\n\n\"We have worked with both of the campaigns to suggest that the crime data is not as gloom and doom as some might believe.\"\n\nAdeel Rana, president of the NYPD\'s Muslim Officers Society, America\'s largest organization of Muslim cops, also criticized Trump and his endorsement by the FOP. He was particularly irked, he told me, by Trump\'s targeting of entire groups of people. \"It\'s against the Constitution.

Sometimes, however, confusion can arise when two or more flags closely resemble each other. Here are nine sets of flags that exhibit varying degrees of similarity.\n\nNone of the worlds national flags are as closely matched to each other as these two. Their design and size are almost identical, and only a close examination reveals slight shade differences between the blue, yellow, and red vertical stripes. The two came from totally different backgrounds. The Romanian flag dates from 1861, based on earlier versions with horizontal stripes. The flag of Chad was first hoisted in 1959 after the country had achieved independence from France. Its original design had a green stripe, but it too closely resembled the flag of Mali, so the blue stripe was substituted. Andorra has a similar flag as well, but it is distinguished by its centrally placed coat of arms. None of the worlds national flags are as closely matched to each other as these two.

However, they differ in several ways: the design of the constellation (five white seven-pointed stars for Australia, four red-and-white five-pointed stars for New Zealand); the addition of a sixth, larger, commonwealth star on the Australian flag; and shade differences in the blues and reds. Nonetheless, the design similarities are one of the reasons why New Zealanders have considered replacing their flag.

Although that country dissolved in 1830, the succeeding states of Colombia, Ecuador, and Venezuela incorporated that flags tricolor design into their respective flags. Those of Columbia and Ecuador retain the larger yellow stripe, while that of Venezuela has stripes of equal size. The Venezuelan flag is also distinguished by an arc of stars in its center and by the national coat of arms in the upper hoist corner.

This flag became the inspiration for the vertically striped French Tricolor after the French Revolution in 1789. Although Luxembourg lies close to the Netherlands, its flag was not derived from the Dutch flag but was developed independently.

The two flags most closely resembling the Russian standard are those of Slovakia and Slovenia, which differ mainly in being longer than the Russian flag and incorporating their respective countrys coat of arms into the flag design.

Indonesia has won 27 medals, including 6 golds, they are a dominant badminton nation and have won a medal in every summer games since their first medal, a silver in womans team archery, during Seoul 1988. Monaco has never won an official medal at any Olympic , despite competing in XX games. They did win a bronze in architecture during the 1924 (Paris) art competition, but the IOC doesnt count these. I believe, but cannot confirm, their best result was a 12th place finish in gymnastics during the 1920 games in Antwerp, Belgium. Singapore has won 4 medals (no gold) 3 of which have came in table tennis. However, at the most recent Commonwealth games in Glasgow, Scotland Singapore won 17 medals (8 gold).\n\nFun Flag Facts!There is a variant Polish flag with the coat of arms centered in the white top half of the flag, although it is not legally restricted (as it once was), it is only supposed to be flown in an official capacity.Legend has it the Indonesia flag was created at the end of World War 2 when Indonesian nationals forced their way into a Dutch government building and tore the blue strip from the flag of the Netherlands. I dont know if this is true, but I want to believe and shall consider it a fact simply because its an awesome story. Monaco is the first historical example of a protectorate, during the era of the Spanish Protectorate (early 16th century) the Lords of Monaco upgrade their title to prince. In 1641 the protectorate was transferred to France. Prince Albert, of Monaco, also has a kicking banner. Singapores crescent was originally a symbol to the Malays that they would not side with China, their flag was meant to have three stars but someone decided it looked too communist-y.\n\nHow do youtell them apart?

According to the Nagarakretagama(Desawarana) written in 1365, Majapahit was an empire of 98 tributaries, stretching from Sumatra to New Guinea;\n\nconsisting of present-day Indonesia, Singapore, Malaysia, Brunei, southern Thailand, Sulu Archipelago, Philippines, and East Timor, although the true nature of Majapahit sphere of influence is still the subject of studies among historians.\n\nMajapahit was one of the last major empires of the region and is considered to be one of the greatest and most powerful empires in the history of Indonesia and Southeast Asia, one that is sometimes seen as the precedent for Indonesia\'s modern boundaries.\n\nIts influence extended beyond the modern territory of Indonesia and has been the subject of many studies.\n\nHow it is like living in Majapahit era?\n\nIts Temple (Its not build in Majapahit era but still used that time).','2017-03-25 03:51:13'),(274,37,'316eeebfe69cc0f11105a2057ecf74effa5e62c19bf3de799dcbc58d10aed8c4','d845542910e14e02b1c9aba0a2839117','','','No ones disputing that a pair of characters draped in Ku Klux Klan garb and carrying pro-Donald Trump signs showed up at a Nevada caucus location Tuesday night  but the question of the moment is, Who are they?\n\nAnd particularly  whats the color of their skin?\n\nA number of photos were snapped of the supposed KKK representatives outside Cimarron High School \n\n but some observers said the individuals in question were black and pointed to their hands.\n\nKevin Smith posted this photo and said he saw the pair up close.

On August 26th, the Bloomberg Television anchor John Heilemann brought up David Duke, the former Klan Grand Wizard, who had said that Trump was the best of the lot in the 2016 campaign. Trump replied that he had no idea who Duke was. Heilemann asked if Trump would repudiate Dukes endorsement. Sure, Trump said, if that would make you feel better, I would certainly repudiate. I dont know anything about him. Changing tack, Heilemann pressed Trump about an article in this magazine, which described Trumps broad support among neo-Nazis, white nationalists, and other members of the far right who were drawn in by his comments about Mexicans. Trump maintained a posture of indifference. Honestly, John, Id have to read the story. A lot of people like me. The interview moved on to other topics.\n\nIt should be noted that Trumps unfamiliarity with Duke is a recent condition. In 2000, Trump issued a statement that he was no longer considering a run for President with the backing of the Reform Party, partly because it now includes a Klansman, Mr. Duke.\n\nThroughout last fall and into the winter, Trump continued to accumulate support among white nationalists. In November, on a weekend in which he said that a black protester, at a rally in Alabama, deserved to be roughed up, Trump retweeted a graphic composed of false racist statistics on crime; the graphic, it was discovered, originated from a neo-Nazi account that used as its profile image a variation on the swastika. In January, he retweeted the account @WhiteGenocideTM, which identified its location as Jewmerica. Shortly before the Iowa caucuses, a pro-Trump robocall featured several white supremacists, including the author Jared Taylor, who told voters, We dont need Muslims. We need smart, well-educated white people. Each time Trump was asked on Twitter about his white nationalist supporters, the candidate, who is ready to respond, day or night, to critics of his debating style or his golf courses, simply ignored the question.\n\nOnly under special circumstances did Trump summon a forceful response on matters of the Klan: in January, BoingBoing unearthed a newspaper report from 1927 on the arraignment of a man with the name and address of Donald Trumps father; the story was about attendees of a Klan rally who fought with police, though it wasnt clear from the story why the Trump in the piece was arrested. Asked about it, Donald Trump denied that his father had had any connection to a Klan rally. Its a completely false, ridiculous story. He was never there! It never happened. Never took place.\n\nBut recently, as Trumps campaign has received much belated closer scrutiny, his reliable approach to the Klan problem has faltered. On Thursday, Duke offered his strongest support for the candidate yet, telling radio listeners that a vote for one of Trumps rivals would be treason to your heritage. The next day, when Trump had hoped to focus on his endorsement by Governor Chris Christie, of New Jersey, a reporter shouted a question about Dukes embrace, and Trump said, David Duke endorsed me? O.K., all right, I disavow. O.K.? For the moment, it worked, and the press conference moved on. Christie, in fact, bore the brunt of the Duke association: he appeared on the front page of the Daily News on Saturday, as the MAN WITH A KLAN, with his picture beside a group of hooded Klansmen. In a different spirit, the Daily Stormer, a neo-Nazi news site that long ago endorsed Trump, awarded Christie the title Heroic Deputy. (Christies overnight evolution from trashing Trump to obeying him repulsed even the political class, a group that is usually more forgiving of self-rationalization. The technology executive Meg Whitman, who had been one of Christies top backers, called his alliance with Trump an astonishing display of political opportunism, and asked Christies donors and supporters to reject the governor and Donald Trump outright.)\n\nOver the weekend, Trumps purported indifference to support from white supremacists and fascists became an inescapable problem. He had retweeted a Mussolini quote from @ilduce2016 (which, it turned out, was an account created by Gawker to trap Trump)It is better to live one day as a lion than 100 years as a sheepand, when asked, on NBC, if he wanted to associate himself with Mussolini, he said that he wanted to be associated with interesting quotes. He added, Mussolini was Mussolini. . . . What difference does it make? On CNN, Jake Tapper pressed him about David Duke, and Trump, seeming to forget that he had given a one-line disavowal, reverted to a position of theatrical incomprehension: Just so you understand, I dont know anything about David Duke, O.K.? Tapper asked three times if Trump would denounce the Klans support, and each time Trump declined. I dont know anything about what youre even talking about with white supremacy or white supremacists, he said. So I dont know. I dont knowdid he endorse me, or whats going on? Because I know nothing about David Duke; I know nothing about white supremacists.\n\nBy Monday, less than twenty-four hours before primary voting on Super Tuesday, his non-answers about the Klan were creating a crisis, and Trump introduced a new explanation: audio trouble. Im sitting in a house in Florida with a very bad earpiece that they gave me, and you could hardly hear what he was saying, he said on the Today show. But what I heard was various groups, and I dont mind disavowing anybody, and I disavowed David Duke and I disavowed him the day before at a major news conference, which is surprising because he was at the major news conference, CNN was at the major news conference, and they heard me very easily disavow David Duke.\n\nThere may be no better measure of the depravity of this campaign season than the realizationthat its not clear whether Trumps overt appreciation for fascism, and his sustained salute to American racists, will have a positive or negative effect on his campaign. For now, his opponents are rejoicing. Marco Rubio, the Florida senator, pronounced him unelectable. Governor John Kasich, of Ohio, called Trumps comments just horrific. But it is by now a truism to note that Trump has survived pratfalls that other politicians have not. A surprisingly large portion of Americans believed him when he pushed a racist campaign denying the birthplace of Barack Obama; a comparably chilling portion of Americans were attracted when he called Mexicans rapists. By the end of the day on Sunday, he had received the endorsement of Senator Jeff Sessions, of Alabama, the first sitting senator officially to line up with Trump. Sessions was not likely to be bothered by Trumps flirtations with the Klan. In 1986, he was rejected from a federal judgeship after saying that he thought the Klan was O.K. until I learned they smoked pot.\n\nIn the weeks to come, Trump is virtually guaranteed to accumulate additional endorsements from politicians like Christie and Sessions, who have divined their interests in drafting behind the strongest candidate for the Republican nomination. Whether driven by fear of irrelevance or attracted by the special benefits of being an early adopter, Christie seemed compelled to do it, and now the remnant of his political reputation is going from a solid to a gas. But the true obscenity of his decision, and those of other Trumpists, may take years to be fully appreciated. In an editorial last week, the Washington Post declared that history will not look kindly on GOP leaders who fail to do everything in their power to prevent a bullying demagogue from becoming their standard-bearer. Thats true, but history will judge even more harshly those who stand with Trump now that it is indefensibly clear with whom they are standing.','2017-03-25 03:51:13'),(279,37,'316eeebfe69cc0f11105a2057ecf74effa5e62c19bf3de799dcbc58d10aed8c4','7f126612b5bc40de99e1769fc6a67e40','','','Hodgetwins On Tour Buy tickets at: http://hodgetwinstour.com \n\nWatch Previous Video: Kim Kardashian robbed! https://youtu.be/hnhKKPtlycE\n\n\n\nHodgetwins Social Media Links:\n\nTumblr: http://bit.ly/hodgetwinstumblr\n\nSnapchat http://bit.ly/snapchathodgetwins\n\nTwitter: http://bit.ly/twitterhodgetwins\n\nInstagram: http://bit.ly/IGhodgetwins\n\n\n\nSUPPORT THE HODGETWINS BY SHOPPING AT: \n\nhttp://officialhodgetwins.com/\n\n\n\nCLICK TO SUBSCRIBE TO HODGETWINS CHANNEL\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/hodgetwi...\n\n\n\nLINKS TO Hodgetwins Youtube Channels:\n\nTwinmuscle: http://www.youtube.com/twinmuscleworkout\n\nHodgetwins: http://www.youtube.com/hodgetwins\n\nAskhodgetwins: http://www.youtube.com/askhodgetwins\n\nHodgetwins Vlogs: http://www.youtube.com/fastingtwins\n\n\n\nWelcome to the Hodgetwins we discuss breaking news and current events reported from traditional TV news outlets as well as digital global news networks which are the largest online news shows in the world.

Jackson employs actors to stage photographs showing celebrities in compromising positions, and her book also featured images of a fake Trump attacking a gun range target with Hillary Clintons face posted atop it, having sex with a beauty pageant contestant, and receiving a full-body spray tan:\n\nAlison Jackson is renown for her explorations into how photography and the cult of the celebrity have transformed our relationship to what is real. Her notorious photographic portraits, life-like sculptures, films and videos are startlingly realistically staged affairs that cast uncannily styled actors into an entirely fathomable projection of a future that could have been; or the intimate, often salacious, imagined private moments of media icons such as Diana Princess of Wales, the Queen of England, Marilyn Monroe, George Bush, Brad and Angelina, and David Beckham. Jacksons productions stress-test the implicit belief that a photograph can capture a frozen moment of truth. At best, a photograph of a celebrity reproduces something authentic only at the very moment the shutter clicks says the artist yet we have been teased into giving these moments an absolute and unquestioned authority. However, what we actually do is create a narcissistic circle where we assert our control over the object of desire: we transform our celebrities into what we want. This whole projective process is further exaggerated by our capacity for fantasy and the inherently titillating nature of the image of a celebrity like Marilyn in flagrante. In this way, my productions, charged with desire, have become more real than the real life model they are based on, evolving into a mental image rather than a direct record of reality\n\nJackson has created staged photographs involving several other presidents, including George W. Bush and John F. Kennedy.

Him being from the same walk of life [as us], thats another story, said Robert McCarthy, 53, a Trump voter from Broad Channel, one of the few Queens neighborhoods the president-elect won in November.\n\nI dont think he even knows what Broad Channel is.\n\nOverall, Trump received 21.6 percentof the boroughs vote, compared with 17.9 percentof votes citywide, according to the citys Board of Elections.\n\nIn Jackson Heights, the Queens neighborhood where Trump had the fewest number of votes, many residents agreed.\n\nI think him losing [the neighborhood] affects his ego a bit, but it wont matter. Hes not thinking about our needs, said Donna Edwards, 35, a physician who voted for Hillary Clinton.\n\nIn fact, borough residents said they never really felt that Trump was proud to be from Queens.\n\nBorn in Jamaica Estates in 1946, he attended the private Kew Forest School before transferring to an upstate military school for most of his teenage years. Shortly after graduating from Wharton Business School at the University of Pennsylvania, Trump made enough money working in his dads real estate business to move to a luxury apartment in Manhattan, which he relished, according to his book The Art of the Deal.\n\nI was a kid from Queens who worked in Brooklyn, and suddenly I had an apartment on the Upper East Side. I became a city guy instead of a kid from the boroughs, he wrote.\n\nRepresentatives for the president-elect didnt return several calls requesting comment.\n\nIn the coastal Queens neighborhoods of Howard Beach, Broad Channel and the Rockaways, where Trump had the strongest showing with 18,768 votes, residents said Trumps apparent lack of love of his home borough didnt affect their decision at the polls.\n\nThey expressed a sense of being neglected by elected officials when it came to quality-of-life issues such as better public transit, Superstorm Sandy-related home repairs, or even snow removal. Trump, in their view, had an outsider perspective and had just as much disdain for the political machine as they did.\n\nHes always touring the country and listening to the working class, so I hope he does what he can to help, said Lorraine MacCloud, a Broad Channel resident of 41 years who voted for him.\n\nStill, some Trump voters admitted said it wasnt a slam dunk decision to choose Trump over Clinton.\n\nI wish we had someone else to choose from, McCarthy said.\n\nVoters in Jackson Heights and East Elmhurst, where Trump only had 5,071 votes, a fifth of Clintons total in the district, said they could see major distinctions between the two candidates, especially when it came to immigration. Nearly 63 percentof the areas population was born outside of the United States, according to the latest census data, and voters there said they couldnt take any threat of deportation or racial bias lightly.\n\nWe wont know what is going to happen until he actually gets into office, said David Rafanan, 22, a Clinton voter whose family moved from the Philippines to East Elmhurst.

Family and friends could also suffer under Trumps unorthodox approach to foreign policy and tough stance on Islam, he said.\n\nThe world is a big place and I dont know if he understands all of our needs and the [intricacies] of dealing with other countries, said Chowdhary, who runs a moving company.\n\nMoving forward, the Queens voters on both sides said they plan on making their voices heard and keeping the new president in check by reminding him that he was one of them.\n\nWeve got to give him a chance, because hes not going anywhere, said Edward Frank, 47, a MTA bus driver from Howard Beach who voted for Clinton.

On that day a business tycoon, reality TV celebrity and architect of one of the most divisive and incendiary campaigns in memory  a campaign that has raised comparisons to Hitler and Mussolini  will become the most powerful person on the planet, his finger on the nuclear trigger.\n\nThis is no ordinary candidate in no ordinary year. Trump will be the first person in more than 60 years to enter the White House with no experience as a governor or on Capitol Hill. Many words have been used by critics to describe him: bigot, blowhard, demagogue, idiot, misogynist, narcissist, racist, sexual predator. Tony Schwartz, who ghost-wrote Trumps bestselling book The Art of the Deal, said if he was writing it now, he would call it The Sociopath.\n\nTrump is the blue-collar billionaire who lives the high life of golf and private jets but appeals to those who feel dispossessed and believe the American dream is dead. He launched his campaign in June 2015 with a tirade against immigrants  he branded Mexicans criminals and rapists  although he himself is descended from them. His mother, Mary MacLeod, was from Stornoway in the Outer Hebrides, once described by Trump as serious Scotland. His father, Fred, was the son of Friedrich Trump, who at 16 arrived on a boat in lower Manhattan in 1885, learned English and became a US citizen.\n\nSetting up home in Queens, New York, Fred Trump built a property empire and became one of the citys biggest developers and landlords. Donald Trump was born there on 14 June 1946, the fourth of five children.\n\nOn Sundays the family worshipped at Marble Collegiate church in Manhattan, where the head pastor was Norman Vincent Peale, dubbed Gods salesman and author of The Power Of Positive Thinking. That book influenced the young Trump with advice such as: Formulate and stamp indelibly on your mind a mental picture of yourself as succeeding. Hold this picture tenaciously. Never permit it to fade. Your mind will seek to develop the picture  Do not build up obstacles in your imagination.\n\nTrump had a rebellious streak and, aged 13, his parents sent him to the New York Military Academy in hope of instilling discipline. It worked. He thrived on the competition over everything from tidying his room to shining his shoes and climbed the ranks. Through five educational and medical deferments during the Vietnam war, Trump would never serve in the US military, but he claimed that the school gave him more training militarily than a lot of the guys that go into the military.\n\nTrump went on to Fordham University, then the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, graduating with a degree in economics in 1968. He joined his fathers business, helping manage residential housing projects for the middle class in New York boroughs Brooklyn and Queens, and became favourite to succeed him after his elder brother, a pilot, died at 43 due to alcoholism. It was a tragedy that Trump said led him to avoid alcohol, cigarettes and drugs all his life.\n\nTrump took control of the company in 1971, renaming it the Trump Organization, and claimed his father gave him a small loan of a million dollars to help. The firm expanded into Manhattan, transforming the rundown Commodore Hotel into the Grand Hyatt and erecting the 58-storey Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue, which serves as both his primary residence and the headquarters of the Trump Organization. In 1973 the Trumps were charged with racial bias in their rental practices before reaching a settlement with the US government.\n\nOther properties bearing his name followed, including golf courses, the Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, New Yorks venerable Plaza Hotel and casinos. Around the world there were Trump Towers in Mumbai, Istanbul and the Philippines.\n\nBut Trumps business record  crucial to his election message  is chequered. Setbacks included Trump University, Trump Mortgage, Trump Airlines and Trump Vodka as well as four casinos in Atlantic City, New Jersey.\n\nDespite piling up a vast fortune over the years, Trump has seen his companies file at least four bankruptcies. During the second presidential debate, Trump admitted using a $916m loss claimed in 1995 to avoid paying federal income tax for many years. According to Forbes, Trumps net worth is $3.7bn, although he has repeatedly claimed he is worth $10bn.\n\nTrump also moved into the entertainment industry, owning the Miss Universe, Miss USA and Miss Teen USA beauty pageants from 1996 to 2015. In 2003, his celebrity soared with The Apprentice, the TV show in which contestants battled for a shot at a management job within his organisation and he could say with relish, Youre fired! He claimed in a financial disclosure form that he was paid a total of $213m by NBC.\n\nBut as far-fetched as it seems, Trumps hostile takeover of the political scene is not entirely unexpected. Once a registered Democrat and donor to the party, he reportedly expressed an interest in running for president as early as 1987 and entered the 2000 race as a Reform party candidate. He also led the birther movement after repeatedly questioning the birthplace of Barack Obama. He finally conceded this year that the US president was born in Hawaii but offered no apology, fuelling the allegation that he had run a racially charged, white nativist campaign.\n\nLast December, in a speech following the deaths of 14 people in a terrorist shooting attack in San Bernardino, California, he said: Donald J Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our countrys representatives can figure out what the hell is going on. The pledge was later altered to cover people from regions that export terrorism.\n\nYet his dark vision of America, and his promise to make it great again, resonated with swaths of the country, especially white men who felt themselves economically and culturally in retreat. He defeated 16 rivals in the Republican primary, including Jeb Bush, the son and brother of past presidents, and arch-conservative Ted Cruz, with a record number of votes.\n\nHis rallies were like rock star events  he called his campaign a movement  even as he hurled insults and trampled over numerous political norms and values. Not even a 2005 video in which he boasted about groping women, and subsequent allegations of harassment from a dozen women, could derail him. I have great respect for women, he improbably asserted. Nobody has more respect for women than I do.\n\nHis private life is far from conventional for a president. His first marriage to Czech athlete and model Ivana Zelnkov ended in divorce in 1990. The couple had three children, Donald Jr, Ivanka and Eric, all of whom have become prominent surrogates on the trail. In a 2006 interview on The View, Trump said: If Ivanka werent my daughter, perhaps Id be dating her.\n\nHe married actor Marla Maples in 1993 before they separated in 1997 and divorced in 1999; they have one daughter, Tiffany. The billionaire began dating his third wife, Slovenian-born model Melania Knauss, in 1998. The pair married in 2005  the Clintons were among the guests  and a year later their son, Barron, was born.\n\nTrump once said his supporters were so loyal that he could shoot someone on Fifth Avenue in New York and not lose a single vote. It more or less proved to be true.','2017-03-25 03:51:13'),(285,38,'326c1dc3d0cfd09759de03ec368c6fc5d8f40a309c6109d2852738a88653511f','1a67d8628c0d4ccbb8b3dc672ae80f2a','','','I know, it seems outrageous,\n\nBut its getting a lot of attention\n\nOn some very respectable Web pages \n\nDonald Trump was not born in Queens,\n\nHe was born in the Philippines,\n\nHis mom and dad were Celanese\n\nAnd left him with Franciscan nuns\n\nAt the age of 14 months.\n\nAdopted on the third of June\n\nWho took the little boy away\n\nTo a mansion in the USA\n\nAnd naturalized him more or less.\n\nThe record of his nativity\n\nIs kept under lock and key\n\nWith his tax returns, the MRIs\n\nIt comes from folks who ought to know.\n\nA week ago, a panhandler in Times Square sat holding a sign reading, Give me a dollar or Ill vote for Trump, and people laughed and reached into their pockets.

Millions of Americans are planning to cast their votes for a man who has lived his life contrary to all of their most cherished values. They are respectful, honest, generous, loyal, modest, church-going people with no Mafia connections and good credit records who try not to spout off about things they know nothing about.\n\n[Charles Lane: Why the media blitz on Trump isnt working]\n\nHis followers out on the prairie were brought up to be wary of slick-talking New Yorkers but here they are, falling right into line behind the biggest braggart ever to hit the sawdust trail. Its going to be an education for them, watching him cut taxes while expanding the military and building a wall and deporting 11 million people. In America, you cant send gendarmes through the streets to round up people in trucks and load them on boxcars and ship them away. There is a judicial process. Lawyers are involved. People have certain rights.\n\nHis boast after the Manhattan pressure-cooker bombing Saturday night was revelatory. I called it! he cried on Fox News, as he had after the Orlando nightclub shooting. It wouldve been classier for him to have congratulated New Yorks Finest but instead he took it as a personal coup.\n\nWhat the bombing showed was the courage and smarts of the NYPD, arriving on the scene in time to defuse a second bomb, identify a suspect and track him down Monday morning. Weve got to be very, very tough, cried the candidate out in Colorado, but back in New York, the work was being done by people who know how to do it.\n\nAh, chutzpah! There was once a mayor of New York who overruled the NYPD and the Secret Service and put the citys Emergency Command Center on the 23rd floor of the World Trade Center, and whose emergency plan for the towers led to massive confusion and miscommunication, with some desperate people directed to climb up and others told to stay put, as the mayor stood in the streets below and urged residents to be calm, and thereby became a national hero and started his own security consulting company. This is like the captain of the Titanic, had he survived, writing a book called The Art of Navigation. The mayor is now a close Trump adviser.\n\n[Greg Sargent: Clinton campaign prods media to hold Trump accountable for his debate lies]\n\nTrump is a man whom few Republicans would care to invite into their homes.

He was the fourth of five children in the Trump family.\n\nAt the age of 17 Trump attended the New York Military Academy, aprivate boarding school in rural New York state. He has said his time there was \"five of my betteryears in life\".\n\nHe graduatedfrom the University of Pennsylvania\'s Wharton School of Finance and Commerce in 1968. The school includeshim onits 125Influential People and Ideas list saying it would be\"difficult to find a more ubiquitous public business figure of the late 20th and early 21st Centuries\".\n\nHe got a \"small\" loan of $1m from his father as a start in business and he has said his father advised him against venturing into real estate in Manhattan, away from the family\'s projects in Queens and Brooklyn.\n\nIn 1974Trump became president of his father\'s business, which later became The Trump Organization.\n\nIn 1976Trump bought the Commodore Hotel in Manhattan with the Hyatt Organization. The hotel would become the Grand Hyatt. Trump negotiateda 40-year tax break, which has reportedly cost New York City $360m to date.\n\nIn 1977Trump marriedIvana Zelnckov, a model originally from Czechoslovakia. They have three children together; DonaldJr,Ivankaand Eric. Theydivorced in 1992.\n\nTrump Tower on Fifth Avenue in New York City was completed in 1979.\n\nIn 1987Trump published his first book, \'The Art of the Deal\', an autobiographical account of his personal success, in which he talks about thinking big:\n\nAlso in 1987he setup The Donald JTrump Foundation for charitable giving with the original purpose ofgiving away personal proceeds from his book. It operatesfrom Trump\'s business office in New York. Trump says he has given millions of dollars to charity in recent years but doubts have been cast over this claim.\n\nTrump first filed for bankruptcy in 1991 for the Trump Taj Mahal casino in Atlantic City, New Jersey. Then in 1992 he filed for bankruptcy for Trump Castle, Trump Plaza and Casino, also in Atlantic City, and the Plaza Hotel in Manhattan.\n\nAfter a high-profile relationship Trump married actress Marla Maples in 1993. They have a daughter, Tiffany. The couple divorced in 1999.\n\nTrump bought the Miss Universe Organization in 1996, which he held onto until 2015.\n\nIn 1999 Trump\'s father Fred died. Trump has said his father was his greatest influence in his life.\n\nIn 2000 Trump enteredthe presidential race as a Reform Party candidate. It was not the first time that he had considered a run for the presidency;in 1987 he had considered running but due to financial issues withthe Taj Mahal he did not pursue it further.\n\nBankruptcy number five came in 2004, again with Trump Hotels and Casinos Resorts.\n\nAlso in 2004 the property developerstarted hosting the reality show \'The Apprentice\' followed by \'The Celebrity Apprentice\'.\n\nThe programme has run for 14 seasons on NBC. The 15th season of The Celebrity Apprentice is set to be hosted by former California governor and actor Arnold Schwarzenegger.\n\nIn 2005 Trump married Melania Knauss, a model originally from Yugoslavia. They have one son, Baron, born in 2006.\n\nTrump Entertainment Resorts -formerly Trump Hotels and Casinos Resorts - was hit hard by the 2008 economic recession and Trump declared his sixth bankruptcyin 2009.\n\nHe resigned as the companys chairman and reduced his stake in the companyto 10%. The company continued to use Trumps name in licensing.\n\nTrump owns hotels and casinos in the US, Canada, and Central and South America, as well as golf coursesthroughout the world. He also ownsTrump International Golf Links and Hotel in Doonbegin Co Clare. He has real estate throughout the world including Turkey, South Korea andthe Philippines and he operates a winery among other businesses.\n\nHe says he is worth $10bn, but Forbes magazine says he is worth $3.7bn.\n\nOn 16 June 2015 Trump launched his bid for the White House.\n\nOn 8 November 2016, with wins in a number of key battleground states, Donald Trump defeated Hillary Clinton in the race to become US president.\n\nToday,Donald Trump is to besworn in as the 45th president of the US -capping his improbable journey to the White House.','2017-03-25 03:51:13'),(287,38,'326c1dc3d0cfd09759de03ec368c6fc5d8f40a309c6109d2852738a88653511f','198703d62bed4518bee9219a48eff1d7','','','Trump faces the contradiction that has dominated his business life: the gulf between his reported wealth and its rumoured reality. Trump ran for president saying that hed be his own man because he didnt need other peoples money to win: Im rich, he boasted. Really rich. But while the campaign is overwhelmingly self-financed, he has welcomed and received millions of dollars in donations, too.And the money that he himself has put into the campaign has come with strings attached. Some of it is a loan that he can, in theory, later recover. And just as Trump has said Americans should buy American goods, so the Trump has purchased many of his campaign services from himself  recycling his money rather than actually spending it. The campaign uses Trump Tower as its headquarters, flies Trump airplanes and serves Trump-branded water and wine. It has spent $65,000 on the use of Trump golf courses and $423,000 using the Mar-a-Lago resort.\n\nAs the primaries came to an end, it emerged that Trump was running low on cash. Now he has to rely upon the help of the Republican Party to keep afloat, one of the great ironies of this election. The man who has done more than anyone to question the abilities and economic nous of the Republican establishment can only win with their generosity. And if hes going to win the presidency, say the pundits, he really has to build bridges with the mainstream. One thing that regular conservatives are looking for in his vice-presidential pick is someone who proves that he is serious about working with Washington  a pick that broadens his appeal rather than confirms his taste for maverick theatrics.\n\nBut dont be surprised if Trump takes the Republicans money and then campaigns on his own terms. Why wouldnt he? He has so far defied the rules of American politics and has succeeded because, for all his many flaws, his instincts are far closer to those of the average American than his rivals can match. Ultimately, Trump has won votes for the same reason that hes been a success in business. The sales pitch has been smart and many people rather like the product.','2017-03-25 03:51:13'),(288,38,'326c1dc3d0cfd09759de03ec368c6fc5d8f40a309c6109d2852738a88653511f','8450329b8e4647049e4167f2873567c7','','','Since 2011, Donald Trump has been perpetuating the lie that Barack Obama was born outside the United States. Trump became a leader of the so-called \"birther\" movement in order to promote himself as a potential presidential candidate, exploiting the racism and paranoia of many Americans who are now supporting his campaign. Trump\'s \"birther\" efforts were designed to question the legitimacy of America\'s first black president. Even after Obama released his birth certificate from Hawaii -- something no other president has ever felt compelled to do -- Trump continued to play the \"birther\" card.\n\nAfter spinning this lie for many years, last week Trump reluctantly acknowledged that Obama was born in the United States, although he refused to admit that he had been lying about this for years and refused to apologize to Obama.\n\nDespite his turnaound, Trump can\'t take back the damage he\'s done by repeating the falsehood to bolster his political ascendancy.\n\nThe \"birther\" lie confirms the harsh truth often attributed to Joseph Goebbels, Hitler\'s propaganda chief: \"If you tell a lie big enough and keep repeating it, people will eventually come to believe it.\" A new NBC News poll conducted in June and July found that 72 percent of registered Republican voters still doubt President Obama\'s place of birth. And 41 percent outright disagreed with the statement, \"Barack Obama was born in the United States.\"\n\nEarlier this week, 51 percent of voters who back Trump said Obama was not born in the U.S., according to a YouGov/Economist poll. Overall, 71 percent of all adults correctly believe that Obama was born in America.\n\nBy forcing the media to ask questions about Obama\'s birthplace, Trump has cleverly deflected attention away from his own ancestry and origins. At no point during this campaign has a reporter asked Trump where he was born or to prove his citizenship with official documents.\n\nAfter an exhaustive investigation, I have discovered evidence that Trump does not want the country to see. I have learned the location of Trump\'s birth.\n\nHe was born on third base.\n\nIn popular parlance, \"born on third base\" means that someone was born to privilege. Many people who were born on third base acknowledge that it provided them with significant advantages throughout their lives. But Trump -- like some other heirs to big fortunes -- refuses to discuss his birthplace. Is he ashamed of his origins? Or does he fail to realize that Fred Trump, a wealthy developer, was not only his father but also his manager and third base coach.\n\nIt\'s rich people like Trump that led football coach Barry Switzer to quip: \"Some people are born on third base and go through life thinking they hit a triple.\" At the 1988 Democratic convention, former Texas Agriculture Commissioner Jim Hightower used that line to excoriate George H.W. Bush, whose father was a wealthy Yale graduate and one-time U.S. Senator. Now Chuck Collins, great-grandson of meatpacker Oscar Mayer, has written a book, Born on Third Base, explaining why people like Trump are able to fool themselves -- and perhaps others -- into believing that their success was due entirely to their own hard work. \n\n \n\n Obama has always told the truth about where he was born. But Trump has consistently lied about his birthplace on third base. Despite this, Trump\'s fabrication has not become the fodder for news stories or an issue in the presidential contest. That seems like a real double standard.\n\n \n\n During his presidential campaign, Trump has claimed that he made it on his own. When pushed, he acknowledges that his father loaned him what he\'s called the \"small amount\" of $1 million. In fact, Trump inherited his father\'s real-estate empire worth tens of millions of dollars, made by building middle-class housing financed by the federal government. Earlier in Donald\'s career, his father paid his son\'s debts. Donald also took several massive loans from his siblings\' trust funds.\n\nOne can see Trump\'s entire life as one of entitlement. But we can also see, in Trump\'s personality, someone who recognizes that he does not deserve his success. He is obsessively insecure and thin-skinned about his intelligence as well as about his manhood, and about his own accomplishments.\n\nIn 2004, in an interview with CNN, Trump said, \"I went to the Wharton School of Finance. I got very good marks. I was a good student. It\'s the best business school in the world, as far as I\'m concerned.\"\n\nTrump has repeated that claim many times since. Each time, it isn\'t clear if he\'s trying to convince his interviewer or himself.\n\nIn 2011, in another interview with CNN, Trump said: \"Let me tell you, I\'m a really smart guy. I was a really good student at the best school in the country,\" referring to the Wharton business school at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\n\"I went to the Wharton School of Finance,\" he said multiple times during a speech last year in Phoenix. \"I\'m, like, a really smart person.\"\n\nIn an interview on NBC\'s \"Meet the Press\" last year, he described Wharton as \"probably the hardest there is to get into.\" He added, \"Some of the great business minds in the world have gone to Wharton.\"\n\nOnly someone who questions his own intelligence would feel compelled to make these public statements.\n\nTrump surely knows that he didn\'t get into Wharton on his own merits. He transferred into Wharton\'s undergraduate program after spending two years at Fordham University in New York. But Trump\'s grades at Fordham were not good enough to transfer to the University of Pennsylvania, the home of the Wharton School. In her 2001 biography, The Trumps, Gwenda Blair wrote that Trump got into Wharton as a special favor from a \"friendly\" admissions officer who knew Trump\'s older brother, Freddy.\n\nMoreover, a 2011 article in Salon reported that Trump has exaggerated his academic accomplishments at Wharton. According to Salon, on at least two occasions -- in a 1973 profile and in an article in 1976 -- the New York Times reported that Trump \"graduated first in his class\" at Wharton in 1968.\n\nThat is a lie. Trump didn\'t even make the honor roll while at Wharton. It is likely that Trump was the original source for that falsehood, but it isn\'t entirely clear, since neither Times story attributes it to Trump. But the lie that Trump was first in his class was repeated in many other articles as well as books about Trump, so he clearly knew that it was out there in the public domain, and didn\'t bother to correct it.\n\n\"He was not in any kind of leadership. I certainly doubt he was the smartest guy in the class,\" Steve Perelman, Trump\'s Wharton classmate, told the Daily Pennsylvanian, the campus newspaper, last year.\n\nTrump\'s efforts to portray himself as an up-by-his-own-bootstraps entrepreneur is typical of the the self-made-man myth surrounding someone who was born on third base but refuses to acknowledge his birthplace.\n\n\"It has not been easy for me,\" Trump said at a town hall meeting on October 26, 2015. \"And you know I started off in Brooklyn. My father gave me a small loan of a million dollars.\"\n\nAt a news conference early this year, Trump repeated the same story: \"I got a very, very small loan from my father many years ago. I built that into a massive empire and I paid my father back that loan.\"\n\nAn investigation by the Washington Post earlier this year demolished the idea that Trump made it on his own. Not only did Trump\'s multi-millionaire father provide Donald with a huge inheritance, and set up big-bucks trust accounts to provide his son with a steady income, but his father also was a silent partner in Trump\'s first real estate projects.\n\nHis father\'s real estate fortune was due, in large measure, to his reliance on government financing and subsidies for his middle-class apartment buildings. It was only because of financing from the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) that Fred Trump was able to revive his real estate business and build homes for middle-income families. During World War 2, Fred Trump constructed FHA-backed housing for US naval personnel near major shipyards along the East Coast. After the war, he continued to rely on FHA financing to construct apartment buildings in New York.\n\nFred Trump\'s real estate business was also littered with widespread racial discrimination. Earlier this year the Washington Post revealed that Fred Trump had been arrested at a Ku Klux Klan rally in New York in 1927. His racism pervaded his business practices. The federal government sued him for denying black families the opportunity to rent apartments in his buildings. When Donald went into business with his father in the 1970s, those racist practices continued, as the New York Times reported. In other words, Donald not only inherited his father\'s real estate empire, he also inherited his racism.\n\nTrump\'s first big real estate deal was the construction of the Grand Hyatt hotel, near New York\'s Grand Central station, in 1978. Fred Trump\'s Village Construction Corp. provided a $1 million loan. But, as the Post investigation explained, \"that loan was only a small part of the father\'s involvement in the deal.\"\n\nAccording to the Post:\n\n\"Trump\'s father -- whose name had been besmirched in New York real estate circles after investigations into windfall profits and other abuses in his real estate projects -- was an essential silent partner in Trump\'s initiative. In effect, the son was the front man, relying on his father\'s connections and wealth, while his father stood silently in the background to avoid drawing attention to himself.\"\n\nWayne Barrett\'s 1992 book, Trump: The Deals and the Downfall, reveals the magnitude of his father\'s involvement. Fred Trump and the Hyatt hotel chain jointly guaranteed the $70 million construction loan from Manufacturers Hanover bank, \"each assuming a 50 percent share of the obligation and each committing itself to complete the project should Donald be unable to finish it.\"\n\nTrump\'s father was not only his silent partner but also his safety net. In a 2007 deposition, Donald admitted that he borrowed at least $9 million from his future inheritance when he encountered financial difficulties. In effect, Donald was on welfare. The funding came from his father, not the government. But it actually came indirectly from the government, which had financed Fred Trump\'s real estate business.\n\nOther investigations have shown that Trump\'s business career is filled with multiple bankruptcies, bogus businesses (like Trump University), repeated rip-offs of suppliers, contractors and employees who he failed to pay for services rendered, and misuse of the Trump Foundation to feather his own nest while trying to look like a philanthropist. Trump has also lied about the size of his wealth, as various business publications have pointed out. Many observers suggest that one reason Trump has refused to release his tax returns is that they will show that he has repeatedly exaggerated his wealth and, thus, his success.\n\nLike Obama\'s Hawaiian birth certificate, the Washington Post\'s investigation provides the documentation confirming Trump\'s birthplace on third base. But even though he was born on third base, he has had to lie, cheat, and break the law in order to get to home plate.\n\nPeter Dreier is professor of politics and chair of the Urban & Environmental Policy Department at Occidental College.

Thatd be a big problem, Trump said when asked about the topic. Itd be a very precarious one for Republicans because hed be running and the courts may take a long time to make a decision. You dont want to be running and have that kind of thing over your head. Trump added: Id hate to see something like that get in his way. But a lot of people are talking about it and I know that even some states are looking at it very strongly, the fact that he was born in Canada and he has had a double passport.\n\nNow, theObama administration has jumped in on the action.\n\nWhat Trump seems to forget is that questions have been raised in the past about his own eligibility for the Presidency based on the Constitutions natural-born citizen clause. Back in 2011, when he was making an attempt of sorts at running for the Presidency, many of the typical birther websites were confronting the question.\n\nWhy? His mother, Mary Anne Trump (nee MacLeod) was born in Scotland.Politicos Ben Smith did a great job summarizing and satirizing the issue:\n\nI refuse to link to sites like WorldNetDaily or the various birther websites out there on the front page, but heres a screencap of the first page of Googles search results for Mary Anne Trump Citizenship, as it shows up on my laptop:\n\nAs you can see, this was a legitimate issue birthers had to deal with in 2011,* and though my screencap does not show it, people beyondWorldNetDaily were discussing the question, including birther extraordinaire Mario Apuzzo himself. Despite the fact that Trump was born in America, this is something they felt the need to investigate. In the end, both that factand that his mother became a citizen in 1942, four years before he was born, proved that he was a citizen to them. It should have been beyond dispute since he was born in Jamaica Hospital in Queens, New York, but nevertheless, they arrived at the correct answer.\n\nWhile Ben Smith didnt mention it in his piece, Trumps got quite a bit of an international streak in him beyond his private plane. AsThe Federalist notes, also jokingly:\n\nThe short answer is that Trump, Cruz, Rubio, Obama, Santorum, Jindal, and McCain (reaching back to2008) are all natural born citizens, and they are all Constitutionally eligible to run for President. They were either born in the United States, abroad to at least one American citizen parent, or on an overseas American military base. If you need more confirmation of all of this, you can read my collection of posts from 2012 on the issue.** Its time this idiotic argument was sent to the dung heap of history.\n\n*=Bud Meyers, at least, is a lefty blogger trolling people on the issue, which is fine. Birther arguments deserve mockery.\n\n**=I had planned to write a third full installment in the series. That basically fell by the wayside, as I thought the first two did enough of a job showing how wrong birthers are. Perhaps its time I reconsidered that decision.','2017-03-25 03:51:13'),(290,38,'326c1dc3d0cfd09759de03ec368c6fc5d8f40a309c6109d2852738a88653511f','f7a8d7c5bb224754a1704635ebe49083','','','Donald John Trump (born June 14, 1946) is an American businessman, television personality, politician, and the 45th President of the United States.\n\nHe was born in Jamaica, Queens, New York City where he lived until enrolling at age 13 in the New York Military Academy. Trump received an economics degree from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania in 1968. In 1971, he took charge of his family\'s real estate and construction firm, Elizabeth Trump & Son, which was later renamed The Trump Organization. During his business career, Trump built, renovated, and managed numerous office towers, hotels, casinos, and golf courses. He has lent the use of his name in the branding of various products. He owned the Miss USA and Miss Universe pageants from 1996 to 2015, and he hosted The Apprentice, a reality television series on NBC, from 2004 to 2015. As of 2016 , Forbes listed him as the 324th wealthiest person in the world, and 113th in the United States, with a net worth of $4.5billion.\n\nTrump sought the Reform Party\'s 2000 presidential nomination, but withdrew before voting began. He considered running as a Republican for the 2012 election, but decided against it. In June 2015, he announced his candidacy for the 2016 election, and quickly emerged as the front-runner among 17 candidates in the Republican primaries. His final opponents suspended their campaigns in May 2016, and in July he was formally nominated at the Republican National Convention along with Mike Pence as his running mate. His campaign received unprecedented media coverage and international attention. Many of his statements in interviews, on social media, and at campaign rallies were controversial or false.\n\nTrump won the general election on November 8, 2016, in a surprise victory against Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. He became the oldest and wealthiest person to assume the presidency, the first without prior military or government service, and the fifth elected with less than a plurality of the national popular vote.\n\nTrump\'s platform emphasizes renegotiating U.S.China relations and free trade agreements such as NAFTA and the Trans-Pacific Partnership, strongly enforcing immigration laws, and building a new wall along the U.S.Mexico border. His other positions include pursuing energy independence while opposing climate change regulations such as the Clean Power Plan and the Paris Agreement, modernizing and expediting services for veterans, repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act, abolishing Common Core education standards, investing in infrastructure, simplifying the tax code while reducing taxes for all economic classes, and imposing tariffs on imports by companies offshoring jobs. He advocates a largely non-interventionist approach to foreign policy while increasing military spending, \"extreme vetting\" of immigrants from Muslim-majority countries to preempt domestic Islamic terrorism, and aggressive military action against ISIS. His positions have been described by scholars and commentators as populist, protectionist, and nationalist.\n\nTrump was born on June 14, 1946, at the Jamaica Hospital Medical Center in the Jamaica neighborhood of Queens, New York City. He was the fourth of five children born to Frederick Christ \"Fred\" Trump (19051999) and Mary Anne Trump (ne MacLeod, 19122000).[2][3] His siblings are Maryanne, Fred Jr., Elizabeth, and Robert. Trump\'s older brother Fred Jr. died in 1981 from alcoholism, which Trump says led him to abstain from alcohol and cigarettes.[4]\n\nTrump is of paternal German ancestry and maternal Scottish ancestry. His mother and grandparents were born in Europe.\n\nHis paternal grandfather, Friedrich Trump, originally emigrated to the United States in 1885, became a citizen in 1892, and amassed a fortune operating boom-town restaurants and boarding houses in the Seattle area and Klondike, Canada.[5] After marrying in 1902, the family moved back to Kallstadt but were ordered to leave because Friedrich did not complete the mandatory military service and did not register his initial emigration to the United States.[6]\n\nHis father was born in the Bronx, and became a New York City real estate developer.[7][8] His mother emigrated to New York (where she worked as a maid) from her birthplace of Tong, Lewis, Scotland.[9] Fred and Mary met in New York and married in 1936, raising their family in Queens.[9][10]\n\nHis uncle, John G. Trump, a professor at MIT from 1936 to 1973, was involved in radar research for the Allies in the Second World War, and helped design X-ray machines that prolonged the lives of cancer patients; in 1943, the Federal Bureau of Investigation requested John Trump examine Nikola Tesla\'s papers and equipment when Tesla died in his room at the New Yorker Hotel.[11]\n\nThe Trump family were originally Lutherans, but Trump\'s parents belonged to the Reformed Church in America.[12] The family name, which was formerly spelled Drumpf, was changed to Trump during the Thirty Years\' War in the 17th century.[13] Trump has said that he is proud of his German heritage; he served as grand marshal of the 1999 German-American Steuben Parade in New York City.[14]\n\nTrump attended the Kew-Forest School. At 13, he enrolled in the New York Military Academy (NYMA),[17] in Cornwall, New York, where he finished eighth grade and high school.\n\nTrump attended Fordham University in the Bronx for two years, beginning in August 1964. He then transferred to the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, which offered one of the few real estate studies departments in United States academia at the time.[18][19] While there, he worked at the family\'s company, Elizabeth Trump & Son, named for his paternal grandmother.[20] He graduated from Penn in May 1968 with a Bachelor of Science degree in economics.[19][21][22]\n\nTrump was not drafted during the Vietnam War.[23] While in college from 1964 to 1968, he obtained four student deferments.[24] In 1966, he was deemed fit for service based upon a military medical examination, and in 1968 was briefly classified as fit by a local draft board, but was given a 1-Y medical deferment in October 1968.[25] He has attributed his medical deferment to heel spurs.[26] In 1969, he received a high number in the draft lottery, which would also have likely exempted him from service.[25][27][28]\n\nTrump has five children by three marriages, and has eight grandchildren.[29][30] His first two marriages ended in widely publicized divorces.[31]\n\nTrump married his first wife, Czech model Ivana Zelnkov, on April 7, 1977, at the Marble Collegiate Church in Manhattan in a ceremony performed by the Reverend Norman Vincent Peale.[32][33] They had three children: son Donald Jr. (born December 31, 1977), daughter Ivanka (born October 30, 1981), and son Eric (born January 6, 1984). Ivana became a naturalized United States citizen in 1988.[34] The couple divorced in 1990 following Trump\'s affair with actress Marla Maples.[35]\n\nIn October 1993, Maples gave birth to their daughter Tiffany, named after Tiffany & Company.[36] They married two months later on December 20, 1993.[37] The couple divorced in June 1999.[38][39]\n\nTrump married Slovene model Melania Knauss, on January 22, 2005 at Bethesda-by-the-Sea Episcopal Church, on the island of Palm Beach, Florida, followed by a reception at Trump\'s Mar-a-Lago estate.[40][41][42] In 2006, Melania became a naturalized United States citizen.[43] She gave birth to their son Barron on March 20, 2006.[44][45] Barron is fluent in Slovene and English.[46]\n\nTrump identifies as Presbyterian.[47] As a child, he began going to church at the First Presbyterian Church in Jamaica, Queens.[48] He attended Sunday school and had his confirmation at that church.[48] Trump said in 2015 that he attends Reformed Marble Collegiate Church in Manhattan, where he married his first wife Ivana in 1977, and the church says he is not an \"active member\".[48] He is also loosely affiliated with Lakeside Presbyterian Church in West Palm Beach, Florida, near his Mar-a-Lago estate.[49] In December 2016, Trump visited Bethesda-by-the-Sea, an Episcopal church, for Christmas services.[50]\n\nTrump has said that he participates in Holy Communion. Beyond that, he has not asked God for forgiveness, stating: \"I think if I do something wrong, I just try and make it right. I don\'t bring God into that picture.\"[51]\n\nTrump refers to his ghostwritten book The Art of the Deal as \"my second favorite book of all time, after the Bible. Nothing beats the Bible\".[52][53] In a speech to Liberty University, he referred to Second Corinthians as \"Two Corinthians\", eliciting chuckles from the audience.[54] Despite this, The New York Times reported that Evangelical Christians nationwide thought \"that his heart was in the right place, that his intentions for the country were pure\".[55]\n\nOutside of his church affiliations, Trump has relationships with a number of Christian spiritual leaders, including Florida pastor Paula White, who has been described as his \"closest spiritual confidant.\"[56] In 2015, he asked for and received a blessing from Greek Orthodox priest Emmanuel Lemelson[57] and, in 2016, released a list of his religious advisers, including James Dobson, Jerry Falwell Jr., Ralph Reed and others.[58]\n\nReferring to his daughter Ivanka\'s conversion to Judaism before her marriage to Jared Kushner, Trump said in 2015: \"I have a Jewish daughter; and I am very honored by that [] it wasn\'t in the plan but I am very glad it happened.\"[59]\n\nA 2016 medical report by his doctor, Harold Bornstein M.D., showed that Trump\'s blood pressure, liver and thyroid function were in normal ranges.[60][61] Trump says that he has never smoked cigarettes or consumed other drugs, including marijuana.[62] He also does not drink alcohol, a decision stemming from his brother\'s death from alcoholism.[4][63][64][65]\n\nTrump was listed on the initial Forbes List of wealthy individuals in 1982 as having an estimated $200million fortune, including a share of his father\'s estimated $200million net worth.[66] He was absent from the list from 1990 to 1995 following losses which reportedly obliged him to borrow from his siblings\' trusts in 1993.[66] Trump told campaign audiences he began his career with \"a small loan of one million dollars\" from his father, which he paid back with interest.[67]\n\nOn June 16, 2015, when announcing his candidacy, Trump released a one-page financial summary stating a net worth of $8,737,540,000.[69] \"I\'m really rich\", he said.[70] Forbes believed his suggestion of $9billion was \"a whopper\", figuring it was actually $4.1 billion.[71] The summary statement includes $3.3 billion worth of \"real estate licensing deals, brand and branded developments\", putting a figure on Trump\'s estimate of his own brand value.[72] The July 2015 FEC disclosure reports assets worth above $1.4 billion and debts above $265million. According to Bloomberg, Trump \"only reported revenue for [his] golf properties in his campaign filings even though the disclosure form asks for income\", whereas independent filings showed his European golf properties to be unprofitable.[73] Trump has stated that his income for the year 2014 was $362million.[74]\n\nAfter Trump made controversial remarks about illegal immigrants in 2015, he lost business contracts with NBCUniversal, Univision, Macy\'s, Serta, PVH Corporation, and Perfumania, which Forbes estimated negatively impacted his net worth by $125million.[75] The value of the Trump brand may have fallen further during his presidential campaign, as some consumers boycotted Trump-branded products and services to protest his candidacy.[76] Bookings and foot traffic at Trump-branded properties fell off sharply in 2016,[77][78] and the release of the Access Hollywood tape recordings in October 2016 exacerbated this.[79]\n\nIn their 2016 annual billionaires\' rankings, Forbes estimated Trump\'s net worth at $4.5 billion (113th in the United States, 324th in the world)[1] and Bloomberg at $3billion,[73] making him one of the richest politicians in American history. Trump himself stated that his net worth was over $10billion,[74] with the discrepancy essentially stemming from the uncertain value of appraised property and of his personal brand.[73][80]\n\nPrior to graduating from the University of Pennsylvania, Trump began his real estate career at his father\'s company,[81] Elizabeth Trump and Son,[82] which focused on middle-class rental housing in the New York City boroughs of Brooklyn, Queens, and Staten Island. During his undergraduate study, Donald Trump and his father, Fred Trump, used a $500,000 investment to successfully reopen the foreclosed Swifton Village apartment complex in Cincinnati, Ohio.[83]\n\nAfter being promoted to president of the company in the early 1970s (while his father became chairman of the board), he renamed it to The Trump Organization.[84][85] In 1973, he and his father drew wider attention when the Justice Department contended that the organization systematically discriminated against African Americans wishing to rent apartments, rather than merely screening out people based on low income as the Trumps stated. An agreement was later signed in which the Trumps made no admission of wrongdoing, and under which qualified minority applicants would be presented by the Urban League.[86][87]\n\nTrump\'s first major real estate deal in Manhattan was the remodeling of the Grand Hyatt Hotel in 1978, located next to Grand Central Terminal. The building was remodeled from an older Commodore Hotel, and was largely funded by a $70million construction loan jointly guaranteed by Fred Trump and the Hyatt hotel chain.[88][89]\n\nIn 1978, Trump finished negotiations to develop Trump Tower, a 58-story, 202-meter (663-foot) skyscraper in Midtown Manhattan, for which The New York Times attributed his \"persistence\" and \"skills as a negotiator\".[90] The building was completed in 1983, and houses both the primary penthouse condominium residence of Donald Trump and the headquarters of The Trump Organization.[91][92] Trump Tower was the setting of the NBC television show The Apprentice, and includes a fully functional television studio set.[93]\n\nRepairs on the Wollman Rink in Central Park, built in 1955, were started in 1980 by a general contractor unconnected to Trump. Despite an expected 21 -year construction schedule, the repairs were not completed by 1986. Trump took over the project, completed it in three months for $750,000 less than the initial budget of $1.95million, and operated the rink for one year with all profits going to charity in exchange for the rink\'s concession rights.[94]\n\nTrump acquired the Plaza Hotel in Manhattan in 1988 for $400million, and asked his then-wife Ivana to manage its operation and renovation.[95]\n\nTrump acquired the historic Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida, in 1985 for $5million, plus $3million for the home\'s furnishings. It was built from 1924 to 1927 by heiress and socialite Marjorie Merriweather Post, who envisioned the house as a future winter retreat for American presidents.\n\nIn addition to using the home for this purpose, Trump also turned it into a private club with membership fees of $150,000. At about the same time, he acquired a condominium complex in Palm Beach with Lee Iacocca that became Trump Plaza of the Palm Beaches.[96]\n\nHarrah\'s at Trump Plaza opened in Atlantic City, New Jersey in 1984. The hotel/casino was built by Trump with financing by Holiday Corp.[97] and operated by the Harrah\'s gambling unit of Holiday Corp. The casino\'s poor results exacerbated disagreements between Trump and Holiday Corp.[98] Trump also acquired a partially completed building in Atlantic City from the Hilton Corporation for $320million. When completed in 1985, the hotel/casino became Trump Castle. Trump\'s wife, Ivana, managed the property.[99]\n\nLater in 1988, Trump acquired the Taj Mahal casino in Atlantic City in a transaction with Merv Griffin and Resorts International.[100] The casino was opened in April 1990, and was built at a total cost of $1.1billion, which at the time made it the most expensive casino ever built.[101][102] Financed with $675million in junk bonds[103] at a 14% interest rate, the project entered Chapter 11 bankruptcy the following year.[104] Banks and bondholders, facing potential losses of hundreds of millions of dollars, opted to restructure the debt.\n\nThe Taj Mahal emerged from bankruptcy on October 5, 1991, with Trump ceding 50percent ownership in the casino to the bondholders in exchange for lowered interest rates and more time to pay off the debt.[105] He also sold his financially challenged Trump Shuttle airline and his 282-foot (86m) megayacht, the Trump Princess.[103][106][107] The property was repurchased in 1996 and consolidated into Trump Hotels & Casino Resorts, which filed for bankruptcy in 2004 with $1.8billion in debt, filing again for bankruptcy five years later with $50million in assets and $500million in debt. The restructuring ultimately left Trump with 10% ownership in the Trump Taj Mahal and other Trump casino properties.[107] Trump served as chairman of the organization, which was renamed Trump Entertainment Resorts, from mid-1995 until early 2009, and served as CEO from mid-2000 to mid-2005.[108]\n\nIn 2011 after Chris Christie became governor, Trump casinos settled a long-running $30 million tax dispute for 17 cents on the dollar.[109] In 2015, the Taj Mahal\'s parent company settled for $10 million in a money-laundering lawsuit brought by the U.S. government, admitting only to record-keeping and reporting violations.[110]\n\nDuring the 1990s, Trump\'s casino ventures faced competition from the Native-American owned Foxwoods casino in Connecticut. In 1993, Trump made controversial comments in his testimony to a Congressional committee, famously stating that the casino owners did not look like real Indians.[111][112] But despite that well-publicized quote which related to the Mashantucket Pequot Tribe, Trump became a key investor who backed the Paucatuck Eastern Pequots who were seeking state recognition.[113]\n\nTrump has never filed for personal bankruptcy, but his hotel and casino businesses have been declared bankrupt six times between 1991 and 2009 in order to re-negotiate debt with banks and owners of stock and bonds.[114][115] Because the businesses used Chapter 11 bankruptcy, they were allowed to operate while negotiations proceeded. Trump was quoted by Newsweek in 2011 saying, \"I do play with the bankruptcy laws they\'re very good for me\" as a tool for trimming debt.[116][117]\n\nThe six bankruptcies were the result of over-leveraged hotel and casino businesses in Atlantic City and New York: Trump Taj Mahal (1991), Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino (1992), Plaza Hotel (1992), Trump Castle Hotel and Casino (1992), Trump Hotels and Casino Resorts (2004), and Trump Entertainment Resorts (2009).[118][119][120] Trump said, \"I\'ve used the laws of this country to pare debt ... We\'ll have the company. We\'ll throw it into a chapter. We\'ll negotiate with the banks. We\'ll make a fantastic deal. You know, it\'s like on The Apprentice. It\'s not personal. It\'s just business.\"[104]\n\nA 2016 analysis of Trump\'s business career by The Economist concluded that his \" performance [from 1985 to 2016] has been mediocre compared with the stock market and property in New York\", noting both his successes and bankruptcies.[121] A subsequent analysis by The Washington Post concluded that \"Trump is a mix of braggadocio, business failures, and real success.\"[122]\n\nTrump claimed a loss of $916million on his 1995 tax returns. As net operating losses from one year can be applied to offset income from future years, this loss allowed him to reduce or eliminate his taxable income during the eighteen-year carry forward period.[123] Trump acknowledged using the deduction but declined to provide details such as the specific years it was applied.[124] When questioned during a presidential debate about such practices, he stated that avoiding paying income tax through such methods \"makes me smart\".[125]\n\nThe New York Times found that some accountants considered Trump\'s tax deduction methods in the early 1990s \"legally dubious\".[126] Independent tax experts stated that \"Whatever loophole existed was not \'exploited\' here, but stretched beyond any recognition\" and that it involved \"sleight of hand\", further speculating that Trump\'s casino bankruptcies were probably related to Trump\'s 1995 reported loss.[127]\n\nAn analysis by USA Today, published in June 2016, found that over the previous three decades, Trump and his businesses had been involved in 3,500 legal cases in U.S. federal courts and state courts, an unprecedented number for a U.S. presidential candidate.[128] Of the 3,500 suits, mostly in the casino industry, Trump or one of his companies was the plaintiff in 1,900; defendant in 1,450; and third party, filer of bankruptcy, or other in 150.[128] Trump was named in at least 169 suits in federal court.[129]\n\nTrump acquired an old, vacant office building on Wall Street in Manhattan in 1996. After a complete renovation, it became the seventy-story Trump Building at 40 Wall Street.[130] After his father died in 1999, Trump and his siblings received equal portions[not in citation given] of his father\'s estate valued at $250300 million.[131]\n\nIn 2001, Trump completed Trump World Tower, a 72-story residential tower across from the United Nations Headquarters.[132] Trump also began construction on Trump Place, a multi-building development along the Hudson River. He continued to own commercial space in Trump International Hotel and Tower, a 44-story mixed-use (hotel and condominium) tower on Columbus Circle which he acquired in 1996,[133] and also continued to own millions of square feet of other prime Manhattan real estate.[134]\n\nTrump acquired the former Hotel Delmonico in Manhattan in 2002. It was re-opened with 35 stories of luxury condominiums in 2004 as the Trump Park Avenue.[135]\n\nMost recently, The Trump Organization has expanded its footprint beyond the United States, with the co-development and management of hotel towers in Chicago, Honolulu, Las Vegas, New York City, Washington D.C., Panama City, Rio de Janeiro, Toronto, and Vancouver.\n\nVarious of Trump\'s projects in Russia did not materialize. He pursued business deals in that country for over three decades beginning in 1987, and visited Russia a number of times personally to explore potential business opportunities.\n\nIn 1996, he filed trademark applications for potential Russian real estate development deals.[136][137] His partners and children have visited Moscow many times, connecting with developers and government officials to explore joint venture opportunities.[138][139][140][141] However, some of his real estate developments outside Russia have received a large part of their financing from private Russian investors, sometimes referred to as \"oligarchs\". In 2008 his son Donald Trump Jr. said \"Russians make up a pretty disproportionate cross-section of a lot of our assets\" and \"we see a lot of money pouring in from Russia\".[142][143][144] Trump hosted the 2013 Miss Universe pageant in Moscow, in partnership with Russian billionaire Aras Agalarov, but, as of 2017, he has no known investments or businesses in Russia.[138][140]\n\nThe Trump Organization operates many golf courses and resorts in the United States and around the world. The number of golf courses that Trump owns or manages is about 18, according to Golfweek.[145] Trump\'s personal financial disclosure with the Federal Elections Commission stated that his golf and resort revenue for the year 2015 was roughly $382million.[146][147]\n\nIn 2006, Trump bought the Menie Estate in Balmedie, Aberdeenshire, Scotland, creating a golf resort against the wishes of some local residents[148] on an area designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest.[149][150] A 2011 independent documentary, You\'ve Been Trumped, by British filmmaker Anthony S. Baxter, chronicled the golf resort\'s construction and the subsequent struggles between the locals and Trump.[151] Despite Trump\'s promises of 6,000 jobs, he stated in 2016 that the golf course has created only 200 jobs.[152] In June 2015, Trump made an appeal objecting to an offshore windfarm being built within sight of the golf course,[153] which was dismissed by five justices at the UK Supreme Court in December 2015.[154]\n\nIn April 2014, Trump purchased the Turnberry hotel and golf resort in Ayrshire, Scotland, which hosted the Open Championship 4 times between 1977 and 2009.[155][156] After extensive renovations and a remodeling of the course by golf architect Martin Ebert, Turnberry was re-opened on June 24, 2016.[157]\n\nIn 1971, Trump took charge of the family real estate firm, Elizabeth Trump & Son, and later renamed it The Trump Organization.[158][159] He greatly expanded its real estate operations as well as venturing into numerous other business activities. It eventually became the umbrella organization for several hundred individual business ventures and partnerships.[160]\n\nWhen Trump was elected president in November 2016, the question arose how he would avoid conflicts of interest with his business activities. At a press conference on January 10, 2017, Trump said he and his daughter Ivanka would resign all roles with The Trump Organization, while his two oldest sons Don Jr. and Eric would run the business, together with Chief Financial Officer Allen Weisselberg.[161]\n\nTrump retains his financial stake in the business.[162] His attorney Sherri Dillon said that before the January 20 inauguration, Trump would put those business assets into a trust, which would hire an ethics advisor and a compliance counsel. She added that the Trump Organization would not pursue any new foreign business deals, while continuing to pursue domestic opportunities.[163]\n\nIn September 1983, Trump purchased the New Jersey Generals, an American Football team playing in the United States Football League (USFL), from oil magnate J. Walter Duncan. The USFL played its first three seasons during the spring and summer, but Trump convinced the majority of the owners of other USFL teams to move the USFL 1986 schedule to the fall, directly opposite the National Football League (NFL), arguing that it would eventually force a merger with the NFL, which would supposedly increase their investment significantly.[164]\n\nAfter the 1985 season, the Generals merged with the Houston Gamblers, but had continuing financial troubles. The USFL, which was down to just seven active franchises from a high of 18, was soon forced to fold, despite winning an antitrust lawsuit against the NFL.[165]\n\nTrump remained involved with other sports after the Generals folded, operating golf courses in several countries.[165] He also hosted several boxing matches in Atlantic City at the Trump Plaza, including Mike Tyson\'s 1988 fight against Michael Spinks, and at one time, acted as a financial advisor to Tyson.[165][166][167]\n\nIn 1989 and 1990, Trump lent his name to the Tour de Trump cycling stage race, which was an attempt to create an American equivalent of European races such as the Tour de France or the Giro d\'Italia. The inaugural race was controversial, and Trump withdrew his sponsorship after the second Tour de Trump in 1990, because his other business ventures were experiencing financial woes. The race continued for several more years as the Tour DuPont.[168][169]\n\nTrump submitted a stalking-horse bid on the Buffalo Bills when it came up for sale following Ralph Wilson\'s death in 2014; he was ultimately outbid, as he expected, and Kim and Terrence Pegula won the auction.[170] During his 2016 presidential run, he was critical of the NFL\'s updated concussion rules, complaining on the campaign trail that the game has been made \"soft\" and \"weak\", saying a concussion is just \"a ding on the head\". He accused referees of throwing penalty flags needlessly just to be seen on television \"so their wives see them at home.\"[171]\n\nFrom 1996 until 2015,[172] Trump owned part or all of the Miss Universe, Miss USA, and Miss Teen USA beauty pageants. The Miss Universe pageant was founded in 1952 by the California clothing company Pacific Mills.[173] Trump was dissatisfied with how CBS scheduled his pageants, and took both Miss Universe and Miss USA to NBC in 2002.[174][175]\n\nIn 2015, NBC and Univision both ended their business relationships with the Miss Universe Organization after Trump\'s controversial 2015 presidential campaign remarks about Mexican illegal immigrants.[176][177] Trump subsequently filed a $500 million lawsuit against Univision, alleging a breach of contract and defamation.[178][179] The lawsuit was settled in February 2016, but terms of the settlement were not disclosed.[180]\n\nOn September 11, 2015, Trump announced that he had become the sole owner of the Miss Universe Organization by purchasing NBC\'s stake.[181][182] He sold his own interests in the pageant shortly afterwards to WME/IMG.[172]\n\nIn 1999, Trump founded a modeling company, Trump Model Management, which operates in the SoHo neighborhood of Lower Manhattan.[183] Together with another Trump company, Trump Management Group LLC, Trump Model Management has brought nearly 250 foreign fashion models into the United States to work in the fashion industry since 2000.[184] In 2014, the company, along with its president Corrine Nicolas and other managers, were sued by one of the agency\'s former models, Alexia Palmer, alleging racketeering, breach of contract, mail fraud, and violating immigrant wage laws.[185] Palmer alleged that Trump Model Management promised to withhold only 20% of her net pay as agency expenses, but after charging her for \"obscure expenses\", ended up taking 80%.[186] The case was dismissed from U.S. federal court in March 2016, in part because Palmer\'s immigration status, via H1-B visa sponsored by Trump, required labor complaints to be filed through a separate process.[186][187]\n\nTrump University LLC was an American for-profit education company that ran a real estate training program from 2005 until at least 2010.[188] After multiple lawsuits, it is now defunct. It was founded by Trump and his associates, Michael Sexton and Jonathan Spitalny, and offered courses, charging between $1,500 and $35,000 per course.[189][190] In 2005 the operation was notified by New York State authorities that its use of the word \"university\" violated state law, and after a second such notification in 2010, the name of the company was changed to the \"Trump Entrepreneurial Institute\".[191] Trump was also found personally liable for failing to obtain a business license for the operation.[192]\n\nIn 2013 the state of New York filed a $40million civil suit claiming that Trump University made false claims and defrauded consumers.[191][193] In addition, two class-action civil lawsuits were filed in federal court relating to Trump University; they named Trump personally as well as his companies.[194] During the presidential campaign, Trump repeatedly criticized judge Gonzalo P. Curiel who oversaw those two cases, alleging bias because of his Mexican heritage.[195][196][197] On June 7, 2016, Trump clarified that his concerns about Curiel\'s impartiality were not based upon ethnicity alone, but also upon rulings in the case.[198][199]\n\nThe Low v. Trump case was set for trial in San Diego beginning November 28, 2016. Shortly after Trump won the presidency, the parties agreed to a settlement of all three pending cases. In the settlement, Trump did not admit to any wrongdoing but agreed to pay a total of $25million.[201][202] The settlement was agreed to just an hour before a hearing regarding Trump\'s latest request to delay the trial until after the inauguration. Jason Forge, the attorney for the plaintiffs, said he \"definitely detected a change of tone and change of approach\" from the Trump representatives after the election.[203]\n\nTrump has marketed his name on a large number of building projects that are owned and operated by other people and companies, as well as licensing his name for various commercial products and services. In doing so, he achieved mixed success for himself, his partners, and investors in the projects.[204] In 2011, Forbes\' financial experts estimated the value of the Trump brand at $200million. Trump disputed this valuation, saying his brand was worth about $3billion.[205]\n\nBecause developers pay Trump to market their properties and to be the public face for their projects, some buildings that display his name are not owned or operated by him.[206][206] According to Forbes, this portion of Trump\'s empire, actually run by his children, is by far his most valuable, having a $562million valuation, with 33 licensing projects under development including seven Trump International Hotel and Tower \"condo hotels\".\n\nProperties to which Trump has licensed his name and image include two in Florida that have gone into foreclosure.[207] The Turkish owner of Trump Towers Istanbul, who pays Trump for the use of his name, was reported in December 2015 to be exploring legal means to dissociate the property after the candidate\'s call to temporarily ban Muslims from entering the United States.[208]\n\nTrump also licensed his name to son-in-law Jared Kushner\'s fifty-story Trump Bay Street, a Jersey City luxury development that has raised $50million of its $200million capitalization largely from wealthy Chinese nationals who, after making an initial down payment of $500,000 in concert with the government\'s expedited EB-5 visa program, can usually obtain United States permanent residency for themselves and their families after two years.[209] Trump is a partner with Kushner Properties only in name licensing and not in the building\'s financing.[209]\n\nThe Donald J. Trump Foundation is a U.S.-based private foundation[210] established in 1988 for the initial purpose of giving away proceeds from the book Trump: The Art of the Deal by Trump and Tony Schwartz.[211][212] The foundation\'s funds have mostly come from donors other than Trump,[213] who has not given personally to the charity since 2008.[213]\n\nThe foundation\'s tax returns show that it has given to health care and sports-related charities, as well as conservative groups.[214] In 2009, for example, the foundation gave $926,750 to about 40 groups, with the biggest donations going to the Arnold Palmer Medical Center Foundation ($100,000), the New YorkPresbyterian Hospital ($125,000), the Police Athletic League ($156,000), and the Clinton Foundation ($100,000).[215][216] From 2004 to 2014, the top donors to the foundation were Vince and Linda McMahon of WWE, who donated $5million to the foundation after Trump appeared at WrestleMania in 2007.[213] Linda McMahon later became Administrator of the Small Business Administration.[217]\n\nIn 2016, investigations by The Washington Post uncovered several potential legal and ethical violations conducted by the charity, including alleged self-dealing and possible tax evasion.[218] After beginning an investigation into the foundation, the New York State Attorney General\'s office notified the Trump Foundation that it was allegedly in violation of New York laws regarding charities, and ordered it to immediately cease its fundraising activities in New York.[219][220][221] A Trump spokesman called the investigation a \"partisan hit job\".[219] In response to mounting complaints, Trump\'s team announced in late December 2016 that the Trump Foundation would be dissolved to remove \"even the appearance of any conflict with [his] role as President\".[222]\n\nTrump has twice been nominated for an Emmy Award and has made cameo appearances in 12 films and 14 television series.[223] He has also played an oil tycoon in The Little Rascals. Trump is a member of the Screen Actors Guild and receives an annual pension of more than $110,000.[224][225] He has been the subject of comedians, flash cartoon artists, and online caricature artists. Trump also had his own daily talk radio program called Trumped![226][227][228]\n\nIn 2003, Trump became the executive producer and host of the NBC reality show The Apprentice, in which a group of competitors battled for a high-level management job in one of Trump\'s commercial enterprises. Contestants were successively \"fired\" and eliminated from the game. For the first year of the show, Trump earned $50,000 per episode (roughly $700,000 for the first season), but following the show\'s initial success, he was paid $1million per episode.[229] In a July 2015 press release, Trump\'s campaign manager said that NBCUniversal had paid him $213,606,575 for his 14 seasons hosting the show,[74] although the network did not verify the statement.[230] In 2007, Trump received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for his contribution to television on The Apprentice.[204][231]\n\nAlong with British TV producer Mark Burnett, Trump was hired as host of The Celebrity Apprentice, in which celebrities compete to win money for their charities. While Trump and Burnett co-produced the show, Trump stayed in the forefront, deciding winners and \"firing\" losers. International versions of The Apprentice franchise were co-produced by Burnett and Trump.\n\nOn February 16, 2015, NBC announced that they would be renewing The Apprentice for a 15th season.[232] On February 27, Trump stated that he was \"not ready\" to sign on for another season because of the possibility of a presidential run.[233] Despite this, on March 18, NBC announced they were going ahead with production.[234] On June 29, after widespread negative reaction stemming from Trump\'s campaign announcement speech, NBC released a statement saying, \"Due to the recent derogatory statements by Donald Trump regarding immigrants, NBCUniversal is ending its business relationship with Mr. Trump.\"[235]\n\nAfter Trump\'s election campaign and presidential win led to his departure from the program, actor and former California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger replaced Trump as host for the fifteenth season.[236] Trump is still credited as an executive producer for the show.[237]\n\nTrump is a WWE (World Wrestling Entertainment) fan, and a friend of WWE chairman and CEO Vince McMahon. In 198889 Trump hosted WrestleMania IV and V at Boardwalk Hall (dubbed \"Trump Plaza\" for storyline purposes) and has been an active participant in several of the shows.[238] He also appeared in WrestleMania VII, and was interviewed ringside at WrestleMania XX.[239]\n\nTrump appeared at WrestleMania 23 in a match called \"The Battle of the Billionaires\".[238] He was in the corner of Bobby Lashley, while Vince McMahon was in the corner of Lashley\'s opponent Umaga, with Stone Cold Steve Austin as the special guest referee.[238] The terms of the match were that either Trump or McMahon would have their head shaved if their competitor lost.[238] Lashley won the match, and so McMahon was shaved bald.[238]\n\nOn June 15, 2009, as part of a storyline, McMahon announced on Monday Night Raw that he had \"sold\" the show to Trump.[238] Appearing on screen, Trump declared he would be at the following commercial-free episode in person and would give a full refund to the people who purchased tickets to the arena for that night\'s show.[238] McMahon \"bought back\" Raw the following week for twice the price.[238]\n\nTrump was inducted into the celebrity wing of the WWE Hall of Fame in 2013 at Madison Square Garden for his contributions to the promotion. He made his sixth WrestleMania appearance the following night at WrestleMania 29.[240]\n\nTrump considered the idea of running for president in 1988, 2004, and 2012, and for Governor of New York in 2006 and 2014, but did not enter those races.[243][244] In February 2009, Trump appeared on the Late Show with David Letterman, and spoke about the automotive industry crisis of 200810. He said that \"instead of asking for money\", General Motors \"should go into bankruptcy and work that stuff out in a deal\".[245]\n\nAs Trump publicly speculated about seeking the 2012 Republican presidential nomination, a Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll released in March 2011 found Trump leading among potential contenders, one point ahead of former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney.[246] A Newsweek poll conducted in February 2011 showed Trump within a few points of Barack Obama, with many voters undecided in the November 2012 general election for president of the United States.[247] A poll released in April 2011 by Public Policy Polling showed Trump having a nine-point lead in a potential contest for the Republican nomination for president while he was still actively considering a run.[248][249] His moves were interpreted by some media as possible promotional tools for his reality show The Apprentice.[250][251][252]\n\nTrump played a leading role in \"birther\" conspiracy theories that had been circulating since President Barack Obama\'s 2008 presidential campaign.[253][254] Beginning in March 2011, Trump publicly questioned Obama\'s citizenship and eligibility to serve as President.[255][256][257] Although the Obama campaign had released a copy of the short-form birth certificate in 2008,[258] Trump demanded to see the original \"long-form\" certificate.[255] He mentioned having sent investigators to Hawaii to research the question, but he did not follow up with any findings.[255] He also repeated a debunked allegation that Obama\'s grandmother said she had witnessed his birth in Kenya.[259][260] When the White House later released Obama\'s long-form birth certificate,[261] Trump took credit for obtaining the document, saying \"I hope it checks out.\"[262] His official biography mentions his purported role in forcing Obama\'s hand,[263] and he has defended his pursuit of the issue when prompted, later saying that his promotion of the conspiracy made him \"very popular\".[264] In 2011, Trump had called for Obama to release his student records, questioning whether his grades warranted entry into an Ivy League school.[265] When asked in 2015 whether he believed Obama was born in the United States, Trump said he did not want to discuss the matter further.[266][267] In September 2016, Trump publicly acknowledged that Obama was born in the U.S., and said that the rumors had been started by Hillary Clinton during her 2008 presidential campaign.[256][268][269]\n\nTrump made his first speaking appearance at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in February 2011. His appearance at CPAC was organized by GOProud, an LGBT conservative organization, in conjunction with GOProud supporter Roger Stone, who was close with Trump. GOProud pushed for a write-in campaign for Trump at CPAC\'s presidential straw poll. The 2011 CPAC speech Trump gave is credited for helping kick-start his political career within the Republican Party.[270][271] Christopher R. Barron, co-founder of GOProud, would later endorse Trump\'s 2016 presidential campaign, and launch \"LGBT for Trump\", a political campaign with the goal of gaining the LGBT community\'s political support for Donald Trump.[272]\n\nIn the 2012 Republican primaries, Trump generally had polled at or below 17 percent among the crowded field of possible candidates.[273] On May 16, 2011, Trump announced he would not run for president in the 2012 election, while also saying he would have become the President of the United States, had he ran.[250]\n\nIn 2013, Trump was a featured speaker at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC).[274] During the lightly attended early-morning speech, Trump spoke out against illegal immigration, then-President Obama\'s \"unprecedented media protection\", and advised against harming Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security.[275][276]\n\nAdditionally, Trump spent over $1million in 2013 to research a possible run for president of the United States.[277] In October 2013, New York Republicans circulated a memo suggesting Trump should run for governor of the state in 2014 against Andrew Cuomo. In response to the memo, Trump said that while New York had problems and that its taxes were too high, running for governor was not of great interest to him.[278] In January 2014, Trump made statements denying climate change that were discordant with the opinion of the scientific community.[279] A February 2014 Quinnipiac poll had shown Trump losing to the more popular Cuomo by 37 points in a hypothetical election.[280] In February 2015, Trump told NBC that he was not prepared to sign on for another season of The Apprentice, as he mulled his political future.[281]\n\nIn 1999, Trump filed an exploratory committee to seek the presidential nomination of the Reform Party in 2000.[282][283] A July 1999 poll matching him against likely Republican nominee George W. Bush and likely Democratic nominee Al Gore showed Trump with seven percent support.[284] Trump eventually dropped out of the race due to party infighting, but still won the party\'s California and Michigan primaries after doing so.[285][286][287][288]\n\nTrump\'s political party affiliation has changed numerous times over the years. Trump\'s political party affiliations prior to 1987 remain unclear, though Trump was an early supporter of Republican Ronald Reagan for United States President in the late 1970s.[289] By 1987, Trump had identified as a Republican.[290]\n\nIn 1999, Trump switched to the Reform Party for three years and ran a presidential exploratory campaign for its nomination. After his run, Trump left the party in 2001 due to the involvement of David Duke, Pat Buchanan, and Lenora Fulani.[282]\n\nFrom 2001 to 2008, Trump identified as a Democrat, but in 2008, he endorsed Republican John McCain for President. In 2009, he officially changed his party registration to Republican.[291] In December 2011, Trump became an independent for five months before returning to the Republican Party, where he later pledged to stay.[292][293]\n\nTrump has made contributions to campaigns of both Republican Party and Democratic Party candidates, with the top ten recipients of his political contributions being six Democrats and four Republicans.[294] After 2011, his campaign contributions were more favorable to Republicans than to Democrats.[295] In February 2012, Trump openly endorsed Republican Mitt Romney for President.[296] When asked in 2015 which recent president he prefers, Trump picked Democrat Bill Clinton over the Republican Bushes.[297][298]\n\nAccording to a New York state report, Trump circumvented corporate and personal campaign donation limits in the 1980salthough no laws were brokenby donating money to candidates from 18 different business subsidiaries, rather than donating primarily in his own name.[299][300] Trump told investigators he did so on the advice of his lawyers. He also said the contributions were not to gain favor with business-friendly candidates, but simply to satisfy requests from friends.[299][301]\n\nOn June 16, 2015, Trump announced his candidacy for President of the United States at Trump Tower in New York City. In the speech, Trump drew attention to domestic issues such as illegal immigration, offshoring of American jobs, the U.S. national debt, and Islamic terrorism, which all remained large themes during the campaign. He also announced his campaign slogan, \"Make America Great Again\".[302]\n\nIn his campaign, Trump said that he disdained political correctness, stated that the media has intentionally misinterpreted his words, and made other claims of adverse media bias.[303][304][305] In part due to his fame, Trump\'s run for president received an unprecedented amount of unpaid coverage from the media that elevated his standing in the Republican primaries.[306]\n\nRepublican leaders such as House Speaker Paul Ryan were hesitant to support him early on. They doubted his chances of winning the general election and feared he could harm the image of the Republican Party.[307][308]\n\nThe alt-right movement coalesced around Trump\'s candidacy,[309] due in part to its opposition to multiculturalism and immigration.[310][311] Trump was accused of pandering to white nationalists.[312] In August, he appointed Steve Bannon as his campaign CEO, the executive chairman of Breitbart News, described by Bannon as \"the platform for the alt-right\".[313]\n\nSome rallies during the primary season were accompanied by protests or violence, including attacks on protesters inside the rallies, and clashes between protesters and Trump supporters outside the venues.[314][315][316]\n\nFact-checking organizations have denounced Trump for making a record number of false statements compared to other candidates.[317][318][319] At least four major publications Politico, The Washington Post, The New York Times, and the Los Angeles Times have pointed out lies or falsehoods in his campaign statements.[320] Trump\'s penchant for hyperbole is believed to have roots in the New York real estate scene, where Trump established his wealth. Trump has called his public speaking \"truthful hyperbole\", though online media outlets such as Yahoo! believed Trump\'s \"truthful hyperbole\" to be a political tactic.[321][322] Lucas Graves, an assistant professor at the University of WisconsinMadison School of Journalism & Mass Communication,[323] opined, of Trump\'s speaking, that Trump \"often speaks in a suggestive way that makes it unclear what exactly he meant, so that fact-checkers \"have to be really careful when you pick claims to check to pick things ... that reflect what the speaker was clearly trying to communicate\".[324] Other sources, such as NPR, also observed that Trump\'s statements during the campaign were often opaque or suggestive.[325]\n\nTrump entered a field of 16 candidates campaigning for the 2016 Republican nomination, the largest presidential field in American history.[326] Trump participated in eleven of the twelve Republican debates, skipping only the seventh debate on January 28 (that was the last debate before primary voting began on February 1). The debates received historically high viewership, increasing the visibility of Trump\'s campaign.[327]\n\nBy early 2016, the race had mostly centered on Trump and U.S. Senator Ted Cruz.[328] On Super Tuesday, Trump won the plurality of the vote and remained the front-runner throughout the remainder of the primaries. By March 2016, Trump became poised to win the Republican nomination.[329] After a landslide win in Indiana on May 3, 2016, which prompted the remaining candidates Ted Cruz and John Kasich to suspend their presidential campaigns, RNC Chairman Reince Priebus declared Trump the presumptive Republican nominee.[330] With nearly 14 million votes, Trump broke the all-time record for winning the most primary votes in the history of the Republican Party. He also set the record for the largest number of votes against the front runner.[331]\n\nAfter becoming the presumptive Republican nominee, Trump\'s focus shifted to the general election, urging remaining primary voters to \"save [their] vote for the general election\".[332] Trump began targeting Hillary Clinton, who became the presumptive Democratic nominee on June 6, 2016, and continued to campaign across the country. One month before the Republican National Convention, Secret Service agents thwarted an assassination attempt on Trump by a 20-year-old British man illegally residing in the U.S. during one of his rallies in Las Vegas.[333]\n\nClinton had established a significant lead in national polls over Trump throughout most of 2016. In early July, Clinton\'s lead narrowed in national polling averages following the FBI\'s conclusion of its investigation into her ongoing email controversy.[334][335][336] Of the matter, FBI Director James Comey opined Clinton had been \"extremely careless\" in her handling of classified government material.[337]\n\nOn July 15, 2016, Trump announced Indiana Governor Mike Pence as his running mate.[338] Trump and Pence were officially nominated by the Republican Party on July 19, 2016, at the Republican National Convention.[339] The list of convention speakers and attendees included former presidential nominee Bob Dole but the other prior nominees did not attend, though John McCain endorsed Trump prior to the convention.[340][341]\n\nTwo days later, Trump officially accepted the nomination in a 76-minute speech inspired by Richard Nixon\'s 1968 acceptance speech.[342] The historically long speech was watched by nearly 35million people and received mixed reviews, with net negative viewer reactions according to CNN and Gallup polls.[343][344][345]\n\nIn late July, Trump came close to Clinton in national polls following a 3 to 4 percentage point convention bounce, in line with the average bounce in conventions since 2004, although it was toward the small side by historical standards.[346] Following Clinton\'s 7 percent convention bounce, she extended her lead over Trump significantly in national polls at the start of August.[347][348]\n\nTrump has declined to publicly release any of his full tax returns,[349] which led to speculation about whether or not he was hiding something.[350] Pursuant to FEC regulations, Trump published a 92-page financial disclosure form that listed all his assets, liabilities, income sources and hundreds of business positions.[146]\n\nTrump said that his tax returns are being audited and his lawyers advise against release.[351][352] Trump has told the news media that his tax rate was \"none of your business\", but added, \"I fight very hard to pay as little tax as possible.\"[353][354] Every candidate since Gerald Ford in 1976 released their taxes before the election.[355] Although no law prohibits release of tax returns during an audit, tax attorneys differ about whether such a release is wise legal strategy.[356][357]\n\nIn January 2017, a We the People petition demanding Trump release his tax returns broke the White House record for number of signatures gathered.[358]\n\nOn September 26, 2016, Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton faced off in the first presidential debate at Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York. Lester Holt, an anchor with NBC News, was the moderator.[359] This was the most watched presidential debate in United States history.[360] The second presidential debate was held at Washington University in Saint Louis, Missouri. The beginning narrative of that debate was dominated by a leaked tape of Trump making lewd comments, and counter-accusations by Trump of sexual misconduct by Bill Clinton. Trump had invited four women who had accused Clinton of impropriety to a press conference prior to the debate. The final presidential debate was held at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas on October 19. Trump\'s refusal to say whether or not he would accept the result of the election, regardless of the outcome, drew particular press attention.[361][362]\n\nMedia have described Trump\'s political positions as \"populist\",[363][364] and some of his views cross party lines. For example, his economic campaign plan calls for large reductions in income taxes and deregulation,[365] consistent with Republican Party policies, along with significant infrastructure investment,[366] usually considered a liberal (Democratic Party) policy.[367][368] According to political writer Jack Shafer, Trump may be a \"fairly conventional American populist when it comes to his policy views\", but he attracts free media attention, sometimes by making outrageous comments.[369][370]\n\nTrump has supported or leaned toward varying political positions over time.[371][372][373] Politico has described his positions as \"eclectic, improvisational and often contradictory\",[373] while NBC News counted \"141 distinct shifts on 23 major issues\" during his campaign.[374]\n\nTwo days before the second presidential debate, a 2005 recording surfaced, made on a studio bus while preparing to film an episode of Access Hollywood. On the tape, Trump is heard bragging to the show\'s then-cohost Billy Bush about forcibly kissing and groping women.[375][376][377] \"I just start kissing them,\" he says, \"I don\'t even wait. And when you\'re a star, they let you do it, you can do anything... grab them by the pussy.\"[378] During the recording, Trump also speaks of his efforts to seduce a married woman, saying he \"moved on her very heavily\".[378] These statements were recorded several months after Trump married his third and current wife, Melania, who was pregnant at the time.[378][379]\n\nTrump\'s language on the tape was described by the media as \"vulgar\", \"sexist\", and descriptive of sexual assault. The incident prompted him to make his first public apology during the campaign,[380][381] and caused outrage across the political spectrum,[382][383] with many Republicans withdrawing their endorsements of his candidacy and some urging him to quit the race.[384] A number of Trump supporters worldwide also withdrew their support following release of the tape, including many Conservatives in Britain.[385] Subsequently, at least 15 women[386] came forward with new accusations of sexual misconduct, including unwanted kissing and groping, resulting in widespread media coverage.[387][388]\n\nTrump and his campaign have denied all of the sexual misconducting accusations, which Trump has called \"false smears\", and alleged a conspiracy against him.[389][390][391] In his two public statements in response to the controversy, Trump responded by alleging that Bill Clinton, former President of the United States and husband of Trump\'s Democratic rival Hillary Clinton, had \"abused women\" and that Hillary had bullied her husband\'s victims.[392]\n\nOn Election Day, November 8, 2016, Trump received 306 electoral votes to Clinton\'s 232 votes. The counts were later adjusted to 304 and 227 respectively, after defections on both sides, formalizing Trump\'s election to the presidency.[393] In the early hours of November 9, Clinton called Trump to concede the election. Trump then delivered his victory speech before hundreds of supporters in the New York Hilton hotel. The speech was in contrast with some of his previous rhetoric, with Trump promising to heal the division caused by the election, thanking Clinton for her service to the country, and promising to be a president to all Americans.[394][395]\n\nTrump received a smaller share of the popular vote than Clinton, making him the fifth person to be elected president after losing the popular vote since records began to be kept in 1824.[396][nb 1] Clinton finished ahead by 2.86 million votes or 2.1 percentage points, 48.04% to 45.95%, with neither candidate reaching a majority nationwide.[399][400]\n\nTrump\'s victory was considered a stunning political upset, as polls consistently showed Hillary Clinton leading nationwide and in most battleground states, while Trump\'s support had been underestimated throughout his campaign.[401] The errors in some state polls were later partially attributed to pollsters overestimating Clinton\'s support among well-educated and nonwhite voters, while underestimating Trump\'s support among white working-class voters.[402] Trump won the perennial swing states of Florida, Iowa and Ohio, and flipped Clinton\'s \"blue wall\" states of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, which had been Democratic strongholds since the 1990s. Trump\'s victory marked the return of a Republican White House combined with control both chambers of Congress, as was the case during parts of George W. Bush\'s presidency from 2003 to 2007.\n\nTrump became the first president without prior governmental or military experience.[403][404][405] Of the 44 previous presidents, 39 had held prior elective office; 2 had not held elective office but had served in the Cabinet; and 3 had never held public office but had been commanding generals.[405] He is the first Republican since the 1980s to win the states of Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin. He lost his home state of New York, becoming only the fourth candidate to win the presidency without his home state. The others were James Polk (Tennessee) in 1844, Woodrow Wilson (New Jersey) in 1916, and Richard Nixon (New York) in 1968.[406]\n\nTrump\'s victory sparked protests across the United States. Democrats, in alignment with other Trump opponents, took to the streets to amplify their opposition to Trump\'s views and denounce his inflammatory statements. They argued that Clinton\'s popular vote victory meant Trump was not actually the democratically elected president and should be considered illegitimate.[407] Trump initially said on Twitter that the protests consisted of \"professional protesters, incited by the media\", and were \"unfair\", but he later stated that he loves their passion for the country.[408][409] In contrast, after Obama\'s re-election in 2012, Trump had tweeted \"We can\'t let this happen. We should march on Washington and stop this travesty. Our nation is totally divided!\"[410]\n\nOn the Saturday following Trump\'s inauguration there were massive demonstrations protesting Trump in the United States and worldwide, with approximately 2,600,000 taking place in Women\'s Marches worldwide.[411] The most notable of these marches was the Women\'s March on Washington (in Washington, D.C.), where over 500,000 people marched in opposition to Trump.[412] This was more than three times the number of people who were at Trump\'s inaugural speech, according to crowd scientists at the Manchester Metropolitan University.[413]\n\nOn November 10, President-elect Trump had his first ever meeting with President Obama to discuss plans for a peaceful transition of power. The New York Times stated that \"It was an extraordinary show of cordiality and respect between two men who have been political enemies and are stylistic opposites.\"[414] The BBC stated that \"their antipathy was barely concealed\" in \"awkward photos\" of the meeting.[415]\n\nTrump\'s transition team was led by Chris Christie until November 11, 2016, when Vice President-elect Mike Pence took over.[416] Since then, Trump has chosen RNC chairman Reince Priebus as White House Chief of Staff[417] and businessman and media executive Steve Bannon as Counselor to the President.[418]\n\nHe has nominated Senator Jeff Sessions as Attorney General,[419] retired Lieutenant General Michael Flynn as National Security Advisor,[420] education reform activist Betsy DeVos as Secretary of Education,[421] Governor Nikki Haley as Ambassador to the United Nations,[422] former Secretary of Labor Elaine Chao as Secretary of Transportation,[423] U.S. Representative Tom Price as Secretary of Health and Human Services,[424] former campaign rival Ben Carson as Secretary of Housing and Urban Development,[425] financier Steve Mnuchin as Secretary of the Treasury,[426] billionaire investor Wilbur Ross as Secretary of Commerce,[427] retired Marine Corps General James Mattis as Secretary of Defense,[428] retired Marine Corps General John F. Kelly as Secretary of Homeland Security,[429] businessman Andrew Puzder as Secretary of Labor (later withdrawn, replaced by attorney and law school dean Alexander Acosta),[430][431] CEO of ExxonMobil Rex Tillerson as Secretary of State,[432] former Governor Rick Perry as Secretary of Energy,[433] U.S. Representative Ryan Zinke as Secretary of the Interior,[434] and Under Secretary for Health David Shulkin as Secretary of Veterans Affairs.[435]\n\nDespite being nominated promptly during the transition period, many cabinet members were unable to take office on Inauguration Day because of delays in the formal confirmation process. By February 8, 2017, President Trump had fewer cabinet nominees confirmed than any other president except George Washington by the same length of time into his presidency.[436][437] Part of the lateness was ascribed to the delays in submitting background-check paperwork, part to obstructionism by Senate Democrats.[438]\n\nOn November 22, in a video posted at YouTube, Trump outlined his plan for his first 100 days in office. The plan included the withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership and asking the Department of Defense to develop a plan to protect the United States from cyber-attack.[439][440]\n\nOn December 7, Time named Trump as its \"Person of the Year\".[441] In an interview on The Today Show, he said he was honored by the award, but he took issue with the magazine for referring to him as the \"President of the Divided States of America\".[442][443] He also opposed Time\'s decision to change its \"Man of the Year\" title to \"Person of the Year\" in 1999, describing the action as too \"politically correct\".[444] On December 13 he was named Financial Times Person of the Year.[445] In December 2016, Forbes ranked Trump the second most powerful person in the world, after Vladimir Putin and before Angela Merkel.[446]\n\nBased on intelligence reports issued from October 2016 to January 2017, the Obama administration accused the Russian government of trying to influence the US presidential election in favor of Trump, notably by supplying the DNC emails to WikiLeaks for publication.[447] Both Trump,[448] WikiLeaks[449] and Russian officials[450] have denied the allegations.\n\nIn January 2017, Trump was briefed on a private intelligence dossier containing \"potentially compromising personal and financial information\" about his activities in Russia,[451] which he denied.[452] The dossier was also leaked to the press and published.[453] Media evaluation of the dossier ranged from \"garbage\"[454] to \"partially corroborated\".[455]\n\nThe inauguration of Donald Trump as the 45th President of the United States was held on Friday, January 20, 2017. In his first week as president, Trump signed six executive orders. His first order as president stood to minimize \"the economic burden\" of the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. That same week, Trump withdrew the United States from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, re-instated the Mexico City Policy, reopened the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipeline construction projects and launched the process to build a new Mexico border wall and reinforce border security.[456]\n\nOn January 27, President Trump signed an executive order that suspended admission of refugees for 120 days and denied entry to citizens of Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen for 90 days, citing security concerns about terrorism. The following day, thousands of protesters gathered at airports and other locations throughout the United States to protest the signing of the order and detainment of the foreign nationals.[457] Later, the administration seemed to reverse a portion of part of the order, effectively exempting visitors with a green card.[458][459] Two Iraqi nationals detained upon arrival filed a complaint.[460] Several federal judges issued rulings that curtailed parts of the immigration order, stopping the federal government from deporting visitors already affected.[459]\n\nOn March 6, 2016, Trump issued a revised executive order, that, among other differences with the original order, excluded Iraq, visa-holders, and perminent residents from the temporary suspension and did not differentiate Syrian refugees from refugees from other countries.[461]\n\nOn January 31, Trump nominated U.S. Appeals Court judge Neil Gorsuch to fill the vacancy on the Supreme Court left by the death of Justice Antonin Scalia.[462]\n\nTrump\'s energy policy advocates domestic industrial support for both fossil and renewable energy sources in order to curb reliance on Middle-Eastern oil and possibly turn the U.S. into a net energy exporter.[463] His appointed advisers favor a less regulated energy market and, because they do not consider climate change a threat, see no need for immediate action.[464]\n\nTrump does not accept the scientific consensus on climate change.[465][466] In 2012, he said that global warming was a hoax invented by the Chinese, but later said that he was joking.[467][468] He has called the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) a \"disgrace\" and has threatened to cut its budget.[469] Trump has pledged to eliminate the Clean Power Plan[470] and withdraw from the Paris Climate Agreement, which calls for reductions in carbon emissions in more than 170 countries.[471] After winning the presidency, Trump admitted \"some connectivity\" between human activity and climate variability and said he has an \"open mind\" towards the Paris agreement.[472]\n\nTrump\'s immigration policies were intensely discussed during the campaign. Trump vowed to build a more substantial wall on the MexicoUnited States border to keep out illegal immigrants, a wall which Trump promised Mexico would pay for.[473][474][475][476] He pledged to massively deport illegal immigrants residing in the United States,[477] and criticized birthright citizenship as it creates \"anchor babies\".[478] He said the focus of deportation would be criminals, those who have overstayed their visas, and other \"security threats\".[479]\n\nFollowing the November 2015 Paris attacks, Trump made a controversial proposal to completely ban Muslim non-citizens from entering the United States until stronger vetting systems could be implemented.[480][481][482] Later in 2016 he stated that the ban would apply only to people originating from countries with a \"proven history of terrorism against the United States or its allies\", or countries \"compromised by terrorism\".[483][484][485]\n\nIn late January 2017 Trump issued an executive order banning the admission of immigrants from seven predominantly Muslim countries. The order, imposed without warning and effective immediately, caused chaos at many airports. Multiple legal challenges were filed against it, and a federal court blocked its implementation.[486] In early March 2017, Trump issued a revised order into law.[461]\n\nTrump is conservative, describes himself as pro-life and generally opposes abortion with some exceptions: rape, incest, and circumstances endangering the health of the mother.[487] He has said that he is committed to appointing justices who would try to overturn the ruling in Roe v. Wade.[488] He personally supports \"traditional marriage\"[467] but considers the nationwide legality of same-sex marriage a \"settled\" issue.[488]\n\nTrump supports a broad interpretation of the Second Amendment and says he is opposed to gun control in general,[489][490] although his views have shifted over time.[491] Trump opposes legalizing recreational marijuana but supports legalizing medical marijuana.[492] He favors capital punishment,[493][494] as well as the use of waterboarding.[495][496]\n\nIn 1999, Trump told Larry King Live that \"I believe in universal healthcare.\"[497] Trump\'s 2000 book, The America We Deserve, argued strongly for a single-payer healthcare system based on the Canadian model,[498] and has voiced admiration for the Scottish National Health Service.[497][499][500]\n\nHowever, Trump has repeatedly vowed to repeal and replace Obamacare.[501][502] In March 2016, Trump\'s campaign released a platform summary which included a variety of free-market health reforms including provisions to allow health insurance to be sold across state lines, enable individuals to deduct health insurance premiums, expand health savings accounts, and give more control of Medicaid to the states.[503][504]\n\nTrump aims to streamline the Department of Veterans Affairs, getting rid of backlogs and waitlists, and upgrading relevant facilities.[505] On his first Monday in office, Trump issued a federal hiring freeze on the VA.[506]\n\nTrump has stated his support for school choice and local control for primary and secondary schools.[507] He opposes the Common Core State Standards Initiative for primary and secondary schools,[508] and has called Common Core \"a disaster\" that must be ended.[509] He has stated he would abolish all or part of the Department of Education.[510]\n\nTrump\'s campaign tax plan called for levelling the corporate tax rate to 15%, eliminating various business loopholes and deductions,[365] and reducing the number of brackets for personal income tax: the top rate would be reduced from 39.6% to 25%, a large \"zero bracket\" would be created, and the alternative minimum tax and estate tax (which currently applies to individual estates over $5.45 million or $10.9 million per married couple) would both be eliminated.[511] His comments about the minimum wage have been inconsistent.[512][513][514]\n\nTrump identifies as a \"free trader\", but says that trade must be \"reasonably fair\".[515] He has often been called a \"protectionist\",[516][517][518] because of his criticism of NAFTA,[519][520] the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP),[521] and his proposal to raise tariffs on Chinese and Mexican exports to the United States significantly.[522][523] He has also been critical of the World Trade Organization, threatening to leave unless his proposed tariffs are accepted.[524][525] However, Trump has been very keen to support a \"fair\" post-Brexit trade deal with the United Kingdom,[526] which Trump claims would be \"good for both sides\".[527]\n\nTrump has been described as non-interventionist[528][529] and nationalist.[530] Trump repeatedly stated that he supports \"America First\" foreign policy.[531] He supports increasing United States military defense spending,[530] but favors decreasing United States spending on NATO and in the Pacific region.[532] He says America should look inward, stop \"nation building\", and re-orient its resources toward domestic needs.[529] As a candidate he questioned whether he, as president, would automatically extend security guarantees to NATO members,[533] and suggested that he might leave NATO unless changes are made to the alliance.[534]\n\nIn order to confront the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), Trump in 2015 called for seizing the oil in ISIS-occupied areas, using U.S. air power and ground troops.[535] In 2016, Trump advocated sending 20,000 to 30,000 U.S. troops to the region,[371][536][537] a position he later retracted.[538] Regarding the IsraeliPalestinian conflict, Trump has stated the importance of being a neutral party during potential negotiations, while also having stated that he is \"a big fan of Israel\".[539] During the campaign he said he would relocate the U.S. embassy in Israel to Jerusalem from its current location, Tel Aviv, although he has not pursued that proposal as president.[540]\n\nTrump has considered recognizing Crimea as Russian territory and lifting sanctions on Russia in the past;[541][542] however, in the aftermath of Michael T. Flynn\'s resignation as National Security Adviser, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said that Trump expects Russia to \"return\" Crimea to Ukraine,[543] emphatically stating that \"Crimea is a part of Ukraine. Our Crimea-related sanctions will remain in place until Russia returns control of the peninsula to Ukraine\".[544] He added that Trump\'s appointed ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, \"strongly denounced the Russian occupation\" of Crimea.[544] Trump has pledged to hold a summit meeting with Vladimir Putin.[545] He added that Russia could help the U.S. in fighting ISIS militants.[546]\n\nTrump signaled his intent to run for a second term by filing with the FEC within hours of assuming the presidency.[547][548] This transformed his 2016 election committee into a 2020 reelection one.[549] The early timing of the beginning of the campaign was highly unorthodox. Trump marked the official start of the campaign with a campaign rally in Melbourne, Florida on February 18, 2017, less than a month after taking office.[550] By February 1, 2017, the campaign had already raised over $7 million.[551]','2017-03-25 03:51:13'),(291,38,'326c1dc3d0cfd09759de03ec368c6fc5d8f40a309c6109d2852738a88653511f','90cba41aed4e4a9498a9b73b63cfb6a5','','','Based on the official birth certificate of the US presidential hopeful, Trump was born in Queens, New York on June 14, 1946.

Is it true that Donald Trump was born in the Philippines?\n\nAccording to Snopes, it is understandable that readers will think that Keillor is stating a fact because the author did not indicate that it was just a satire. However, from the first stanza of the poem, the website pointed out that it was clearly written to blast the Republican presidential candidate.\n\nSnopes added that that satirical poem was made to attack Trump for creating conspiracy theories since the campaign started. And before Keillor ended his piece, he launched a straightforward jab at Trump.\n\nThe man is a fraud, a compulsive liar and a clueless playboy whose presidency would be an unmitigated disaster for the country, Keillor wrote. If you would make us the laughingstock of the world just to irk your liberal sister-in-law, you are someone who should not be allowed to come within 500 yards of an elementary school.\n\nKeillor added that a Trump victory in the election will not be good for the future generation in terms of making them aware of the value of education. The humorist also added that it is quite baffling that millions are planning to vote for a man who has not lived based on cherished values in New York.\n\nWant to receive more Donald Trump updates?

We want to nurture bold experiments and help the movement build the solid infrastructure that will enable it to flourish.\n\nFortune Magazine wrote that the foundations announcement would make anyone sit up straighter if they read it in a pitch deck [a presentation for startups seeking investor capital]. The contribution of such an immense sum of money is a gift from the ruling class that will allow Black Lives Matter to construct a bureaucracy of salaried staff and lobbyist positions. The influx of money will bring the movement greater influence through campaign contributions and integrate it even more closely with the Democratic Party and the corporate media.\n\nThe Ford Foundation will also provide various forms of consultancy and advisory assistance to a consortium of 14 groups associated with Black Lives Matter. Both the financing and the auxiliary services are to be organized through a fund called the Black-Led Movement Fund (BLMF), which is being overseen by a firm called Borealis Philanthropy.\n\nThe Ford Foundation receives the bulk of its endowment from corporate contributors and very wealthy donors through trusts and bequeathments. Established in 1936 by Ford Motor Company founder Henry Ford and his son, Edsel, it today boasts the third largest endowment of any foundation, valued at roughly $12.4 billion.\n\nThe Ford Foundation has for years maintained close ties to US military and intelligence agencies. A British historian of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), Frances Stonor Saunders, described the Ford and Rockefeller Foundations in her book The Cultural Cold War: The CIA and the World of Arts and Letters as conscious instruments of covert US policy, with directors and officers who were closely connected to, or even members of American intelligence.\n\nToday, the foundation is not formally connected to Ford Motor Company, but its board of directors is a whos who of powerful corporate players, including CEOs and Wall Street lawyers. The chairperson of the board of directors is Irene Inouye, widow of deceased Democratic Senator Daniel Inouye.\n\nThe $100 million gift is an acknowledgment by a powerful section of the ruling class that the aims of the Black Lives Matter movement are aligned with those of Wall Street and the US government.\n\nIn an interview with Bloomberg News in 2015, the Ford Foundations current president, Darren Walker, an ex-banker at UBS, spelled out the pro-capitalist perspective underlying the foundations decision to bankroll Black Lives Matter:\n\nInequality in many ways undermines our vision for a more just and fair world, he said. Indeed, the American people, and its not just the Trump supporters, are feeling increasingly vulnerable, increasingly insecure, and what that does is it drives wedges in our society, in our democracy. Inequality is bad for our democracy. It kills aspirations and dreams and makes us more cynical as a people What kind of Capitalism do we want to have in America?\n\nThe foundations support for Black Lives Matter is an investment in the defense of the profit system. Black Lives Matter portrays the world as divided along racial lines, proclaiming on its web site that it sees itself as part of a global black family.\n\nIt claims that black people are extended families and villages that collectively care for one another, and especially our children It explicitly rejects the notion that any other section of society has the right to raise grievances of its own. Its group history page notes: Not just all lives. Black lives. Please do not change the conversation by talking about how your life matters, too.\n\nThe petty-bourgeois leaders of the Black Lives Matter movement are now poised to exercise a significant degree of political influence directed at securing privileges within the political elite. A quick look at the founders of Black Lives Matter gives a sense of the opportunist and self-promotional character of the group as a whole. The official Black Lives Matter organization was founded by three people: Alicia Garza, Patrisse Cullors and Opal Tometi. The three met as members of BOLD (Black Organizing for Leadership and Dignity). BOLD is one of the 14 organizations now being funded by the Black-Led Movement Fund.\n\nOne of these founders, Garza, runs an organization called the National Domestic Workers Alliance, on whose board sits Alta Starr. Starr oversees a fund at the Ford Foundation. She is also on the board of a foundation backed by billionaire George Soros, the Open Society Foundations Southern Initiative.\n\nPatrisse Cullers is the director of the Ella Baker Center for Human Rights. This organization was founded by Van Jones, a Democrat who worked under Obama as a special advisor on green jobs, enterprise and innovation. He is also a long time contributor to CNN. This organization also receives funds from the Open Society Foundation.\n\nA leaked document from an October 2015 board meeting of the Soros-funded US Programs/Open Society revealed that the organization provided $650,000 to invest in technical assistance and support for the groups at the core of the burgeoning #BlackLivesMatter movement. The document notes that the board planned to discuss the difficulty of dealing with a de-centralized movement: What happens when you want to throw a lot of money at a moment[sic], but there isnt any place for it to go? It was also raised that the Soros name could discredit Black Lives Matter if the public became aware of his financial support.\n\nMany of the organizations on the list of Ford recipients are also members of the newly-formed Movement for Black Lives, which has published a policy agenda document centered on demands for greater government financing of black-owned businesses and institutions.\n\nIn an earlier period, nationalist movements such as the Black Panthers, however politically disoriented, had a genuine element of social struggle and conflict with the state. While their political program was of a petty-bourgeois character, they had a significant base of support among the oppressed. This was the period of the mass civil rights movement against Jim Crow segregation in the South and the urban rebellions in the North.\n\nIn response to the upheavals of the late 1960s, a section of the ruling class sought to cultivate a base of support among the more privileged sections of minorities that would be loyal to the status quo. As a result of policies such as affirmative action, social inequality among African-Americans has soared, with a small elite holding positions of power in corporate America and the state. This found its apotheosis in the election of Barack Obama to preside as president over a historic transfer of wealth to the financial aristocracy following the Wall Street crash of 2008.\n\nThese social transformations are reflected in the political outlook of the Black Lives Matter movement, which is devoid of any genuine element of social protest or democratic struggle. The agenda of these organizations, as underscored by the support of groups like the Ford Foundation, has nothing to do with the real social and economic grievances of millions of workers and young people of any race or ethnicity. They speak for highly privileged sections of the middle class who are fighting over the distribution of wealth within the top 10 percent of the population.\n\nIn the face of rising popular opposition to war, police violence and social inequality, the decision to advance the racialist program of Black Lives Matter is aimed at dividing the working class and preventing the emergence of an independent and unified working class movement against the capitalist system.\n\nThe socioeconomic basis of identity politics: Inequality and the rise of an African American elite \n\n[30 August 2016]','2017-03-25 03:51:13'),(303,40,'36fba891aa4dbf51c4a48d9eac25308bf71e9a17e074830525fcc72db89f785e','a19d767c10094172a29955bae667c35e','','','Ellen McGirt at Fortune Magazine reports that the Black Lives Matter movement will receive millions of dollars in funding from the Ford Foundation.

As we do so, we believe its essential that our funding not dictate or distort the work underway.\n\nSickening though the Ford Foundations piece is, I got a kick out of the last sentence.\n\nHow much money will the Ford Foundation and its partners funnel to BLM? According to Edmund Kozak at PoliZette, the above-mentioned Borealis Philanthropy says the goal is to bring $100 million in new resources to the Movement for Black Lives. Without distorting BLMs work, of course.\n\nNo one should be surprised that the Ford Foundation will fund BLM. It is a thoroughly leftist operation and has been for decades.\n\nThe folks at the Foundation surely were thrilled by the recent wide-ranging set of BLM demands, which I discussed in a post called From a lie to a revolution. I suspect that the document was written with an eye towards obtaining funding or in collaboration with potential big funders or people closely connected with them. This is probably why the BLM demands touched so many leftist bases (though Im not sure it explains the demand to help prostitutes).\n\nBlack Lives Matter has taken the place of Occupy Wall Street as the vanguard of a concerted, lawless, and if necessary violent push for the radical transformation of America  total social upheaval and systemic change, as BLM activists put it. The movement is, as several of its founders have said, the vessel through which all progressive causes can flow. And it is a far more serviceable vessel than Occupy Wall Street.\n\nBLMs push for total social upheaval and systemic change will be aided and abetted by outfits like Ford Foundation that strike uninformed Americans as mainstream. It will also be aided and abetted by politicians who are viewed as mainstream liberals.\n\nThe left may be overplaying its hand. Its one thing for BLM organizers and activists to be giddy. They say they have never before felt such a sense of hope and excitement that total social upheaval and systemic change can be realized in their lifetime. Having little to lose, they naturally want to seize the day.\n\nIts another thing for organizations and politicians who pose as mainstream to view the BLM moment as the right time to remove the mask and embrace a group that encourages lawlessness and violence against the police.

In turn, BLMF will serve as a donor network supportingthe Movement for Black Lives , a social justice movement endorsed by Black Lives Matter, according to a foundation blog post:\n\nThe Movement for Black Lives has created an opportunity for philanthropy tosee and learn from new and dynamic forms of social justice leadership andinfrastructure.

In partnership with donors and activists, the BLMF aims to support philanthropic and field-building activities that strengthen the next generation of social justice leaders. Specifically, the collaborative effort supports the infrastructure, innovation and dynamism of intersectional Black-led organizing that have become integral components of what many call the Movement for Black Lives (M4BL).\n\nRumors about the Ford Foundation pledging more than $100 million to Black Lives Matter went viral after the announcement. The Washington Timesreportedthat Black Lives matter had cashed inwith the Ford Foundations donation  and, aside from (falsely) implyingthat Black Lives Matter would receive the entire $100 million donation, the report was factually correct. But, as similarreports spread across social media and conservative news sites, details started getting fuzzy.Freedom Daily, a right-wing website,demonstrates how that happened in apost calling for a Ford boycott thatwas shared nearly 30,000 times on social media within a weekthat begins:\n\nThe Washington Post reported: street uprising, Black Lives Matter is increasingly awash in cash,raking in pledges of more than $100 million from liberal foundations and others eager to contributeto what has become the grant-making cause du jour.\n\nThis story (and calls for Ford boycotts that followed it) made three critical errors: it confused the Washington Post with the Washington Times, it confused the Ford Motor Company with the Ford Foundation, and it confused the Black-Led Movement Fund with Black Lives Matter.\n\nIn reality, the Ford Motor Company and the Ford Foundation are completely separate organizations since the 1970s.Henry Fords son, Edsel, started the Ford Foundation in 1936 with an initial gift of $25,000. The foundation took in huge bequests from Henry and Edsels estates upon their deaths in the 1940s and grew to become the biggest philanthropy in the world at the time.\n\nEdsels son, Henry Ford II, was involved inthe Ford Foundation up until 1976, but the foundation began selling off Ford stocks in the 1950s and moved its headquarters from Dearborn, Michigan, toNew York City in the 1960s. Ford IIresigned overthe foundations march to the left in 1976, and no Ford family member has servedon the board of trustees since. Today, the Ford Motor Company has a separate nonprofit arm, the Ford Fund, and is in no way connected to the Ford Foundation.\n\nIn the end, the Ford Foundation and the Ford Motor Company are completely separate organizations. And theFord Foundation pledged $100 million to the Black-Led Movement Fund, which is not the same thing asBlack Lives Matter.

And diverse: the movement is led largely by young black women and men, queer people of color and immigrants. The mix is reflected in the language and the issues.\n\nFor some, the agenda may help dispel the myth that the movement itself is set on violence. For others, it will confirm their worst fears.

SeeExample(s)\n\nAugust 2016 saw the circulation of rumors holding that the Ford Motor Company had donated a large sum of money (typically between one and 100 million dollars) directly to the Black Lives Matter movement:\n\nA (since removed) blog post published by Allen B. Wests blog on 11 August 2016 called for a boycott of the automaker over the issue:\n\nFord is investing in the Black-Led Movement Fund in partnership with Borealis Philanthropy Movement Strategy Center, and Benedict Consulting. Well, if you were ever looking for a reason not to buy a Ford vehicle or to trade one in you already have, this seems to be just as good as any. Looks like another American icon just caved to the liberal agenda. We see how well that worked out for Target Hopefully enough people will express displeasure over this to prompt Ford to stop playing politics and get back to making cars.\n\nThe origins of the rumor lay with a 19 July 2016 announcement from the Ford Foundation titled Why black lives matter to philanthropy explaining why that foundation had made six-year investments in the organizations and networks that compose the Movement for Black Lives:\n\nWe are living in anxious, often frightening times. Earlier this month, the deaths of Philando Castile and Alton Sterling sparked a new round of public protest against the toxic blend of racism, hypermasculinity, and state violence that has taken the lives of too many black men and women and people of color in the US. At one protest in Dallas, a lone gunman killed five police officersLorne Ahrens, Michael Krol, Michael J. Smith, Brent Thompson, and Patrick Zamarripa. Weve seen reductive attempts to frame the murders in Dallas as a confrontation between protesters and law enforcement, but that obscures the larger democratic principles at play: The officers died while protecting the right to freedom of expression and peaceful protest, and are inexorably linked to Philando Castile and Alton Sterling. These events  added to so many others, including the fatal shootings of three police officers in Baton Rouge on Sunday morning  have the potential to either deepen empathy and understanding among Americans or divide us even more sharply along lines of race, ethnicity, and gender. Thats why now is the time to stand by and amplify movements rooted in love, compassion, and dignity for all people. Now is the time to call for an end to state violence directed at communities of color. And now is the time to advocate for investment in public services  including but not limited to police reform  together with education, health, and employment in communities and for people that have historically had less opportunity and access to all those things.These are the reasons we support the Movement for Black Lives.\n\nHowever, the flaw in claiming that the Ford Motor Company donated millions of dollars to the Black Lives Matter movement is two-fold. First, although the philanthropic Ford Foundation is so named because it was created and originally funded by automobile icon Henry Ford (along with his son Edsel) and because the foundation was a large holder of Ford stock, those associations ended many years ago. No member of the Ford family or Ford Motor Company management sits on the Ford Foundation Board of Trustees, and the Ford Foundation began selling off its Ford Motor Company stock in the mid-1950s (a process that was completed in 1974). The completely separate Ford Motor Company Fund and Community Services is the current philanthropic arm of the Ford Motor Company.\n\nSecond, although they may have common goals, the Black Lives Matter movement and the Movement for Black Lives are not the same thing. The latter is not a single group or movement, but rather a coalition of over 50 black-led organizations:\n\nBlack humanity and dignity requires black political will and power. In response to the sustained and increasingly visible violence against Black communities in the U.S. and globally, a collective of more than 50 organizations representing thousands of Black people from across the country have come together with renewed energy and purpose to articulate a common vision and agenda.

Rather, it is the work of Kenyan political cartoonist Godfrey Mwampembwa, better known as Gado, and it is meant to be a spoof on the many travel warnings Western countries have placed on African countries. Tourism in Kenya has been hit hard by travel advisories maintained against coastal regions close to Somalia.\n\nIts funny because many African countries go through those travel advisoriesissued by mostly by Europe and US, all the time, Gado told Quartz.\n\nBut there is perhaps some basis for warning Africans traveling to America.

Olango, who was mentally ill, was shot after he pulled out a vape smoking device.\n\nBlack Lives Matter has certainly shocked and caught the attention of many in Africa, said Gado, who was attending the recent American Editorial Cartoonists Convention in Durham, North Carolina, when protests broke out about 150 miles away in Charlotte.\n\nIn some ways, Africans can identify with the frustration black Americans feel toward their police. Forced disappearances and extrajudicial killings by police in Kenya prompted local demonstrations in July. Kenyans are five times as likely to be killed by police than by an armed robber. So far this year, Kenyan police have killed 122 citizens, almost one every other day.\n\nI think most Africans relate to the Black Lives Matter movement, because they face police brutality all the time and have been fighting against it all along, Gado said.\n\nSign up for the Quartz Africa Weekly Brief  the most important and interesting news from across the continent, in your inbox.','2017-03-25 03:51:13'),(314,41,'37aef1aff6d685d0d62d8b536a2b26fbecfae346a666f5e68559dd667cbe63e2','6f57701a26e24bfab0a2986dbd3be4d9','','','An African Union Travel Advisory warned Africans heading for the U.S. about \"continued instability\" in America.\n\nA recent satirical piece on racial unrest in the U.S. by a Kenyan political cartoonist was picked up by some African news outlets and reported as fact.\n\nThe cartoon by Godfrey Mwampembwa (a.k.a.

The African Union warns the continents citizens of continued instability in the United States of America (USA). The number of unarmed black civilians murdered has dramatically increased.

Like a nine-year-old Ivanka walking to school swarmed by paparazzi in the midst of her parents messy divorce and still actually going to school to face her Upper East Side classmates. Or hearing her fathers repeated comments about how attractive she is and still appearing side by side with him as an executive at his company. More recently, as Donald Trumps campaign navigates one gaffe after anothera call for Second Amendment people to do something to block Hillary Clinton from appointing judges, or calling on Russian hackers to target his political enemies, for exampleIvanka has gone about promoting her eponymous lifestyle brand with little acknowledgment of her fathers fires burning around her.\n\nAs Donald sat down to tape an interview with ABCs This Week in which he trashed a Gold Star family, for example, Ivanka went on posting some tips on throwing your next #summer soiree #HostessWithTheMostess on Instagram. Now, she has her own brand, apart from her fathers, to get on with, and it is fair to assume that many people looking to Ivanka for hostess tips arent fazed by her fathers sit-down on a Sunday-morning political show. But the ultimate act of compartmentalization came when Ivanka posted an Instagram ode to her friend Wendi Deng last week, celebrating her profile in Vogue by calling her one of those friends that inspires you to work hard.\n\nIvanka followed it up a few days later with a snapshot of the two sightseeing together in Croatia.\n\nThe two make for an interesting pairing. Deng, who was married to and subsequently divorced from conservative media billionaire Rupert Murdoch, had reportedly been romantically linked with Vladimir Putin (a rumor that has not been, at all, confirmed). Of course, Ivankas father has, in recent months, been accused of his own links to Putin. (That Hollywood bigwigs David Geffen and Brian Grazer were also tagged in the Croatia photo make this more like a version of summer billionaire bingo than anything.)\n\nThe rumored Putin connections likely have nothing to do with one another, but that doesnt mean the dots werent easy enough to connect (or note with a laugh, at least). It is not exactly the sharpest political move, to highlight any sort of link, in the midst of a presidential campaign.\n\nBut Deng and Ivanka have a long history together. In fact, Deng is reportedly responsible for re-uniting Ivanka and her husband, Jared Kushner, who broke up in 2008 when their religious differences caused them to split. A new New Yorker profile of the couple relays how Deng invited Jared for a weekend on the Murdoch family yacht. Youre working so hard. Come with Rupert and me on the boat for the weekend, she said. He showed up without knowing that Deng had also invited Ivanka. Trump later converted to Judaism, and the couple married in 2009.\n\nIt is not surprising, then, that someone so adept at building mental walls between her life and her fathers foibles would publicize a politically inexpedient European holiday with a friend whose network of associations are not ideally suited to the Trump campaign.

Our goal is to save as many viable lives as possible by getting animals that are at risk of euthanasia out of shelters, and into approved, foster based rescue organizations.  All of this takes a lot of time, passion, dedication and coordinating.Since April 2016 alone, 503 cats, 242 dogs, (27 which were pitbulls) and 40 exotic animals (for a total of 785 animals, not counting wildlife, adoptions and claimed) were transferred out of Montreal area pounds and into reputable rescues in Montreal, Ontario, Nova-Scotia, Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta.It has been a team effort; with the help of dedicated volunteers from foster-based rescues, rescue coordinators, and animal rescue transport organizations such as Freedom Drivers, this was made possible. We have worked tirelessly on rehoming pitbull type dogs, so much so that our efforts have picked up media traction, such as CTV News ( http://regina.ctvnews.ca/mobile/stray-pit-bulls-get-new-leash-on-life-in-saskatchewan-1.3049699 ), The Gazette ( http://montrealgazette.com/life/freedom-drivers-help-unwanted-animals-find-the-road-to-a-new-life ), CJAD News, CBC, Global News, Leader Post, Mtl Dog Blog, and The Dodo .On Tuesday, September 27th, the unthinkable happened: the Montreal city council voted in favour of changes to its animal control bylaw, passing with a vote of 37-23, the second most sweeping Breed Specific Legislation in the Country. The community of Montreal is distraught, as it opposes such a bylaw which has been a failure both historically and scientifically. As of October 3rd 2016, no one in the city of Montreal is entitled to adopt a Pitbull, meaning that all Pitbull or Pitbull-type dogs that are stray, in shelters, pounds, or foster-based rescue organizations are at risk of euthanasia  regardless of their docile temperament.Most of the animals that are saved come with pull fees, transportation fees and extensive vet fees; and this is entirely covered through fundraising, donations and adoption fees. With the overwhelming number of Pitbulls whose lives are now being threatened, OLC now, more than ever need your help and donations to offset some of the transportation and vetting expenses required to ensure these adorable and innocent dogs\' safety.These innocent animals have rescues and foster homes waiting for them across Canada  but we need to get them there, with your help. In considering jumping on board to save lives, please remember that by doing so, you are not only being the voice for Pitbulls. You are being the voice for ALL animals in need of homes, whether cats, dogs, rabbits, birds, etc... This is for the dog that cuddles you every night, the cat that passed away in your arms, the stray colony that seeks shelter under your balcony, the bunny you could never imagine eating, and all the other animals yourself, or a loved one, cares so deeply for. They without a doubt give you a reason to go on, lets come together and do the same for them.Thank you from the bottom of our hearts for helping us help them in such a time of need.

The attack caused a province-wide debate on the breed  of course blaming any dog even slightly resembling a pit bull as a monster. Ironically, media has since reported the dog involved in the womans death identified the dog, named Lucifer, as a boxer with a previous bite record.\n\nAccording to the Montreal Gazette, during the last 30 years in Quebec, five other people have been killed by dogs, and all of the dogs involved were described as from the husky breed. No laws have ever been introduced to ban huskies in Quebec, argued Ewa Demianowicz, a spokesperson for the Canadian branch of the Humane Society International.\n\nThe Montreal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals stated the controversial legislation is unfair, unenforceable, and most importantly ineffective.\n\nThe new legislation will define the following as pit bulls:\n\nFor anyone owning a dog fitting the above description, owners who live in Montreal, will be required to obtain a special permit by December 31, 2016. In addition the law now creates two categories of dogs of all breeds  at risk and dangerous. An at-risk dog is any pet that exhibits aggressive behavior such as having bitten someone. If a dog is deemed dangerous, the council will be able to act accordingly.\n\nSocial media has erupted with animal lovers posting photos of their pit bulls  calling the council a disgrace. Anyone with a dog with a square head is afraid they might be stigmatized, forced to make their dogs wear muzzles or even ordered to have their dogs euthanized.\n\nAnd as animal lovers everywhere hear the decision was based on common sense and not a scientific debate making it opinion over facts, one can only hope the ignorance will end.','2017-03-25 03:51:13'),(327,43,'3a7e40b988f0db8656f41eafcfd67d028cb6dac5264a8a82fb820fb37ae36142','471fb1a51dec499fba447caed331205a','','','Adopting or buying a pit-bull type dog in Montreal will be illegal as of Monday.\n\nDespite numerous protests and hours of impassioned debate in council, councillors on Tuesday voted in favour of the contentious bylaw created by Mayor Denis Coderres administration that will outlaw the acquisition of any pit-bull type dogs starting next week, and impose strict and costly regulations on current owners of roughly 7,000 dogs.\n\nWhile the bylaw passed by a vote of 37-23 based on Coderres insistence it is needed to protect citizens from the type of attack that took the life of 55-year-old Christiane Vadnais in June, it faces numerous obstacles. Montreal lawyers have promisedto contest it in court, including by filing an injunction within weeks. Animal rights advocates are pledging ongoing protests and have already collected online signatures from 115,000 individuals promising to boycott the city. The SPCA has said it may cancel services to 10 of the citys 19 boroughs rather than euthanize healthy animals. And opposition councillors are characterizing the law as hastily improvised to garner headlines, unenforceable and doomed to fail.\n\nWe are very disappointed by what has happened, said Luc Ferrandez, leader of opposition party Projet Montral. There is strong proof it wont work, evidenced by the fact numerous municipalities and countries have already repealed their bans. Toronto is rethinking its ban and Ottawa is no longer following the one adopted by the province of Ontario in 2005.\n\nThe city shouldtarget dangerous dogs and irresponsible owners, as opposed tobreeds, Ferrandez said. Banning a breed will only spur bad owners to get a different type of intimidating animal.\n\nCoderre said his administration had no choice but to adopt the bylaw in the face of police statistics showingpit bulls are responsible for an inordinate percentage of attacks in the city: pit bulls were reported as responsiblein 38 per cent of dog bites over the last 21 months. If other dogs prove dangerous they could be added to the ban, he said.\n\nI have a responsibility as the mayor of Montreal to protect all Montrealers and to ensure they feel secure, he said. The vast majority of them want me to take concrete measures.\n\nAnie Samson, the city executive committee member responsible for public safety, had the same message:I think as an elected official the responsibility that we have, above all, is to choose the human ahead of the animal. And with this bylaw, that is what we are doing.\n\nUnder the new bylaw, all dog and cat owners will have to obtain a licence for their cat or dog or face a minimum fine of $300. To date, only about 20 per cent of the citys estimated 150,000 dogs are licenced. The fee is $10 for cats and $25 for dogs. Owners of pit-bull type dogs (American Staffordshire terriers, Staffordshire bull terriers and American pit bull terriers), pit-bull mixes or any dog with similar physical characteristics have until Dec. 31 to apply for a special permit with the city, or risk having their dog euthanized. (A calendar with the dates and locations where pit-bull type dogs can get the permit is at www.ville.montreal.qc.ca/animaux)\n\nThe dogs must be sterilized, micro-chipped and vaccinated for rabies by March 1, 2017. (All dogs regardless of breed must be sterilized and microchipped by Dec. 31, 2019.) Pit-bull type dogs will have to wear a muzzle while out on the streets, and their owners will have to provide proof they dont have a criminal record involving violence. Licences for the dogs will cost $150 a year. Animal advocates complained the total costs could reach $650, too much for many low-income owners. Coderre responded that those who want dogs must assume the responsibilities that come with ownership.\n\nTo determine if a dog is of a pit-bull type, city officials said owners could call the city information line 311 and a city inspector could inform them. But Alanna Devine of the Montreal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA) said the classification of dog breeds was so complex her organizations vets could not do it. The organization has been inundated with calls from worried pet owners. Nearly one-third of the 2,000 dogs it takes in every year could fall under pit-bull typecategory, she said. Because the organization refuses to euthanize behaviourally sound animals, and it cant afford to ship hundreds of animals to other districts, it may have to stop taking in strays, she said.\n\nCouncillor Marvin Rotrand said the costs and difficulties in identifying breeds are amongthe reasons 21 states in the U.S. have barred municipalities from breed bans and cities like Edmonton and Vancouverhave repealed their bans. Rather than rush the bylaw, the city should have put the issue before a standing committee for an in-depth study and debate.\n\nThe consequences of this will be the euthanization of animals not based on their behaviour, but on their appearances, he said. LaSalle borough Mayor Manon Barbe voted against the bylaw because she said boroughs would never have themoney to enforce it. Anjou Mayor Luis Miranda said the bylaw favoured repression over prevention, and voted no.\n\nConstitutional lawyer Julius Grey said there are a number of Montreal attorneys working together to fight the bylaw, who will file a motion to stop the bylaw within weeks on the basis that it is discretionary and is not consistent with city policy. Its a terrible law.\n\nCoderre said similar bans have been successfully defended in Superior court and the Supreme Court, and he was confident Montreals would be as well.','2017-03-25 03:51:13'),(328,43,'3a7e40b988f0db8656f41eafcfd67d028cb6dac5264a8a82fb820fb37ae36142','df73aed95fba4cbfa93943c24ba23e2b','','','Montreal\'snew pit bull ban is being condemned by animal-rights activists across North America, with petitions against the policy garnering thousands of signaturesand celebrities voicing their concern.\n\nOthers arethreateningto boycott the city altogether until the ban is overturned.\n\n\"Make a commitment that you will not visit Montreal or contributeany money to their economy, until they repeal this ban,\"reads the text of a New York-based petition against the ban.\n\nThe petitionhas amassed more than 60,000 signatures.\n\n\"These are innocent dogs,\"Amy Calmann, the New York resident who started the petition, told CBC Montreal\'s Homerun. \"They have done absolutely nothing and we want the mayor to understand how serious we are, that the U.S. is standing by Montreal.\"\n\n\"We are there to do whatever we can to help.\"\n\nAnotherpetition, supported by organizations across Canada, has collected more than 150,000 signatures.\n\n\"As long as you have breed-specific language in your laws, we will boycott the city of Montreal,\" that petition reads.\n\nThe controversy also has been highlighted by prominentU.S. publications.

But owners of dogs considered pit bulls under the new guidelines would additionally be required to undergo a criminal background check, keep their dog muzzled and on a leash less than four feet long in public and pay a $150 permit fee.\n\nMayor Denis Coderre has repeatedly championed the legislation as being in the interest of public safety, but the bans numerous opponentspoint out it will result in huge numbers of innocent, friendly dogs being put to death.\n\nThere are a lot of low-income and homeless people in Montreal who simply wont be able to afford all of the criteria they need in order to get the special permit, Alanna Devine, animal advocacy director of the Montreal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, toldThe Dodo. Those dogs will have to be seized and have to be euthanized.\n\nPit bulls without a home would suffer a similar fate, as the provisions would allowno new pit bull adoptions. The groups shelters typically take in about 700 pit bull-type dogs each year, Devine said.\n\nAnd those animals cant be adopted out, which means adoptable, behaviourally sound dogs and puppies would have to be put to death, Devine told the CBC earlier this month. The Montreal SPCA said they would no longer provide dog-control services for the city if the ban goes through.\n\nThe proposed legislation defines a pit bull as an American pit bull terrier, a bull terrier, an American Staffordshire terrier, a Staffordshire bull terrier or a cross involving one of those breeds, according to CTV News. It also includes dogs that share physical characteristics with those breeds and crosses  a vague provision that opponents of the law worry could effectivelycover any large dog with short hair and a big head.\n\nOfficials announced the proposed ban in June, 10 days after a loose dog mauled 55-year-old Christiane Vadnais to death in her own backyard.

As the article noted, though, the legislation didnt require that all pit bulls in the city be put down; euthanization was an outcome that might occur in cases of disadvantaged pit bull owners not being able to afford complying with the new regulations:\n\nCity councillors in Montreal just signed a death warrant for thousands of dogs in the Canadian city. At a council meeting, legislators voted in 37 to 23 favor of breed-specific legislation, effectively outlawing any dog that resembles a pit bull  unless owners meet a strict set of conditions. Under the law, people who own dogs deemed pit bulls have until March to undergo a criminal background check and pay $150 for a special permit. Their dog will have to be sterilized, vaccinated and microchipped  as well as muzzled and on a 4-foot leash at all times in public. There are a lot of low-income and homeless people in Montreal who simply wont be able to afford all of the criteria they need in order to get the special permit, Devine told The Dodo. Those dogs will have to be seized and have to be euthanized.\n\nUnlike similar viral rumors, the Montreal pit bull ban claim was not an unfunny joke, as the CBC confirmed:\n\nNearly three months after a brutal dog attack that claimed the life of a Montreal woman, the city has passed its contentious pit bull ban. City council voted in favour of changes to its animal control bylaw that include a ban on new ownership of pit bull and pit bull-type dogs. The final vote was 37-23 in favour of the ban. The new bylaw will apply to all 19 boroughs and will define pit bulls as: Staffordshire bull terriers.\n\n American pit bull terriers.\n\n American Staffordshire terriers.\n\n Any mix with these breeds.\n\n Any dog that presents characteristics of one of those breeds. Those who now own a dog of those breeds and already live in Montreal will have to acquire a special permit in order to keep their pet by Dec. 31, 2016.\n\nThe articleadded that a minor amendment allowed for a number oflicensed pit bulls to avoid euthanization in the event of their owners deaths, and noted further provisions for dangerous dogs:\n\nThe bylaw also creates two categories of dogs of all breeds: at-risk and dangerous. At-risk dogs are those that exhibit aggressive behaviour, such as biting someone. Dangerous dogs are those that have killed someone or are deemed dangerous by an expert. No matter what, if your dog is dangerous, we will be able to act accordingly, Coderre said. An amendment to the bylaw made Tuesday morning aimed to address concerns that a pit bull would be automatically euthanized when its owner dies. The changes allow the pit bulls licence to be transferred to another person who was living at the same address, a direct family member or a spouse.\n\nThe citys move sparked a variety of reactions, including a letter from Quebecs Order of Veterinarians to members assuring them no one could be compelled to euthanize a healthy animal:\n\nQuebecs Order of Veterinarians has told members, as a bylaw banning new pit bulls in Montreal looms, that they have the right to refuse to euthanize healthy dogs, even if owners are found to have violated municipal rules. In a letter to its members, the order said veterinarians must weigh issues of animal welfare and public health in making their decisions, but ultimately, no municipal regulation or provincial legislation can obligate a veterinarian to carry out any veterinary act.\n\nThe city council referenced the 11 June 2016 mauling death of a Montreal woman as the impetus for the ban, although police said as of late September 2016 that DNA tests to affirm the involved dogs breed were still pending:\n\nThe ban on pit bulls is set to go into effect3 October 2016, and owners are required to meet licensing requirements by 31 December 2016.','2017-03-25 03:51:13'),(333,44,'3f6b5ef30ea1719ce2adc6bf06a483c0b9b9c671c4dac238e102bf8c271943e1','1fb84866741e4fbea512718767536e49','','','On 6 March 2017, NetLiveMedia.compublished an article appearing to reportthat reggae musician Buju Banton had committed suicide in his prison cell while serving out a drug trafficking sentence:\n\nMark Anthony Myrie , also known as Buju Banton, a Jamaican dancehall, ragga, and reggae musician. was found dead inside his cell of the US federal prison where he was serving his 10years sentence for drug trafficking.\n\nReports are that he was found hanging from a rope tied to the ceiling of his jail','2017-03-25 03:51:13'),(334,44,'3f6b5ef30ea1719ce2adc6bf06a483c0b9b9c671c4dac238e102bf8c271943e1','ac751b09f75d4586b60b2214ec7b2b22','','','The reggae star Buju Banton has been sentenced to 10 years in US prison for his role in a cocaine deal.

Judge Moody threw out the gun conviction, which would have extended the sentence by five years, accepting Banton was not carrying a gun and did not know his confederates were doing so. Allowing for time served and good behaviour, his attorney said he could be free in six years.\n\n\"The man is not dead.

But the singer was not present at the actual drug deal at the centre of the case, and Preston insisted Banton was just a \"big talker\". Dozens of supporters wrote letters to the court, including major reggae artists, a Jamaican government official, several of Banton\'s 15 children, and actor Danny Glover, who called Banton a \"role model, philanthropist and spiritual leader in the community\".\n\nBanton\'s defence team said they plan to appeal. \"This fight is not over,\" said attorney David Markus. \"We will keep fighting for him.

Banton blamed Jamaica\'s rife homophobia for the tone of his lyrics, saying he could be seen by his Jamaican fans to be seen as sympathetic to gay rights. \"Let\'s face the reality,\" he said in 2009. \"Whatever is said in a positive light can\'t get out.\"\n\nBanton won a Grammy award for best reggae album for his 2009 album Rasta Got Soul.','2017-03-25 03:51:13'),(335,44,'3f6b5ef30ea1719ce2adc6bf06a483c0b9b9c671c4dac238e102bf8c271943e1','2fb301d2849f402fadbc5b030487ef46','','','RUMOURS that reggae superstar Buju Banton was stabbed and killed in prison have proven untrue.\n\nSince Friday, reports emerged on social media that Banton, whose real name is Mark Anthony Myrie, had been stabbed to death during a fight in the Pinellas County Jail in Tampa, Florida.\n\nLast week as well, rumours emerged that he had committed suicide in prison.\n\nBut in a message sent to his fans worldwide through Lorna Strachan, the mother of five of his children, Banton laid fears of his mortal demise to rest.\n\n\"I don\'t like rumours about me being killed or committing suicide.

Banton has recorded pop and dance songs, as well as songs dealing with sociopolitical topics.\n\nHe released early dancehall singles in 1988 but came to prominence in 1992 with two albums, Stamina Daddy and Mr. Mention, which became the best-selling album in Jamaican history upon its release. Banton signed with major label Mercury Records and released Voice of Jamaica the following year. By the mid-1990s, Banton had converted to the Rastafari faith, and his music undertook a more spiritual tone. His 2010 album Before the Dawn won Best Reggae Album at the 53rd annual Grammy Awards.\n\nBuju Banton was born in Kingston, Jamaica in a poor neighborhood called Salt Lane. Buju is a nickname given to chubby children that means breadfruit in the language of the Maroons in Jamaican and was given to him by his mother as a child. Banton is a Jamaican word that refers to someone who is a respected storyteller, and it was adopted by Myrie in tribute to the deejay Burro Banton, whom Buju admired as a child.[2] It was Burro\'s rough gravelly vocals that Buju emulated and ultimately made his own. Buju\'s mother was a higgler, or street vendor, while his father worked as a labourer at a tile factory. He was the youngest of fifteen children born into a family that was directly descended from the Maroons of Jamaica.\n\nBanton has homes in Jamaica and Tamarac, Florida (United States).[3][4] He also has 15 children.[5][6]\n\nAs a youngster, Buju would often watch his favorite artists perform at outdoor shows and local dancehalls in Denham Town. At the age of 12, he picked up the microphone for himself and began toasting under the moniker of Gargamel, working with the Sweet Love[disambiguation needed] and Rambo Mango sound systems.[2] In 1986, he was introduced to producer Robert Ffrench by fellow deejay Clement Irie, and his first single, \"The Ruler\" was released not long afterwards in 1987.[2] This led to recording sessions with producers such as Patrick Roberts, Bunny Lee, Winston Riley, and Digital B, and in 1988, aged 15, he first recorded the song \"Boom Bye Bye\".[2]\n\nIn 1991, Buju joined Donovan Germain\'s Penthouse Records label and began a fruitful partnership with producer Dave Kelly who later launched his own Madhouse Records label.[2] Buju is one of the most popular musicians in Jamaican history, having major chart success in 1992, with \"Bogle\" and \"Love me Browning\", both massive hits in Jamaica. Controversy erupted over \"Love Me Browning\" which spoke of Banton\'s penchant for light-skinned women: \"I love my car I love my bike I love my money and ting, but most of all I love my browning.\" Some accused Banton of promoting a colonialist mindset and denigrating the beauty of dark skinned black women. In response, he released \"Love Black Woman\" which spoke of his love for dark-skinned beauties: \"Mi nuh Stop cry, fi all black women, respect all the girls dem with dark complexion\".[7] 1992 was an explosive year for Buju as he broke Bob Marley\'s record for the greatest number of number one singles in a year. Beginning with \"Woman fi Sex\", Buju\'s gruff voice dominated the Jamaican airwaves for the duration of the year. Banton\'s debut album, Mr. Mention, includes his greatest hits from that year. 1992 saw the unsanctioned re-release of \"Boom Bye Bye\", which almost destroyed his career.[2] The song was the subject of outrage in the United States and Europe, leading to Banton being dropped from the line-up of the WOMAD festival that year.[2] Banton subsequently issued a public apology.[2]\n\nNow on the major Mercury/PolyGram Records label, Banton released the hard-hitting Voice of Jamaica in 1993. The album included a number of conscious tracks. These tracks included \"Deportees\", a song which criticized those Jamaicans who went abroad but never sent money home; a remix of Little Roy\'s \"Tribal War\", a sharp condemnation of political violence; and \"Willy, Don\'t Be Silly\", which promoted safe sex and the use of contraceptives, particularly the condom, profits from which were donated to a charity supporting children with AIDS.[2] He was invited to meet Jamaican Prime Minister P. J. Patterson, and won several awards that year at the Caribbean Music Awards, the Canadian Music Awards, and the Topeka ceremony.[2]\n\nBanton\'s lyrics often dealt with violence, which he explained as reflecting the images that young Jamaicans were presented with by the news media, but the reality of Kingston\'s violence was brought home in 1993 by the murders in separate incidents of three of his friends and fellow recording artists, the deejays Pan Head and Dirtsman and singer Mickey Simpson.[2] His response was the single \"Murderer\", which condemned gun violence, going against the flow of the prevailing lyrical content in dancehall. The song inspired several clubs to stop playing songs with excessively violent subject matter. Late in 1994, Buju was also affected by the death of his friend Garnett Silk. Buju\'s transformation continued, embracing the Rastafari movement and growing dreadlocks. He joined \"conscious\" deejay Tony Rebel, Papa San, and General Degree in the Yardcore Collective. His performances and musical releases took on a more spiritual tone. Banton toured Europe and Japan, playing sold out shows.\n\n\'Til Shiloh (1995) was a very influential album, using a studio band instead of synthesized music, and marking a slight shift away from dancehall towards roots reggae for Banton. Buju claimed to have sighted Rastafari and his new album reflected these beliefs. Til Shiloh successfully blended conscious lyrics with a hard-hitting dancehall vibe. The album included earlier singles such as \"Murderer\", and \"Untold Stories\". \"Untold Stories\" revealed an entirely different Buju Banton from the one that had stormed to dancehall stardom. It is regarded by many as some of his best work, and is a staple in the Banton performance repertoire. Reminiscent in mood and delivery to \"Redemption Song\" by Bob Marley, \"Untold Stories\" won Buju Banton many favorable comparisons to the late singer. This album had a large impact on dancehall music and proved that dancehall audiences had not forgotten the message that Roots Reggae expounded with the use of \"conscious lyrics\". Dancehall music did not move away from slack and violent lyrics, but the album did pave the way for a greater spirituality within the music. In the wake of Buju\'s transformation to Rastafari, many artists, such as Capleton, converted to the faith and began to denounce violence.\n\nIn 1996, Buju contributed \"Wanna Be Loved (Desea ser Amado)\" along with Los Pericos to the Red Hot Organization\'s album Silencio=Muerte: Red Hot + Latin for the Red Hot Benefit Series. This series raises money to increase AIDS awareness.\n\nInna Heights (1997) substantially increased Banton\'s international audience as Buju explored his singing ability and recorded a number of roots-tinged tracks, including the hugely popular \"Destiny\" and \"Hills and Valleys\". The album also included collaborations with artists such as Beres Hammond and the legendary Toots Hibbert. The album was well-received but had distribution problems. Also, some fans were disappointed, having hoped for another ground-breaking album like Til Shiloh. Still, Buju\'s experimentation and soaring vocals impressed many fans and this album remains a highly regarded work.\n\nIn 1998, Buju met the punk band Rancid and recorded three tracks with them: \"Misty Days\", \"Hooligans\" and \"Life Won\'t Wait\". The latter became the title track of Rancid\'s 1998 album, Life Won\'t Wait.\n\nBuju signed with Anti- Records, a subsidiary of Brett Gurewitz\'s Epitaph records, and released Unchained Spirit in 2000.[8] The album showcased diverse musical styles, and featured guest appearances by Luciano, Morgan Heritage, Stephen Marley, and Rancid. It carried little of the roots feel heard on Til Shiloh and virtually none of the hardcore dancehall sound which had brought him to public acclaim early in his career.\n\nSeveral singles followed in the start of the new decade, which were perceived as more mellow and introspective, as opposed to the dancehall approach of his early career. In March 2003, Banton released Friends for Life, which featured more sharply political songs, including \"Mr. Nine\", an anti-gun hit.[9] The album focused on political messages regarding the African diaspora, featuring excerpts from a speech made by Marcus Garvey. \"Paid Not Played\", also featured on the album, displayed a gradual return to the themes more popular in dancehall. The album also featured some hip hop influence with the inclusion of rapper Fat Joe.\n\n2006 saw the release of the Too Bad, an album more dancehall-orientated in style. One of the slower tracks from the album, \"Driver A\", went on to become a major hit, while at the same time reviving Sly & Robbie\'s \"Taxi\" riddim.\n\nHe performed at the Cricket World Cup 2007 Opening Ceremony with Third World and Beres Hammond.\n\nThe album Rasta Got Soul was released on 21 April 2009, a date which marked the 43rd anniversary of Emperor Haile Selassie\'s visit to Jamaica in 1966. Produced by Banton, with contributions from longtime collaborators Donovan Germain, Stephen Marsden and Wyclef Jean, Rasta Got Soul was recorded over a seven-year period before its release. It went on to become his fourth Grammy nomination for Best Reggae Album in 2010.\n\nOn 13 February 2011, one day before the scheduled start of his second court trial in Tampa, Florida, Buju Banton\'s Before the Dawn album was announced as the winner of Best Reggae Album at the 53rd annual Grammy Awards.[10]\n\nA new album comprising material mainly recorded while on bail in 2011 is due to be released in Summer 2014.[11]\n\nBanton has attracted criticism over his anti-gay lyrics in his hit \"Boom Bye Bye\", written when he was 15 years old and released in 1992, contains lyrics allegedly supporting the murder of gay men.[12] In 2009 gay rights\' groups appealed to venues around the United States not to host Buju Banton.[13]\n\nIn 2007 Banton was allegedly among a number of reggae artists who signed a pledge, the Reggae Compassionate Act, created by the Stop Murder Music campaign, to refrain from performing homophobic songs or making homophobic statements,[14] but he later denied that he had made any such commitment.[15]\n\nIn December 2009 Drug Enforcement Administration agents remanded Banton to custody in Miami, where the U.S. Attorney charged him with conspiracy to distribute and possession of more than five kilograms of cocaine.[16] Banton was then moved to the Pinellas County Jail where he remained until trial. A six-day trial in Tampa, Florida was declared a mistrial on 27 September 2010, after the jury was unable to reach a unanimous decision.[17] During the trial, audio recordings were presented of Banton and a drug-dealer-turned-government-informant discussing drugs, drug prices and smuggling. Banton was also seen on a video recording meeting the informant in a police-controlled warehouse tasting cocaine from a kilogram bag.[17] The informant was reportedly paid $50,000 for his work on the case.[17] The singer was released that November on bond.[18]\n\nHe was allowed to perform one concert between trials, which was held on 16 January 2011 to a sold-out crowd in Miami.[19]\n\nOn 22 February 2011, Banton was found guilty of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute five or more kilograms of cocaine, possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug-trafficking offense and using communication wires to facilitate a drug-trafficking offense. He was found not guilty on the charge of attempted possession of five kilograms or more of cocaine.[20] Four months later, he was sentenced to ten years and one month in a federal prison for the cocaine trafficking conviction.[21] His sentencing on the firearms conviction was scheduled for 30 October 2012, but was postponed on his lawyer\'s request for an investigation of possible juror misconduct.[22] On 14 May 2015 federal prosecutors agreed to drop the firearms charges.[23]\n\nBanton is scheduled to be released in December 2018.[24]','2017-03-25 03:51:13'),(337,44,'3f6b5ef30ea1719ce2adc6bf06a483c0b9b9c671c4dac238e102bf8c271943e1','fe3b335c2f76462f9d9873ca6370e294','','','In late July 2009, Mark Myrie settled into his first-class seat on a flight from Madrid to Miami. He was getting ready to watch Ben-Hur and relax with a cocktail. As The Miami New Timestells the story, he ordered a mimosa and a man sitting next to him joked that he should order red wine instead because it is a more masculine drink. Mr. Myrie obliged. Small talk is pretty common, especially on long flights, so there was no reason for him to feel uneasy. After all, Mark was used to regularly meeting new people and living his life in the spotlight. This is because he happens to be a Grammy-award winning reggae artist who many consider to be one of the most influential Jamaican artists of the 1990s. Mark Myrie, better known by his stage name Buju Banton, is responsible for a number of chart topping hits like Driver A, Not An Easy Road, Rasta Cant Go, and Destiny.\n\nWith more than eight hours to kill as they crossed the Atlantic, Banton and his new friend drank heavily. In one instance, the flight attendants had to tell them to tone down their semi-belligerent behavior and in another, when a tipsy Buju was stopped coming back into first class from coach, the stranger vouched he was indeed supposed to be there, a gesture that made a lasting impression. His new friend told him that his name was Junior and he ran a successful fish company  but more interestingly, that he had loose ties to the reggae industry. Bantons curiosity was peaked.\n\nThe thing about meeting strangers and welcoming them into to ones life is that there is an incredible amount to gain from other peoples experiences and there is something to the notion that new friends can be made anywhere, but at the same time it is equally difficult to identify who merely sees these meetings as an opportunity. It is hard to pinpoint who is predatory. Junior for instance, is really a Colombian national named Alexander Johnson. Johnson is a U.S. government informant with a lengthy criminal record and a number of financial incentives to land a big fish so to speak  and were not talking about snapper.\n\nThe Broward-Palm Beach New Times compiled some damning numbers that relate to his life:\n\n700  Number of kilos Alex Johnson said he was caught trying to bring into Miami in 1993.\n\n 21.5  Years Johnson was sentenced to serve.\n\n 2.5  Years he actually served.\n\n 16  Years Johnson has been working as a confidential informant.\n\n $3.3 million  Approximate amount of untaxed income he has earned working as a confidential informant.\n\n $206,000  Mean per-year salary as a professional snitch.\n\n $898,500  Price he paid for a home in a western Broward County gated community.\n\n $50,000  Paycheck he earned for the bust that netted Buju Banton.\n\n $200,000  Approximate amount Johnson owed the IRS in 2010, the same year he filed for bankruptcy and testified against Buju.\n\nKeeping this in mind, it is hard to imagine that one of the most respected reggae singers of a generation  and an artist who would go on to win a Grammy the following year  would initiate a conversation with a stranger about drug trafficking. However, according to Johnson, after an intoxicated Banton saw that he had a lot of cash, which likely did not come from fishing, conversations about moving multi-kilogram amounts of cocaine began. This was later clarified during cross-examination that [Buju] never sold or bought drugs and had never wired any money to him to invest in the illicit trade. He also stated under oath that Banton had never purchased any cocaine in Panama or Colombia and that their dealings never went beyond talk.\n\nWhy a man who is a devout Rastafari and is known for songs like Sensimillia Persecution where he proudly sings, why di fightin sensimelia / mekin way fah coke to come  is having these type of conversations certainly raises questions, but it does not tell a complete story. Some people who are sympathetic to his case suggest he was presented with an opportunity (by a paid informant) to commit a crime he otherwise would not commit. Others argue that having a conversation about selling drugs and not actually capitalizing on the drug trade should not be a crime because there is no victim or public health risk. It is more of a restriction on freedom of speech than anything else. Some maintain Banton was experiencing financial strain and perhaps would have been tempted by Johnsons offer. And then there are those who believe Banton fell victim to a most human trait: big talk. These defenders insist he entertained the conversation simply to project a certain image to his new friend.\n\nDespite the variance in opinions and whatever his thinking was at the time, the U.S. Attorneys Office in Tampa, Florida felt they had enough evidence to charge him with conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute more than five kilograms of cocaine, along with a handful of other charges. The most controversial allegation related to possession of a firearm that was carried by Bantons associate, James Mack. Under the Pinkerton Rule, if Banton was found guilty of participating in a criminal conspiracy jurors could also hold him liable for Macks gun. This charge was later thrown out because of jury misconduct and as of October 2015 the juror in question was charged with contempt for doing outside legal research during the trial.\n\nOne of the more surprising aspects of Bantons case was the incredible amount of support he experienced from both fans and people in Jamaicas music industry. His most outspoken supporters included the Marley family and dancehall heavyweight Spragga Benz. Stephen Marley even went as far as putting his South Florida home up as collateral for Bantons bail and testified as a character witness in the trial. Despite the star power, jurors clung to two pieces of the prosecutors case, both of which stemmed from Banton and Johnsons conversations. Unbeknownst to him, Banton spent that entire flight talking, laughing and drinking with his new friend  who would ensure all their future meetings were under audio surveillance. And then there was also what some have called Bantons Scarface moment  a stunning video clip depicting him tasting the product.\n\nIt is worth noting that while his case was centered on cocaine, the drug that really brought down Banton was alcohol. Nearly every conversation Banton had with Johnson about drug trafficking came after heavy drinking, and even on the day they entered the police-controlled warehouse housing 20 keys, the duo met for lunch over margaritas beforehand. Banton later testified that when he was sober he felt uneasy about his friendship with Junior and even went as far as avoiding contact for four months while Johnson continued to call him regularly. The Miami New Times notes Banton was described in court as a braggart, Yet at these meetings [with Johnson], Buju stumbled on details that might be common knowledge to an international drug trafficker. He mixed up kilos with pounds and underestimated certain costs. Johnson corrected him on several points.\n\nNonetheless, there were still plenty of juicy sound bites. The line that ultimately sealed his fate was a simple, Yo, find out how much he wants. These six words made the surveillance viable evidence and ultimately became the focal point of the Feds conspiracy case. Banton was painted as someone living a dual life  a reggae-singer by day and an international drug broker by night, someone who took the stage and logged studio hours but who also went around setting up major drug deals and taking a cut of the profits. Never mind the contradictory claims that emerged numerous times throughout the trial by lead prosecutor Jim Preston alleging that Banton was also somehow seeped in financial troubles of his own. Was he a Jamaican version of George Jung or a desperate opportunist hoping for some quick cash? The government never really made that part of their case clear. And they did not have to. The video footage of him taking a taste of white powder off a long knife like he was in an episode of Narcos was particularly damning. But again, should it have been? It was so clich that it is hard to believe any experienced drug trafficker would reenact such theatrics.\n\nOn the day of the verdict, it seemed nearly anything could happen. How could someone with such an accomplished music career on the brink of a major revival get caught up in this type of conspiracy? This is a man who Stephen Marley testified under oath he has known for twenty years and never associated him with selling drugs, so why now? Why Buju?\n\nThere are no simple answers to these questions. If anything, this case highlights the pitfalls and trappings of the governments use of confidential informants and the war on drugs more broadly. Banton was ultimately convicted of three of the four charges brought against him, while his alleged co-conspirators Ian Thomas and James Mack accepted plea deals to testify against him. They were sentenced to four and six-year deals respectively, while Banton  Alexander Johnsons proverbial big fish  was slapped with ten years mandatory. His supporters have remained steadfast, however. Come January 2019, he will be released and deported back to Jamaica where reggae fans are already anticipating his arrival.\n\nIn the meantime, though, one of the islands most beloved singers has been incarcerated and silenced for spoken words of the same ilk as an entire subgenre of American music. There is no disillusion that trap musics popularity is rooted in tall tales and fabricated boasts about drug dealing. Rappers like Rick Ross have even built an entire persona around a real drug dealers legacy, yet despite the federal governments inability to prove that the claims about Banton were true or that he even stood to gain financially from the deal, he will spend a decade behind bars. Buju Banton was essentially tried and convicted for trying to impress a stranger. It is so surreal a case that it begs a question: Had it not ensnared one of reggaes most significant voices, might it otherwise have been overlooked and examined far less critically?\n\nAs Banton serves out the rest of his sentence, very little has changed in regards to the governments dependence on confidential informants in drug cases. In Palm Beach County, Florida for instance  a little more than three hours away from where Banton was arrested  a recent information breach by a spokesman for West Palm Beach Mayor Jeri Muoio revealed an unprecedented amount of information about the DEA and local departments use of C.I.s in drug stings. The revelation was so damning that local and federal officials have since admitted that numerous on-going cases were compromised and they are concerned that their informants lives could be at risk. This is but one example of how the C.I. policy can undermine its stated goals.\n\nFor Buju Banton it seems as if time has slowed. Aside from periodic news stories relating to his case, like the controversy over the juror who overstepped her boundaries by doing extrajudicial research, or the excitement that bubbles over when fans believe a new single has leaked, it is rare that he is framed as a P.O.W. in the war on drugs. Even more startling, one would think that such a high-profile case would present a prime opportunity to challenge the status quo regarding drug policy, but it has not. Many forget that he wakes up each morning in a privately operated correction facility in McRae, Georgia, where he will remain confined until the beginning of 2019.\n\nBanton once sang, Its not an easy road / Many see the glamour and the glitter / And think its a bed of rose/ who feels it knows / Lord help me sustain these blows. These words now hold eerie relevance given his incarceration. It has indeed become a very difficult road, but one that Banton has chosen to make the best of. He is currently working on his masters degree in political science and economics, and continues to write songs at a prolific rate. He is expected to have multiple albums worth of material finished by the time that he is finally released.\n\nBurnin and Lootin is a column by Robert Gordon that showcases upcoming artists, musicians, poets, and entertainers from the Caribbean.

Even more offensive than the sites deliberate misspelling of hustlers is the content: leading the news today is an article about quarterback Tony Romo supposedly being arrested for using a mens bathroom in North Carolina. (Snopes is, of course, highly suspicious of this story.) The piece clearly attempted to play off conservative sentiments toward the transgender bathroom debate, an important issue now being dragged into the mud by the grossly calculated fake viral news story. The thing thats even stranger about Huzlers, as opposed to Cartel Press, is that some of the stories are real. Huzlers mix of actual real and phony stories makes the site even more dangerous.\n\nSure, fake Pokmon Go stories might seem harmless, but Cartel Press is just part of a larger, insidious network that makes money from spreading these awful articles.

Developed apparently simultaneously by toymakers Morris Michtom in the U.S. and Richard Steiff in Germany in the early years of the 20th century, and named after President Theodore \"Teddy\" Roosevelt, the teddy bear became an iconic children\'s toy, celebrated in story, song, and film.[1] Since the creation of the first teddy bears which sought to imitate the form of real bear cubs, \"teddies\" have greatly varied in form, style and material. They have become collector\'s items, with older and rarer \"teddies\" appearing at public auctions.[2] Teddy bears are among the most popular gifts for children and are often given to adults to signify love, congratulations, or sympathy.\n\nThe name teddy bear comes from former United States President Theodore Roosevelt, who was commonly known as \"Teddy\" (though he loathed being referred to as such).[3] The name originated from an incident on a bear hunting trip in Mississippi in November 1902, to which Roosevelt was invited by Mississippi Governor Andrew H. Longino. There were several other hunters competing, and most of them had already killed an animal. A suite of Roosevelt\'s attendants, led by Holt Collier,[4] cornered, clubbed, and tied an American black bear to a willow tree after a long exhausting chase with hounds. They called Roosevelt to the site and suggested that he should shoot it. He refused to shoot the bear himself, deeming this unsportsmanlike, but instructed that the bear be killed to put it out of its misery,[5][6] and it became the topic of a political cartoon by Clifford Berryman in The Washington Post on November 16, 1902.[7] While the initial cartoon of an adult black bear lassoed by a handler and a disgusted Roosevelt had symbolic overtones, later issues of that and other Berryman cartoons made the bear smaller and cuter.[8]\n\nMorris Michtom saw the drawing of Roosevelt and was inspired to create a teddy bear. He created a tiny soft bear cub and put it in the shop window with a sign \"Teddy\'s bear,\" after sending a bear to Roosevelt and receiving permission to use his name. The toys were an immediate success and Michtom founded the Ideal Novelty and Toy Co.[6]\n\nAt the same time in Germany, the Steiff firm, unaware of Michtom\'s bear, produced a stuffed bear from Richard Steiff\'s designs. Steiff exhibited the toy at the Leipzig Toy Fair in March 1903, where it was seen by Hermann Berg, a buyer for George Borgfeldt & Company in New York (and the brother of composer Alban Berg[9]). He ordered 3000 to be sent to the United States.[10] Although Steiff\'s records show that the bears were produced, they are not recorded as arriving in the U.S., and no example of the type, \"55 PB\", has ever been seen, leading to the story that the bears were shipwrecked. However, the story is disputed - Gunther Pfieffer notes that it was only recorded in 1953 and says it is more likely that the 55 PB was not sufficiently durable to survive until the present day.[11] Although Steiff and Michtom were both making teddy bears at around the same time, neither would have known of the other\'s creation due to poor transatlantic communication.[7]\n\nNorth American educator Seymour Eaton wrote the children\'s book series The Roosevelt Bears,[12] while composer John Walter Bratton wrote an instrumental \"The Teddy Bears\' Picnic\", a \"characteristic two-step\", in 1907, which later had words written to it by lyricist Jimmy Kennedy in 1932.\n\nEarly teddy bears were made to look like real bears, with extended snouts and beady eyes. Modern teddy bears tend to have larger eyes and foreheads and smaller noses, babylike features that enhance the toy\'s cuteness. Teddy bears are also manufactured to represent different species of bear, such as polar bears and grizzly bears, as well as pandas.\n\nWhile early teddy bears were covered in tawny mohair fur, modern teddy bears are manufactured in a wide variety of commercially available fabrics, most commonly synthetic fur, but also velour, denim, cotton, satin, and canvas.\n\nCommercially made, mass-produced teddy bears are predominantly made as toys for children. These bears either have safety joints for attaching arms, legs, and heads, or else the joints are sewn and not articulated. They must have securely fastened eyes that do not pose a choking hazard for small children. These \"plush\" bears must meet a rigid standard of construction in order to be marketed to children in the United States and in the European Union.\n\nThere are also companies, like Steiff, that sell handmade collectible bears that can be purchased in stores or over the Internet. The majority of teddy bears are manufactured in countries such as China and Indonesia. A few small, single-person producers in the United States make unique, non-mass-produced teddy bears. In the United Kingdom one small, traditional teddy bear company remains, Merrythought, which was established in 1930.[13] Mohair, the fur shorn or combed from a breed of long haired goats, is woven into cloth, dyed and trimmed. Alpaca teddy bears are made from the pelt of an alpaca because the fiber is too soft to weave. In addition to mohair and alpaca, there is a huge selection of \"plush\" or synthetic fur made for the teddy bear market. Both these types of fur are commercially produced.\n\nTeddy bears are a favourite form of soft toy for amateur toy makers, with many patterns commercially produced or available online. Many \"teddies\" are home-made as gifts or for charity, while \"teddy bear artists\" often create \"teddies\" for retail, decorating them individually with commercial and recycled ornaments such as sequins, beads and ribbons . Sewn teddy bears are made from a wide range of materials including felt, cotton and velour. While many are stitched, others are made from yarn, either knitted or crocheted. Teddy bears are also made of plywood and a range of other craft materials.\n\nMichtom\'s jointed mohair Teddys bear was very popular when first designed and remains so with collectors today. Fake bears look suspiciously new and unhandled: their noses are unworn, and their seams may be thick and uneven. All Ideal bears have jointed hips, necks, and shoulders. Early examples have a characteristic American football shape and are mostly made of short gold or beige mohair plush with matching felt paws, and distinctive, sharply pointed foot pads. They have shoe-button or glass eyes, and the fur around the muzzle may be shorn. Later bears were made in a large variety of colours and types - for example, pandas - and had longer fur.\n\nOther collectible bears include ones by the Knickerbocker Toy Co. (active 1924-5) in New York, which are clearly marked with a label in the front seam. Similar to many early American bears, Knickerbocker bears usually have long bodies, small feet, and short, straight arms and legs. Their later bears can be recognized by their large inverted ears and big noses. Other collectible bears include Gund Manufacturing Co. (est. 1898), now in New York, and Hersheys bears, which were designed to promote The Hershey Companys chocolate bars.[14]\n\nRetail sales of stuffed plush animals including teddy bears totaled $1.3 billion in 2006.[15] The most commonly sold brands include Gund and Ty Inc. Brands associated with teddy bears that enjoyed strong popularity in the 1980s and 1990s are Teddy Ruxpin and Care Bears. Various TV shows and movies have a teddy bear depicted, such as Super Ted and Mr. Bean.\n\nTeddy bears have seen a resurgence in popularity as international \"do-it-yourself\" chains have opened. Among the largest and best-known are Build-A-Bear Workshop and Vermont Teddy Bear Company.\n\nSome popular mass-marketed teddy bears made today include Rupert, Sooty, Paddington, and Pudsey Bear. Books have also been written with the teddy bear featured as their main character. These include Winnie-the-Pooh, Corduroy, Teddy Tells Time, Tristan the Teddy Bear (from the Teddy Bear Tales) and Teddy Dressing.\n\nThe popularity of the toy inspired John Walter Bratton to compose the melody \"The Teddy Bears\' Picnic\" (1907). The lyrics were added in 1932 by Jimmy Kennedy.\n\nThe world\'s first teddy bear museum was set up in Petersfield, Hampshire, England, in 1984. In 1990, a similar foundation was set up in Naples, Florida, United States. These were closed in 2006 and 2005 respectively, and the bears were sold in auctions, but there are many teddy bear museums around the world today.\n\nBecause police, fire and emergency officials found that giving a teddy bear to a child during a crisis stabilized and calmed them, NAPLC created the Teddy Bear Cops program to distribute teddy bears to police, fire, and emergency officials throughout the United States, for their use in providing teddy bears to children in emergencies.[16]\n\nOn April Fools\' Day 1972, issue 90 of The Veterinary Record published a paper on the diseases of Brunus edwardii detailing common afflictions of teddy bears.[17][18]','2017-03-25 03:51:13'),(358,47,'480c77e2246c35225f7f0b44440ab92eb65c7c97f91cba87563dc39c042cc066','5cecd83e69da40a8b8499bfaf7c21442','','','Leif Erikson is regarded as the first European to land in North America, nearly 500 years before Columbus.','2017-03-25 03:51:13'),(359,47,'480c77e2246c35225f7f0b44440ab92eb65c7c97f91cba87563dc39c042cc066','58e3f657573a4180ad8bc3a93e9b5785','','','When it comes to blogging platforms,WordPress is by far the most widely used service out there. Theres many things to love about it: its easy to use, packed with advanced features, and its even free to use if youre hosting your website. While all of those are great, my favourite feature is one of the often overlooked enhancements that WordPress offers  plugins.\n\nWith tens of thousands of options to choose from, there are WordPress plugins that can add whatever functionality youre searching for and even more that can enhance your blog in ways you never imagined. Theyre a silver lining for content creators like me who want to add a feature to their site without needing to track down a developer to build out a custom solution that will take a lot of time and money. In fact, most of the plugins youll find are completely free!\n\nI originally wanted to write a Top 10 WordPress Plugins post but given that there are over 38,000 plugins out there (and counting), Im afraid Im a little too busy to narrow that list down to ten. Sorry. Instead, Id like to present all of the plugins that we currently use on the Hover blog. Some of them might be game-changers; others might have zero relevancy for your website. Either way, here are the ones that weve found to be the most useful and hopefully theyll be the same for you!\n\nMailMunchis a paid plugin but took no time at all to pay for itself. A little while back we started a blog subscription newsletter using MailChimp, which automatically sends out all the latestposts on our blog once a week. We tried plugin after plugin but either didnt like the way they looked or had difficulty integrating them into the blog.MailMunch was the one solution that both looked great and worked perfectly right from the start.\n\nThe plugin allows fora ton of customization to get you whatever subscription form youre looking for.To start, you can choose from a popover, embedded, topbar or scrollbox form:\n\nYou can then createforms using a variety of templates that can be customized to make something that is unique and consistent with your brand. You can also create different forms for mobile and desktop, ensuring that your form will be optimized for each and every device. Once created, all emails submitted will be sent over to your email marketingservice (currently MailChimp, Constant Contact, AWeber, Infusionsoft, GetResponse or Campaign Monitor), and youll even be see analytics regardinghow your forms are performing.\n\nWe started off with a scrollbox form but have since switched over to an embedded form at the bottom of posts. If youre too impatient to scroll down to the bottom , heres what ours looks like (and dont be afraid to subscribe, either):\n\nCoSchedulesClick To Tweetplugin makes blog posts more shareable and stylish at the same time. It lets notable quotes, facts or statistics stand out so they have maximum impact, and is accompanied by a button that lets readers share this info on Twitter.\n\nWhen you have a line that you think would make a great tweet, simply click the Twitter icon that will be in your editor once the plugin is installed.From there, you will be prompted to enter your text into a popup:\n\nAfter this, it will then add your message into something that looks like this:\n\n[Tweet An octopus is the size of a flea at birth.]\n\nWhen a reader clicks to tweet, a composition window will pop up to send a tweet containing your message and a link to the article. You can also customize the plugin to mention your own Twitter handle whenever a message is shared.\n\nWeve only been using this plugin for a few months now but have definitely noticed an increase in shares, all thanksto being in the right place at the right time with the right message.\n\nDisqus is one of the most commonly used commenting platforms used on blogs today and with good reason.For readers, its really simple to create an account (or login with one of their social networks) and unify the social aspectsof many of the blogs that they visit.\n\nFor bloggers, its a great way to have more control over your blog. My favourite feature is receiving an email every time a new comment is left on the blog. Disqus also does a great job of moderating potentially spammy comments, awaiting confirmation before publishing it. If its appropriate, all you need to do is reply to the email with the word approve and Disqus handles the rest.\n\nBest of all, the plugin looks great and works well on any device!\n\nGoogle Universal Analytics is a very simple and lightweight plugin that adds the JavaScript tracking code to your blog that youll need to monitor your blogs performance within Google Analytics.

In addition to looking great, there are a lot of advanced tweaks you can make including changing the colour, animating the total shares, and even faking the number that appears (if thats your thing  we dont fake our numbers though).\n\nThe plugin also has many add-ons to choose from that can add more social networks, alter the design or change the plugins functionality:\n\nWe tried a handful of other social sharing plugins and not only did Mashshare look the best, but it was also the easiest to set up and worked perfectly right from the start. Their support is also very helpful should you ever need it.\n\nMost of you probably wont have a need for MB ImageChimp RSS Feed Enhancerbut those of you who do will be very happy to have discovered it. When we set up our weekly blog RSS digest email in MailChimp, we were having difficulty pulling in the featured image of each blog post into the email.

For other uses, see Elvis (disambiguation).\n\nElvis Aaron Presley[a] (January 8, 1935  August 16, 1977) was an American singer and actor. Regarded as one of the most significant cultural icons of the 20th century, he is often referred to as the King of Rock and Roll, or simply, the King.\n\nPresley was born in Tupelo, Mississippi, as a twinless twin, and when he was 13 years old, he and his family relocated to Memphis, Tennessee. His music career began there in 1954, when he recorded a song with producer Sam Phillips at Sun Records. Accompanied by guitarist Scotty Moore and bassist Bill Black, Presley was an early popularizer of rockabilly, an uptempo, backbeat-driven fusion of country music and rhythm and blues. RCA Victor acquired his contract in a deal arranged by Colonel Tom Parker, who managed the singer for more than two decades. Presleys first RCA single, Heartbreak Hotel, was released in January 1956 and became a number-one hit in the United States. He was regarded as the leading figure of rock and roll after a series of successful network television appearances and chart-topping records. His energized interpretations of songs and sexually provocative performance style, combined with a singularly potent mix of influences across color lines that coincided with the dawn of the Civil Rights Movement, made him enormously popularand controversial.\n\nIn November 1956, he made his film debut in Love Me Tender. In 1958, he was drafted into military service. He resumed his recording career two years later, producing some of his most commercially successful work before devoting much of the 1960s to making Hollywood films and their accompanying soundtrack albums, most of which were critically derided. In 1968, following a seven-year break from live performances, he returned to the stage in the acclaimed televised comeback special Elvis, which led to an extended Las Vegas concert residency and a string of highly profitable tours. In 1973, Presley was featured in the first globally broadcast concert via satellite, Aloha from Hawaii. Several years of prescription drug abuse severely damaged his health, and he died in 1977 at the age of 42.\n\nPresley is one of the most celebrated and influential musicians of the 20th century. Commercially successful in many genres, including pop, blues and gospel, he is the best-selling solo artist in the history of recorded music,[5][6][7][8] with estimated record sales of around 600 million units worldwide.[9] He won three Grammys, also receiving the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award at age 36, and has been inducted into multiple music halls of fame.\n\nEarly years (193553)\n\n Childhood in Tupelo\n\n Present-day photograph of a whitewashed house, about 15 feet wide. Four bannistered steps in the foreground lead up to a roofed porch that holds a swing wide enough for two. The front of the house has a door and a single-paned window. The visible side of the house, about 30 feet long, has double-paned windows.\n\n Presleys birthplace in Tupelo, Mississippi\n\nPresley was born on January 8, 1935, in Tupelo, Mississippi, the son of Gladys Love (ne Smith; April 25, 1912  August 14, 1958) and Vernon Elvis Presley (April 10, 1916  June 26, 1979),[10] in the two-room shotgun house built by Vernons father in preparation for the childs birth. Jesse Garon Presley, his identical twin brother, was delivered stillborn 35 minutes before him.[11] As an only child, Presley became close to both parents and formed an especially close bond with his mother. The family attended an Assembly of God church, where he found his initial musical inspiration.[12]\n\nPresleys ancestry was primarily a Western European mix, including Scots-Irish, Scottish,[13] German,[14] and some French Norman. Gladyss great-great-grandmother, Morning Dove White, was possibly a Cherokee Native American.[15][16][b] Gladys was regarded by relatives and friends as the dominant member of the small family. Vernon moved from one odd job to the next, evidencing little ambition.[19][20] The family often relied on help from neighbors and government food assistance. The Presleys survived the F5 tornado in the 1936 TupeloGainesville tornado outbreak. In 1938, they lost their home after Vernon was found guilty of kiting a check written by the landowner, Orville S. Bean, the dairy farmer and cattle-and-hog broker for whom he then worked. He was jailed for eight months, and Gladys and Elvis moved in with relatives.[21]\n\nIn September 1941, Presley entered first grade at East Tupelo Consolidated, where his instructors regarded him as average.[22] He was encouraged to enter a singing contest after impressing his schoolteacher with a rendition of Red Foleys country song Old Shep during morning prayers. The contest, held at the Mississippi-Alabama Fair and Dairy Show on October 3, 1945, was his first public performance: dressed as a cowboy, the ten-year-old Presley stood on a chair to reach the microphone and sang Old Shep. He recalled placing fifth.[23] A few months later, Presley received his first guitar for his birthday; he had hoped for something elseby different accounts, either a bicycle or a rifle.[24][25] Over the following year, he received basic guitar lessons from two of his uncles and the new pastor at the familys church. Presley recalled, I took the guitar, and I watched people, and I learned to play a little bit. But I would never sing in public. I was very shy about it.[26]\n\nEntering a new school, Milam, for sixth grade in September 1946, Presley was regarded as a loner. The following year, he began bringing his guitar in on a daily basis. He played and sang during lunchtime, and was often teased as a trashy kid who played hillbilly music. The family was by then living in a largely African-American neighborhood.[27] A devotee of Mississippi Slims show on the Tupelo radio station WELO, Presley was described as crazy about music by Slims younger brother, a classmate of Presleys, who often took him into the station. Slim supplemented Presleys guitar tuition by demonstrating chord techniques.[28] When his protg was 12 years old, Slim scheduled him for two on-air performances. Presley was overcome by stage fright the first time, but succeeded in performing the following week.[29]\n\n Teenage life in Memphis\n\nIn November 1948, the family moved to Memphis, Tennessee. After residing for nearly a year in rooming houses, they were granted a two-bedroom apartment in the public housing complex known as the Lauderdale Courts.[30] Enrolled at L. C. Humes High School, Presley received only a C in music in eighth grade. When his music teacher told him he had no aptitude for singing, he brought in his guitar the next day and sang a recent hit, Keep Them Cold Icy Fingers Off Me, in an effort to prove otherwise. A classmate later recalled that the teacher agreed that Elvis was right when he said that she didnt appreciate his kind of singing.[31] He was usually too shy to perform openly, and was occasionally bullied by classmates who viewed him as a mamas boy.[32] In 1950, he began practicing guitar regularly under the tutelage of Jesse Lee Denson, a neighbor two-and-a-half years his senior. They and three other boysincluding two future rockabilly pioneers, brothers Dorsey and Johnny Burnetteformed a loose musical collective that played frequently around the Courts.[33] That September, he began ushering at Loews State Theater.[34] Other jobs followed, including Precision Tool, Loews again, and MARL Metal Products.[35]\n\nDuring his junior year, Presley began to stand out more among his classmates, largely because of his appearance: he grew out his sideburns and styled his hair with rose oil and Vaseline. On his own time, he would head down to Beale Street, the heart of Memphiss thriving blues scene, and gaze longingly at the wild, flashy clothes in the windows of Lansky Brothers. By his senior year, he was wearing them.[36] Overcoming his reticence about performing outside the Lauderdale Courts, he competed in Humess Annual Minstrel show in April 1953. Singing and playing guitar, he opened with Till I Waltz Again with You, a recent hit for Teresa Brewer. Presley recalled that the performance did much for his reputation: I wasnt popular in school  I failed musiconly thing I ever failed. And then they entered me in this talent show  when I came onstage I heard people kind of rumbling and whispering and so forth, cause nobody knew I even sang. It was amazing how popular I became after that.[37]\n\nPresley, who never received formal music training or learned to read music, studied and played by ear. He also frequented record stores with jukeboxes and listening booths. He knew all of Hank Snows songs,[38] and he loved records by other country singers such as Roy Acuff, Ernest Tubb, Ted Daffan, Jimmie Rodgers, Jimmie Davis, and Bob Wills.[39] The Southern gospel singer Jake Hess, one of his favorite performers, was a significant influence on his ballad-singing style.[40][41] He was a regular audience member at the monthly All-Night Singings downtown, where many of the white gospel groups that performed reflected the influence of African-American spiritual music.[42] He adored the music of black gospel singer Sister Rosetta Tharpe.[39] Like some of his peers, he may have attended blues venuesof necessity, in the segregated South, on only the nights designated for exclusively white audiences.[43] He certainly listened to the regional radio stations, such as WDIA-AM, that played race records: spirituals, blues, and the modern, backbeat-heavy sound of rhythm and blues.[44] Many of his future recordings were inspired by local African-American musicians such as Arthur Crudup and Rufus Thomas.[45][46] B.B. King recalled that he had known Presley before he was popular, when they both used to frequent Beale Street.[47] By the time he graduated from high school in June 1953, Presley had already singled out music as his future.[48][49]\n\nFirst recordings (195355)\n\n Sam Phillips and Sun Records\n\n See also: List of songs recorded by Elvis Presley on the Sun label\n\nIn August 1953, Presley walked into the offices of Sun Records. He aimed to pay for a few minutes of studio time to record a two-sided acetate disc: My Happiness[50] and Thats When Your Heartaches Begin. He would later claim that he intended the record as a gift for his mother, or that he was merely interested in what he sounded like, although there was a much cheaper, amateur record-making service at a nearby general store. Biographer Peter Guralnick argues that he chose Sun in the hope of being discovered. Asked by receptionist Marion Keisker what kind of singer he was, Presley responded, I sing all kinds. When she pressed him on who he sounded like, he repeatedly answered, I dont sound like nobody. After he recorded, Sun boss Sam Phillips asked Keisker to note down the young mans name, which she did along with her own commentary: Good ballad singer. Hold.[51]\n\nIn January 1954, Presley cut a second acetate at Sun RecordsIll Never Stand In Your Way and It Wouldnt Be the Same Without Youbut again nothing came of it.[52] Not long after, he failed an audition for a local vocal quartet, the Songfellows. He explained to his father, They told me I couldnt sing.[53] Songfellow Jim Hamill later claimed that he was turned down because he did not demonstrate an ear for harmony at the time.[54] In April, Presley began working for the Crown Electric company as a truck driver.[55] His friend Ronnie Smith, after playing a few local gigs with him, suggested he contact Eddie Bond, leader of Smiths professional band, which had an opening for a vocalist. Bond rejected him after a tryout, advising Presley to stick to truck driving because youre never going to make it as a singer.[56]\n\nPhillips, meanwhile, was always on the lookout for someone who could bring to a broader audience the sound of the black musicians on whom Sun focused. As Keisker reported, Over and over I remember Sam saying, If I could find a white man who had the Negro sound and the Negro feel, I could make a billion dollars.\'[57] In June, he acquired a demo recording of a ballad, Without You, that he thought might suit the teenage singer. Presley came by the studio, but was unable to do it justice. Despite this, Phillips asked Presley to sing as many numbers as he knew. He was sufficiently affected by what he heard to invite two local musicians, guitarist Winfield Scotty Moore and upright bass player Bill Black, to work something up with Presley for a recording session.[58]\n\nThe session, held the evening of July 5, 1954, proved entirely unfruitful until late in the night. As they were about to give up and go home, Presley took his guitar and launched into a 1946 blues number, Arthur Crudups Thats All Right. Moore recalled, All of a sudden, Elvis just started singing this song, jumping around and acting the fool, and then Bill picked up his bass, and he started acting the fool, too, and I started playing with them. Sam, I think, had the door to the control booth open  he stuck his head out and said, What are you doing? And we said, We dont know. Well, back up, he said, try to find a place to start, and do it again.\' Phillips quickly began taping; this was the sound he had been looking for.[60] Three days later, popular Memphis DJ Dewey Phillips played Thats All Right on his Red, Hot, and Blue show.[61] Listeners began phoning in, eager to find out who the singer was. The interest was such that Phillips played the record repeatedly during the last two hours of his show. Interviewing Presley on-air, Phillips asked him what high school he attended in order to clarify his color for the many callers who had assumed he was black.[50][62] During the next few days, the trio recorded a bluegrass number, Bill Monroes Blue Moon of Kentucky, again in a distinctive style and employing a jury-rigged echo effect that Sam Phillips dubbed slapback. A single was pressed with Thats All Right on the A side and Blue Moon of Kentucky on the reverse.[63]\n\n Early live performances and signing with RCA\n\nThe trio played publicly for the first time on July 17 at the Bon Air clubPresley still sporting his child-size guitar.[64] At the end of the month, they appeared at the Overton Park Shell, with Slim Whitman headlining. A combination of his strong response to rhythm and nervousness at playing before a large crowd led Presley to shake his legs as he performed: his wide-cut pants emphasized his movements, causing young women in the audience to start screaming.[65] Moore recalled, During the instrumental parts, he would back off from the mike and be playing and shaking, and the crowd would just go wild.[66] Black, a natural showman, whooped and rode his bass, hitting double licks that Presley would later remember as really a wild sound, like a jungle drum or something.[66] Soon after, Moore and Black quit their old band to play with Presley regularly, and DJ and promoter Bob Neal became the trios manager. From August through October, they played frequently at the Eagles Nest club and returned to Sun Studio for more recording sessions,[67] and Presley quickly grew more confident on stage. According to Moore, His movement was a natural thing, but he was also very conscious of what got a reaction. Hed do something one time and then he would expand on it real quick.[68] Presley made what would be his only appearance on Nashvilles Grand Ole Opry on October 2; after a polite audience response, Opry manager Jim Denny told Phillips that his singer was not bad but did not suit the program.[69] Two weeks later, Presley was booked on Louisiana Hayride, the Opry??s chief, and more adventurous, rival. The Shreveport-based show was broadcast to 198 radio stations in 28 states. Presley had another attack of nerves during the first set, which drew a muted reaction. A more composed and energetic second set inspired an enthusiastic response.[70] House drummer D. J. Fontana brought a new element, complementing Presleys movements with accented beats that he had mastered playing in strip clubs.[71] Soon after the show, the Hayride engaged Presley for a years worth of Saturday-night appearances. Trading in his old guitar for $8 (and seeing it promptly dispatched to the garbage), he purchased a Martin instrument for $175, and his trio began playing in new locales including Houston, Texas, and Texarkana, Arkansas.[72]\n\nBy early 1955, Presleys regular Hayride appearances, constant touring, and well-received record releases had made him a regional star, from Tennessee to West Texas. In January, Neal signed a formal management contract with Presley and brought the singer to the attention of Colonel Tom Parker, whom he considered the best promoter in the music business. Having successfully managed top country star Eddy Arnold, Parker was now working with the new number-one country singer, Hank Snow. Parker booked Presley on Snows February tour.[73][74] When the tour reached Odessa, Texas, a 19-year-old Roy Orbison saw Presley for the first time: His energy was incredible, his instinct was just amazing.  I just didnt know what to make of it. There was just no reference point in the culture to compare it.[38] Presley made his television debut on March 3 on the KSLA-TV broadcast of Louisiana Hayride. Soon after, he failed an audition for Arthur Godfreys Talent Scouts on the CBS television network. By August, Sun had released ten sides credited to Elvis Presley, Scotty and Bill; on the latest recordings, the trio were joined by a drummer. Some of the songs, like Thats All Right, were in what one Memphis journalist described as the R&B idiom of negro field jazz; others, like Blue Moon of Kentucky, were more in the country field, but there was a curious blending of the two different musics in both.[75] This blend of styles made it difficult for Presleys music to find radio airplay. According to Neal, many country-music disc jockeys would not play it because he sounded too much like a black artist and none of the rhythm-and-blues stations would touch him because he sounded too much like a hillbilly.[76] The blend came to be known as rockabilly. At the time, Presley was variously billed as The King of Western Bop, The Hillbilly Cat, and The Memphis Flash.[77]\n\nPresley renewed Neals management contract in August 1955, simultaneously appointing Parker as his special adviser.[78] The group maintained an extensive touring schedule throughout the second half of the year.[79] Neal recalled, It was almost frightening, the reaction that came to Elvis from the teenaged boys. So many of them, through some sort of jealousy, would practically hate him. There were occasions in some towns in Texas when wed have to be sure to have a police guard because somebodyd always try to take a crack at him. Theyd get a gang and try to waylay him or something.[80] The trio became a quartet when Hayride drummer Fontana joined as a full member. In mid-October, they played a few shows in support of Bill Haley, whose Rock Around the Clock had been a number-one hit the previous year. Haley observed that Presley had a natural feel for rhythm, and advised him to sing fewer ballads.[81]\n\nAt the Country Disc Jockey Convention in early November, Presley was voted the years most promising male artist.[82] Several record companies had by now shown interest in signing him. After three major labels made offers of up to $25,000, Parker and Phillips struck a deal with RCA Victor on November 21 to acquire Presleys Sun contract for an unprecedented $40,000.[83][c] Presley, at 20, was still a minor, so his father signed the contract.[84] Parker arranged with the owners of Hill and Range Publishing, Jean and Julian Aberbach, to create two entities, Elvis Presley Music and Gladys Music, to handle all the new material recorded by Presley. Songwriters were obliged to forgo one third of their customary royalties in exchange for having him perform their compositions.[85][d] By December, RCA had begun to heavily promote its new singer, and before months end had reissued many of his Sun recordings.[88]\n\nThis entry was posted on Friday, January 8th, 2016 at 11:10 am and is filed under Art, Freedom, Music, News, People, Spirit.

Also, she approaches this subject with a running start. As the author of The Colonel, about the carny tricks of Presleys famously Machiavellian manager, Col. Tom Parker, as well as Elvis and the Memphis Mafia, she sounds like someone well connected in the Presley world. So it is only a little bit worrisome to see her identified in the jacket copy for her new book as the first journalist to see Elvis Presley in his casket.\n\nThat whiff of morbid curiosity turns out to be determinative. So does the genesis of Baby, Lets Play House: Ms. Nash acknowledges that she initially wrote a women-oriented article for Ladies Home Journal and then decided to expand it. Thus armed with what she all too aptly calls an oral history of some of the women in Elviss life, Ms. Nash began padding her story with three kinds of material: her own legitimate interviews (some with women still pining for Elvis 50 years after their fateful encounters), secondhand gossip (from self-serving memoirs and fan publications) and psychobabble. Cobbled together, these elements led her along Presleys long, winding trail from babes to baby sitters as his life spiraled into sad decline.\n\nBaby, Lets Play House is abundantly illustrated with pictures of Presley with his girlfriends. And the pictures tell a powerful story. He worked his way through a lifetimes worth of women who looked like his brown-haired, soulful-eyed mother, Gladys. At first they were girls next door. Then, though still from the same cookie cutter, they became ever more beautiful as Elviss star rose, to the point where he paired up with women almost as good-looking as he was.\n\nAfter Gladys died in 1958, her distraught son began going off the rails, and the women become less and less suitable for bringing home to Mother. The last photos of Elvis show him with a glazed John Belushi look and not much visible awareness of his female companions, whoever they happen to be.\n\nMs. Nash tells a long, repetitive and dirt-digging version of that dramatic tale. Her central premise, supplied by Peter O. Whitmer (The Inner Elvis) in his capacity as this books resident psychologist and buttressed by terms like individuate, stuck grief, sexual dimorphism and estrogen-androgen balance, is that Presleys loss of a twin brother at birth set him on a lifelong search for companionship he could never truly find and that his extreme closeness to his mother left no room for other adult women.\n\nUsing details too tawdry for even the most voyeuristic fans, the author offers evidence of her subjects arrested sexual development, physical insecurities and general predilection for the 14-year-old girls who struck him as unthreatening. Sometimes he really did throw pajama parties and teach girls how to put on eye makeup and style their hair.\n\nSome details in Baby, Lets Play House invoke the bottom-feeding biographical style of Albert Goldman. And Ms. Nash, in playing to the rubbernecking crowd, is not shy about using Mr. Goldman as a source. She also replays the memories of each girlfriend who believed herself to be Elviss true love (I was the one who got away), the creative stylings of too many ghostwriters and the fairy-tale tone of Priscilla Presley, Elviss wife. (I thought I was living inside a dream. Except the dream had come true. I had come home with Elvis.) Although Ms. Nash usually plays fair with attributions, she sometimes creates the misimpression that material borrowed from fan Web sites is a) current and b) her own.\n\nBut she has done her own dogged research too. And some of it is memorably succinct and tough. Consider this near haiku from Patti Parry, the lone female buddy in Elviss inner circle: Nineteen-year-old truck driver becomes superstar and super stud, which he wasnt. Or this from Lamar Fike, one of his closest associates: Ill give you Elviss relationship with Priscilla in a nutshell. You create a statue. And then you get tired of looking at it. Or from Sheila Ryan Caan, one of the rare girlfriends who felt free to tease Elvis about his sartorial style: Does Cruella know you have her cape tonight?\n\nRegardless of how Ms. Nash accrued and assembled this material, she manages to collect all the madness, badness and sadness of the Elvis myth in one exhaustive and (lets face it) embarrassingly tempting volume. Though she is sure to be excoriated for leaving the emperor unclothed, she also writes with admiration. And after presenting an endless-seeming parade of consorts (he had declined from young starlets to young bank tellers in his final months), Ms. Nash gets the last word on girl-chasing from Elvis at his weariest.\n\nWhy the hell do you put up with her? Billy Smith, Presleys cousin and entourage member, tells Ms. Nash that he asked Elvis about Ginger Alden, the consort who was asleep in the next room when he died. Said the King, Im just getting too old and tired to train another one.

Elvis The King of Rock \'n\' Roll moves up 7 spots to #15 (85th week on the chart; HP #4; 2xP) and \'68 Comeback Special re-enters at #39 (HP #1; 5xP). (News, Source: ARIA)\n\nhas to rival the equally delectable Ann-Margret, Michele Carey (Live A Little, Love A Little) and Ina Balin (Charro) as Elviss sexiest co-star!\n\nElvis as singing rodeo star, Lonnie Beale, who moonlights in his spare time at a beauty ranch for rich and bored women is hardly inspiring and by the second half of the film, the humour has slid into slapstick territory. That the two writers, Elwood Ullman and Edward Bernds, are better known for their work on films for acts such as The Three Stooges, is a strong indicator of what the studio wanted for this Presley vehicle. This is not all bad news though.\n\nThe supporting cast is solid without being outstanding. The inclusion of veterans Julie Adams and western star Bill Williams mixed with other familiar faces including Mullaney and Will Hutchins (TVs Sugarfoot and who would later play Elvis sidekick in the Prince and the Pauper take off in another much maligned but underrated film, Clambake) helps keep the film afloat.\n\nThe script, which is deliberately B grade is actually not that bad and at times downright hilarious (if silly), particularly scenes in the hands of Jack Mullaney who is wonderfully cast as the hapless Stanley Potter and Edward Faulkner as the self-absorbed but well meaning Brad Bentley. Thanks to the professionalism of the cast some scenes with very ordinary lines of dialogue actually work:\n\nThe soundtrack to Tickle Me is actually one of the Kings strongest with all 9 songs taken from his back catalogue, notably several tracks from his critically lauded album, Elvis Is Back.\n\nAs legend has it, Tickle Me, gave Allied Artists at least a temporary reprieve from going into receivership. For me, there are much worse Elvis films than this one. Paradise, Hawaiian Style and Harum Scarum spring immediately to mind.\n\nOverall, Tickle Me is a fun movie to while away 90 minutes of ones time. The music is good, there are silly but funny moments, and the scenery of the primary male and female stars is more than attractive. This film is not as bad as some critics suggest! Tickle Me has no pretensions to be anything other than what it is. Enjoy it on this basis.\n\nTickle Me  the soundtrack: In his book, Elvis Presley The Complete Guide to His Music (Omnibus Press, 2004), author John Robertson wrote this about the Tickle Me soundtrack:\n\nRodeos, buried treasure, ghosts  all in the same forgettable movie. Tickle Me was Elviss first film for Allied artists, and also his last. It was memorable for quite another reason, though: for the only time, no new songs were prepared for the soundtrack. Instead, nine previously released recordings were introduced into the plot, among them such highlights of 1960s Elvis Is Back LP as Dirty, Dirty Feeling and It Feels So Right. RCA included five of the songs on a soundtrack EP, then bowed to public demand in and slapped the four leftovers onto a second extended-play single. But all tracks are now available on other CDs.\n\nRead EIN\'s review of the FTD Tickle Me release\n\nRead more about Elvis\' films on EIN\'s Celluloid Elvis page\n\nElvis heads list of famous ex-truckers: 1 Elvis Presley - Here is the moment you\'ve been waiting at least two minutes for - Truck& Driver\'s most famous ex-trucker is The King, Elvis Presley.\n\nBefore he rose to the status of rock royalty, Elvis drove trucks for a living. It may well have been behind the wheel that Elvis learned his trade - crooning and eating peanut butter. It is certain that his ducktail hairstyle was the fashion for lorry drivers of the Deep South.\n\nApparently Elvis was told at one audition to stick to the day job but, having come fifth in a singing competition as a youngster and winning $5, he was not to be discouraged. Honing his skills in the laundry room of a Memphis public housing development, the shy boy continued to play country music (he was then known as \'The Hillbilly Cat\') and express himself through his guitar.\n\nAppropriately he drove for the Crown Electric Company, a Maryland-based firm that still exists today. Elvis\'s first big commercial recording was in 1956 with the song Heartbreak Hotel; from there he left the open road behind him and went on to revolutionise music and culture.\n\nBesides the fact that all three are dead, Maestro David Ramadanoff had one reason for putting Michael Daughertys Dead Elvis and Mozarts Serenade in D major K. 239 (Serenata notturna) together with Beethovens Seventh Symphony on the Vallejo Symphony\'s Jan. 9 concert.\n\nThe first half of the program really is an opportunity to feature a number of players from the orchestra as soloists, he explained by phone.\n\nIts fun, colorful, and very technically challenging for everyone who plays it because its so fast, says Ramadanoff. It also demands lots of pyrotechnics from a bassoonist willing to try to look as well as play the part.\n\nIn addition to providing contrast with its full orchestra, Ramadanoff feels that Beethovens Symphony No. 7 in A Major fits the bill because of its liveliness.\n\nAll throughout the symphony, he says, Beethoven chooses certain figures that really push the music along. The scherzo is one of the fastest he ever wrote, and the final movement incredibly propulsive.\n\nIve known many of them since my days as conductor of the San Francisco Conservatory of Music Orchestra, he says, when they were either just graduating or first starting in the Freeway Philharmonic. We have a special chemistry. These folks know each other very well, and the small combo were using in the first half really likes working together and with me. We all feel were making good music together.\n\nThe Vallejo Symphony performs in Hogan Auditorium, (corner of ) in on Saturday, January 9 at 8:00 p.m. For tickets, call 707-643-4441.\n\nThe association\'s special award, the Wyatt Award (named for Nashville Tennessean film critic Gene Wyatt, who died in 2004), went to \"That Evening Sun,\" which screened Oct. 8 at the Indie Memphis Film Festival. Directed by Scott Teems, \"That Evening Sun\" stars Hal Holbrook as a stubborn octogenarian who leaves a retirement facility to move back to his rural home even after it has been occupied by a new family.\n\nThe Wyatt runner-up was \"Goodbye Solo,\" which stars former longtime Memphian and Elvis associate Red West as a man planning his suicide. In its fifth year, the Wyatt honors the film that \"best embodies the essence of the South.\" Past Wyatt winners include \"Junebug\"; \"Dixie Chicks: Shut Up and Sing\"; \"Waitress\"; and \"Shotgun Stories.\"\n\nThis year, 44 members voted in the Southeastern Film Critics Association poll.

(News: Source: EP Gold/Elvis News)\n\nPositive media reaction to \"Viva Elvis\": EPE published these on the official website:\n\nFormal reviews of the show wont take place until February, but here is how the media characterized the show following the December 15th press conference and Viva Elvis preview. \n\n \n\n \n\n A retro-contemporized tribute that unfolds like a live concert. - The Los Angeles Times \n\n \n\n If the early buzz is true, Viva Elvis will do for the King of Rock \'n\' Roll what Love did for the Beatles. That is, combine the Cirque du Soleil brand with one of the most iconic musicians of all time, creating a must-see Las Vegas strip attraction. - FOX News \n\n \n\n My prediction from that first number is that Viva Elvis could be Cirque\'s biggest hit. - @Robin_Leach via Twitter\n\nMulti-Grammy Award winning Elvis? Two or three Grammys and all for Gospel Records is not something they should be crowing about. Not when the man changed the culture of the world in the 50\'s and then went on to record some of the classic Rock N\' Roll records in history and in fact the first ones ever and not one was awarded a Grammy. 51 number one records worldwide and sold over one Billion and not one Grammy for those records.\n\nTimed closely to coincide with the 75th anniversary of Elvis Presley\'s birth, Shout! Factory, in association with dick\n\nDirected by John Carpenter, the biopic of Elvis stars Kurt Russell and features the country music hitmaker Ronnie McDowell re-creating Presley\'s signature vocals. Tracing Presley\'s life from his impoverished childhood to his meteoric rise to stardom to his triumphant return to Las Vegas, this film boasts an all-star ensemble including Academy Award winner Shelley Winters (A Place In The Sun) as Elvis\' mother Gladys; Season Hubley (All My Children) as his wife Priscilla; Kurt Russell\'s real-life father Bing Russell (The Magnificent Seven) as Elvis\'s father Vernon Presley; Pat Hingle (Batman) as Colonel Tom Parker; Robert Gray (Murder She Wrote) as Red West; Golden Globe nominee Joe Mantegna (Searching for Bobby Fischer) as Memphis mafia member Joe Esposito; and Golden Globe nominee Ed Begley Jr. (St. Elsewhere) as D.J. Fontana. (News, Source: Anthony Britch/Shout! Factory)\n\nDisc one covers his rise to fame; 1953-1957. The set begins with his 1953 recording of My Happiness which was a present for his mother and well worth its $4.00 investment. His mid-fifties Sun material quickly follows as songs such as Thats All Right, Baby Lets Play House, Blue Moon Of Kentucky, and Mystery Train would jump start his career in the south and pave his way to being signed by the RCA label. By 1957 Heartbreak Hotel, Jailhouse Rock, All Shook Up, Hound Dog, (Let Me Be Your) Teddy Bear, Too Much, I Want You, I Need You, I Love You, and Dont had all topped the singles charts in the United States and made him a star.\n\nDisc two is the strongest from beginning to end as it culls the best of his 1958-1962 material. Tracks such as Stuck On You, Its Now Or Never, Are You Lonesome Tonight, Cant Help Falling In Love, and Return To Sender are interspersed with some lesser known material including Thrill Of Your Love, Doin The Best I Can, I Feel So Bad, and Pocketful Of Rainbows.\n\nDisc three, 1963-1969, wisely avoids most of his soundtrack material and concentrates on the series of strong singles that he issued during this period of his career. Guitar Man, U.S. Male, Dont Cry Daddy, and Kentucky Rain may not have reached the top of the charts but they remain some of the best songs in his catalogue. Viva , How Great Thou Art and perennial favorites In The Ghetto and Suspicious Minds serve to enhance this disc.\n\nThe fourth disc, 1970-1977, is the weakest as it presents material from the last part of his career, which is hit or miss. The live material just does not measure up and while Way Down, Burning Love, andPromised Land may be listenable, overall this is the disc I will return too least often.\n\nElvis 75: Good Rockin Tonight may not be for everyone but it is a fine addition to the Elvis Presley legacy. If you have avoided his box sets in the past or are a fan who must have everything then this is a must purchase.\n\nElvis \'75: Good Rockin\' Tonight is now out in the US.\n\nve release in most other countries by January 2010.\n\nFor people over 40, the idea of the l\'inoxydable (rustproof) Johnniein intensive care has been a sharp reminder of their own mortality. Sarkozy explained Johnny\'s role in the French collective memory to foreigners in last Friday. He told an EU summit press conference that he was relieved to hear that the singerwas recovering from what we are told was an infected spine.His illness \"provokes great emotion in because he\'s a much-loved man and, for each of us, he represents a bit of our personal history: memories, feelings, songs, music,\" Sarkozy said.\n\nThe Hallyday health storyis in keeping with the larger-than-lifepersona.He has exhausted himself this year with a gruelling seven-month \"farewell\" tour which he is still supposed to resume on January 8. He went into the Parc Monceau clinic in for an operation on a slipped disk late last month and flew only four days later to . He collapsedsoon after landing.Jean-Claude Camus, his impresario, accused Stphane Delajoux, a young show-biz surgeon who operated on his disk, of \"massacring\" Hallyday. Within hours, Delajoux was beaten up. His lawyer accused the media of effectivelyhaving him lynched.\n\nLike much around the Hallyday story, we have no idea what the attack was about. Secrecy has surrounded his hospital stay, with not a single medical communiqu on his condition. Internet rumours say of course that he is dead. News has trickled out via Camus, Laeticia, his latest young wife [above], and celebrity friends who have visited him. The latest to fly out was Nathalie Baye, the actress, with whom he had a daughter.\n\nFingers are pointing at Camus, a tough businessman, for pushingHallyday too hard. Despite his lifetime sale of over 100 million records, Hallyday is said to need the money to pay past bills and keep his entourage in the luxury to which they are accustomed. Like many stars before him, Hallyday has a reputation for beingmanipulated by the people around him. He is said to havelost a lot of money over the years. The public is also not told why \'s national institution divides his non-working time between homes in LA, Saint Barts\' in the Caribbean and . The reason is that he needs to stay out of to retain non-resident status to avoid income tax. He has been domiciled in for the past threeyears.\n\nJohnnysaid recently that he was wearyof his role as the guitar-slinging, Harley-drivingrebel. \"I have had enough playing Johnny Hallyday,\" he said at the outset of his tour last May. \"I want more and more to be Jean-Philippe Smet.\"\n\nFranck Nouchi, a Le Monde columnist, made agood point this afternoon. The \"sacred union\" of the nation at Johnny\'s bedside says more about than all Sarkozy\'s great debate over the country\'s identity, Nouchi wrote.\n\nThe insurance experts and lawyers are now preparing for battle over the big losses expected from the likely cancellation of the next stretch of his booked-out farewell tour. Will the surgeon be blamed or will Johnny be deemed irresponsible for taking a flight straight after an operation?

It seems their brain cells are lacking because when they do something big they actually end up doing it small and not newsworthy or profitable. I just saw a cool replica of Elvis\' pink cadillac in a new diecast series called \"Elvis Motor Classics\". But instead of doing a whole set of the famous cars at they do a small irrelevant set of only two. WTF? Do they not realise what they\'re missing out on in both financially and popularity and what a lost opportunity this is? Opposite: Elvis\'s uncle Travis Smith with fans at the Graceland gates in 1957 They could have done an entire set based around his private collection and vehicles from his famous movies and even a replica of the two private jets, the Lisa Marie and the other smaller plane. Instead they go the cheapest route. \n\n \n\n Diecast models are BIG business for all ages. They could have sold them in stores across They could have done an entire set based around his private collection and vehicles from his famous movies and even a replica of the two private jets, the Lisa Marie and the other smaller plane. Instead they go the cheapest route.Diecast models are BIG business for all ages. They could have sold them in stores across and kids and non fans alike would have bought them mainly because of their detail and uniqueness. Older men would have wanted them who collect diecast models. I collect them and I know for a fact that I would have bought had they done it properly. EPE could have made a freaking killing off of them and made as much in revenue than what they do on ticket sales to . What morons!!\n\n \n\n Sorry for venting but to me, this is a travesty. It\'s not the first time those idiots have missed out on a very good and positive opportunity either. It\'s a common thing with them. They\'re website isn\'t even up to modern day standards even. Like them, it\'s stuck in the past. Most sites today have hi-tech interactive activities for kids and adults to learn and discover things and be educated. Not the case with EPE. They care mroe about selling fake a$$ jumpsuits and wigs with goofy looking glasses on their site. \n\n \n\n Don\'t even get me started on their outdated rundown 20th century looking facilities. They keep talking about what they plan to do. Well, if you Google EPE and expansion you will find articles dating back to 1992 about wanting to expand and build a new museum. 18 years later no expansion and no new museum. I was disappointed at how their facilities lacked 21th century technology and nothing to do once you\'ve seen the mansion and the cars and planes. No nightlife, no entertainment, no restuarant even. Nothing! For to be such a big attraction it sure doesn\'t offer half as much as it should.\n\n \n\n Sillerman better take the wheel soon and clean house at EPE and get rid of those out of touch imcompetent floons that run the estate and replace them with young smart vibrant minds that actually know it\'s about to be 2010 not 1910 before it\'s too late or he\'ll lose out more than the fans will. \n\n \n\n isn\'t the only thing that needs a major overhaul, so does the entire staff at EPE, from CEO to marketers to pulbic speakers. ALLC,I understand your frustration with EPE and whilst I agree mainly with your assumptions there are are some good people there. Can I suggest that if you have any marketing ideas you address them to Scott Williams. His e-mail address is: swilliams@elvis.com I have found him to be very helpful and always get a reply to my e-mails which is more than can be said from 99% of the staff there.

As if he ever went away!: Ernst Jorgensen is calling from a farmhouse an hour outside Copenhagen to talk about his passion. For the past two decades he has been curator of the Elvis Presley vault  no simple task at first after decades of exploiting the recordings. He helped get the vault organized and worked with RCA Records to do releases that make sense. So whats the sense in the latest  Elvis 75: Good Rockin Tonight, 100 Elvis cuts on a four-disc box set? Ernst Jorgensen explains... Elvis\' music on this boxhas been remastered yet again. Could a casual fan tell the difference? If you had the ideal way to listen to this youd have it in the recording studio with the actual analog tape playing back on the machine it was recorded on and the speakers it was recorded on. This is the constant struggle for us, to get closer and closer to that. With the new technology we can transfer the tape with a higher resolution. We can work with it in 24-bit, 32-bit environment, and make sure we get as close to the exact sound as the analog tape.  Weve taken every one of Elvis 711 masters and tried to do a better job on them. On some the improvement will be more important than on others. It all depends on how well we did before. Its interesting to do it. Its a joy to do it. I think that most people, unless they sit there and A/B it versus what they had before, theyre just gonna say Wow, this sounds great. Whats the purpose in putting out all this music again? Were a little bit on a mission. We always try to see if we can get new devotees for our little project, get people to look beyond the 30 number-one hits. This box set is really what thats all about. Maybe its even more about that than it is about getting a better sound.  it gives us the opportunity to put a package out thats tempting because it has all the hits. And then fansgo in  and find all these songs that are nowhere near as famous but that we think are aesthetically just as important and see if we can get people excited about the Elvis they didnt know. What songs in particular? Some of Elvis best-known songs in America like Love Me Tender, Hound Dog, Dont Be Cruel  theyve sold 40 million copies in the U.S. Havent you then covered everything? But if you look at his Sun recordings, to many people  those are some of the greatest of his recordings. Sales figures on those titles are like three, four, five million. Theres plenty of room for our mission to get more people to look beyond the hits. Thats true. Some people know My Baby Left Me only through the Creedence Clearwater Revival version, not Elvis. Yep. Thats a very good example. If you listen to Heartbreak Hotel that was the fist hit on RCA, thats about the most unusual hit you could ever imagine  a slow, bluesy song with a morbid theme. That became a hit. Who could have expected that? But during the same week he recorded My Baby Left Me and One-Sided Love Affair. This is the kick I get from it  to choose 100 songs where 30 or 40 of them are already major hits. You have to choose Lawdy Miss Clawdy or Shake Rattle and Roll  the idea of having people listening to songs they dont know that well.thats the fun part of it. Ernst Jorgensen in the vault in 1989....a great way NOT to preserve music history! What\'s the state of the Elvistape vault  is it Beatles-neat or a total mess? It was somewhere in the middle when I started, but pretty good today. Wed had a lot of tapes that developed legs and walked away from our various premises. Weve gotten them back. We found out where they disappeared, and let them know they needed to come back. By 2001, 2002 we had all the masters that could be found in our vaults. But it was a long, long process of detective work. We had to go back and find out when tapes got lost, who was around in those days, what studios were used, then start hunting down people. What\'s the condition of the tapes? How are they holding up? Theres a problem with tapes in the mid to late 70s. I think Ampex tapes were one of the brands that were really, really bad. We realized very early on  thats not what was missing in our vaults. The tapes that disappeared seemed to be the historically more interesting tapes like the master of Heartbreak Hotel. We made safeties back then. I dont think that our 70s tapes are as bad as the average. Some of our multi-tracks need baking every time we play them. In general were doing well with the Elvis tapes. There was a tendency earlier on in the early days of CDs where people put whatever master was there that included a certain track instead of going back and finding the originals. There was a sloppiness during a decade or two where business didnt prioritize catalog releases. They didnt go that extra mile to find the generation before.\" \"Some of the Sun masters dont exist and seem to have never existed. When RCA took over Sun we got tapes from Sam Phillips but there were at least four songs where we never got a tape. What we put out on record in the 50s was taken from 45s and 78s. I love Sam Phillips, I think hes a genius, but he was a mess with his tapes! Tape was expensive. They recorded over it because money was scarce at the time. By the mid-50s RCA was a major record company and they had procedures on how to do things that ensured it was done properly. What happened later was the tapes were not controlled well enough and were allowed to leave the house. The vault after being cleaned up....a much better way to preserve musc history Are you still finding Elvis rarities? If we were to find anything today it may be a private recording of Elvis. Im dreaming here, but if somebody said they had tape for two or three of Elvis Louisiana Hayride performances back in 55, thatd be wonderful. In principal that could happen. From the RCA standpoints there are no sessions where we dont have the tapes or the masters. I cant see wed ever find anything on that level. Ten or 15 years ago if you found rare recordings by an artist like Elvis or the Beatles it would be a sensation in the media when it came out. Today if we would find two Elvis songs people havent heard before it wouldnt be. Because its been done so many times. Weve found so many rare releases its like the \'Cry wolf\' logic. Is the world really gonna go nuts hearing Elvis sing Rock Around the Clock at the Louisiana Hayride in 1955? It reminds me of the Jimi Hendrix estate, where a lot of shoddy releases followed his death, but these days its controlled better. Thats a very good point. When I came in in the late 80s there was market research done at RCA, which was a pretty hip thing to do in the 80s. They went out and defined who the Elvis customer was  a woman between 35 and 55, a housewife, married to a blue-collar worker, living in the south, not willing to pay more than $8 for an Elvis item. One of the first things we did was a box set called The King of Rock n Roll and sold it for $80 dollars, which was 10 times what the market research said we should do. And it sold 400,000 boxes in America. The one thing we learned from that was the perception of who likes Elvis is utterly wrong.

After he was revived from a first artificial coma yesterday, his entourage issued a positive bulletin. However, his condition continues to cause concern and he was placed in another induced coma last night. Mr Hallyday\'s long-standing manager and producer, Jean-Claude Camus, told the French radio station RTL yesterday that legal action was possible against the famous-but-controversial surgeon who operated on Mr Hallyday for an aggravated slipped disc in Paris last month.\n\n\"We were told it had been a massacre,\" he said. \"The Los Angeles surgeons were appalled. There is talk of legal action.\"\n\nDr Delajoux is credited with saving the life of the actress Charlotte Gainsbourg  daughter of the French singer Serge Gainsbourg and British actress Jane Birkin  after she suffered a severe head injury in a waterskiing accident in 2007.

Dr Delajoux also has a conviction for fraud, after falsifying a medical insurance claim in 2005. He was given a suspended jail sentence.\n\nOlivier Metzner, the lawyer for the main French doctors\' association, L\'Ordre des Mdcins, said yesterday that Dr Delajoux has often been disciplined by the association. Dr Delajoux has been accused, among other things, of failing to apply a \"drain\" to Mr Hallyday\'s back to evacuate possible infectious material.\n\nHis lawyer, David Koubbi, said yesterday that the Paris operation had been a \"complete success\" and there had been no need for a drain.\n\nHallyday, known as the \"French Elvis\", has often been criticidsed by music journalists but has an incredible stage presence and is France\'s moist successful musical star of the past 50 years.

The light fading, the sitter grew concerned that the boy would panic. But little Donny Trump kept walking into the gathering darkness.\n\nIn elementary school, Donny impressed classmates with his athleticism, shenanigans and refusal to acknowledge mistakes, even one so trivial as misidentifying a popular professional wrestler. No matter his pals ridicule, one recalled, he doubled down, insisting wrestler Antonino Roccas name was Rocky Antonino.\n\nAt the military academy where he attended high school, Donny grew taller, more muscular and tougher. Struck with a broomstick during a fight, he tried to push a fellow cadet out a second-floor window, only to be thwarted when two other students intervened.\n\nLong before he attained vast wealth and far-reaching fame, Donald J. Trump left an indelible impression in the prosperous Queens neighborhood where he evolved from a mischievous, incorrigible boy into a swaggering young man.\n\nHe was Trump in miniature, an embryonic version of the bombastic, flamboyant candidate who has dominated the 2016 presidential race, more than three dozen of his childhood friends, classmates and neighbors said in interviews. Even Trump has acknowledged the similarities between himself as an adult and when he was the boy whom friends alternately referred to as Donny, The Trumpet and Flat Top (for his hair).\n\nWhen I look at myself in the first grade and I look at myself now, Im basically the same, the 70-year-old presumptive Republican nominee once told a biographer. The temperament is not that different.\n\nHis face crowned by a striking blond pompadour, young Donald commanded attention with his playground taunts, classroom disruptions and distinctive countenance, even then his lips pursed in a way that would inspire future mimics. Taller than his classmates, he exuded an easy confidence and independence.\n\nWho could forget him? said Ann Trees, 82, who taught at Kew-Forest School, where Trump was a student through seventh grade. He was headstrong and determined. He would sit with his arms folded with this look on his face  I use the word surly  almost daring you to say one thing or another that wouldnt settle with him.\n\nThis story is based on reporting for Trump Revealed, a broad, comprehensive examination of the life of the presumptive Republican nominee for president. The biography, written by Post reporters Michael Kranish and Marc Fisher in a collaboration with more than two dozen Post reporters, researchers and editors, is scheduled to be published by Scribner on Aug. 23.\n\nA fierce competitor, Trump could erupt in anger, pummeling another boy or smashing a baseball bat if he made an out, two childhood neighbors said. In school, he misbehaved so often that his initials became his friends shorthand for detention.\n\nHis father Fred C. Trumps success as a real estate developer paid for the private schools, limousines and 23-room house to which Donald and his four siblings grew accustomed. Yet Donald also learned that comfort and security could be fleeting if his grades and behavior were poor. When Donald was 13, his father abruptly sent him to a military boarding school, where instructors struck him if he misbehaved and the requirements included daily inspections and strict curfews.\n\nHe was essentially banished from the family home, said his biographer, Michael DAntonio. He hadnt known anything but living with his family in a luxurious setting, and all of a sudden hes sent away. Thats a rough way to start out in life.\n\nTrump, in an interview with The Washington Post, described his years at the military academy in rosier terms, saying his parents thought the discipline would be good for me because I was rambunctious.\n\nI was a wise guy, and they wanted to get me in line, he said. Thinking back, it was a very positive influence.\n\nIf nothing else, the military academy taught young Donald a lesson that would prove valuable in adulthood as he navigated two divorces, bankruptcy and regular spasms of bad publicity: No matter the crisis, he could prevail.\n\nThe home that stood out\n\nIn Jamaica Estates, the Queens neighborhood where Donald grew up, the Trumps house on Midland Parkway was distinct, if not for its size then for what it suggested about the wealth of its builder, Fred Trump.\n\nSeventeen brick steps led up a sloping hill to the entrance, which was framed by a Colonial-style portico, a stained-glass crest and six white columns. Two Cadillacs were in the driveway, their license plates bearing their owners initials, FCT1 and FCT2.\n\nNo one had individualized license plates in those days, said Ann Rudovsky, who grew up nearby. Everyone talked about the Trumps because of the house and the cars.\n\nUnlike most families in the neighborhood, the Trumps had a cook, a chauffeur and an intercom system. Their color television, a rarity at the time, was among the Trumps accoutrements that most impressed Mark Golding, Donalds childhood friend.\n\nHe had the most amazing train set, recalled Golding, a lawyer in Portland, Ore. He had all these special gadgets and gates and switches, more extensive than anything Id seen. I was very envious.\n\nDonald is the fourth of Fred and Mary Trumps five children, the first of whom, Fred Jr., a gregarious airline pilot, suffered from alcoholism and died at the age of 43. Maryanne Trump, Donalds older sister, became a U.S. Appeals Court judge. Another sister, Elizabeth, was an administrative secretary. His younger brother, Robert, went into business.\n\nTheir mother, Mary, a Scottish immigrant, relished attention, thrusting herself to the center of social gatherings. She also loved pageantry, spending hours watching on television the 1953 coronation of Queen Elizabeth.\n\nMary Trump suffered a hemorrhage after Roberts birth that forced doctors to perform an emergency hysterectomy. She also developed an abdominal infection that required several more surgeries, during which she nearly died.\n\nAt one point, Fred Trump informed his daughter that her mother wasnt expected to live, but I should go to school and hed call me if anything changed, Maryanne Trump once told Gwenda Blair, who authored a detailed history of the family. Thats right  go to school as usual!\n\nMaryanne Trump declined to comment for this article except to say, Hes still a simple boy from Queens. You can quote me on that. Neither Elizabeth nor Robert Trump responded to messages.\n\nFred Trump, with his thick mustache and hair combed back, was a stern, formal man who insisted on wearing a tie and jacket at home. A conservative Republican who admired Barry Goldwater, Fred Trump and his wife forbade their children from cursing, calling each other by nicknames and wearing lipstick.\n\nFred Trump was really very kind of tightfisted, said Peter Brant, a newsprint magnate who was among Donalds closest childhood friends. He didnt give Donald a whole bunch of rope.\n\nWhen Fred Trump visited one of his contractors, he sometimes brought Donald along and hired a teenage boy who lived next door to watch him during the meeting. One afternoon, recalled the sitter, Frank Briggs, 81, he led Trump on a sewer adventure during which it was pitch black and you couldnt see the entrance.\n\nThe thing that amazed me, Briggs said, was that Donny wasnt scared. He just kept walking.\n\nDennis Burnham was four years younger and lived around the corner from Donald. He inherited his own impression of his neighbor from his mother, who warned that he should stay away from the Trumps.\n\nDonald was known to be a bully, I was a little kid, and my parents didnt want me beaten up, said Burnham, 65, a business consultant in Texas.\n\nOnce when she left Dennis in a playpen in a back yard adjoining the Trumps property, Martha Burnham returned to find Donald throwing rocks at her son. She saw Donald standing at the fence, Dennis Burnham said, using the playpen for target practice.\n\nFor kindergarten, Donald went to the private Kew-Forest School, which required skirts for girls and ties and blazers for boys. Everyone had to rise when their teacher entered the classroom.\n\nDonald was among a group of boys who pulled girls hair, passed notes and talked out of turn. We threw spitballs and we played racing chairs with our desks, crashing them into other desks, recalled Paul Onish, a classmate, describing himself and Trump as probably the two worst.\n\nDonald spent enough time in detention, Onish said, that his buddies nicknamed the punishment DTs  short for Donny Trump.\n\nHe had a reputation for saying anything that came into his head, said Donald Kass, 70, a retired agronomist who was a schoolmate. When Trump misidentified Rocca, the pro wrestler, Kass recalled, We would laugh at him and tell him he was wrong, and hed say he was right. The next time, he would make the same mistake, and it would be the same thing all over again.\n\nIn his neighborhood, Donald and his friends were known to ride their bikes and shout and curse very loudly, said Steve Nachtigall, who lived nearby. Nachtigall said he once saw them jump off their bikes and beat up another boy.\n\nIts kind of like a little video snippet that remains in my brain because I think it was so unusual and terrifying at that age, recalled Nachtigall, 66, a doctor in New Jersey. He was a loudmouth bully.\n\nAfter he yanked her pigtails, Sharon Mazzarella hit Donald over the head with her metal lunch pail as she followed him down the stairs outside the school. I mustve been quite annoyed, Mazzarella said of the incident, which she described as her only memory of Trump.\n\nIn his memoir, The Art of the Deal, Trump wrote that his main focus as a youngster was creating mischief. As a second-grader, he wrote, he actually gave his music teacher a black eye because I didnt think he knew anything about music, and I almost got expelled.\n\nNone of Trumps childhood friends recall the incident or Donald talking about it then. Asked about the punch recently, Trump said, When I say punch, when youre that age, nobody punches very hard.\n\nAt a 2009 reunion, Kass said, the teacher, Charles Walker, told him that Trump had never struck him. But Walker, who died last year, claimed no affection for Trump. In the final stages of his life, according to his son, Charles Walker learned that Trump was considering a presidential bid.\n\nWhen that kid was 10, Peter Walker recalled his father telling family members gathered at his bedside, even then he was a little s---.\n\nIf his grades suffered and he annoyed his teachers, Trump found success on the playground. During dodgeball games, he was known for jumping and pulling his knees up to avoid balls thrown at him.\n\nThe Trumpet was always the last man standing, recalled Chrisman Scherf, 70, a classmate who is a surgeon in Arizona.\n\nTrumps best sport was baseball, a passion that inspired him, at 12, to write a prose poem that was published in the yearbook.\n\nI like to hear the crowd give cheers, so loud and noisy to my ears, Donald wrote. When the score is 5-5, I feel like I could cry. And when they get another run, I feel like I could die. Then the catcher makes an error, not a bit like Yogi Berra. The game is over and we say tomorrow is another day.\n\nBy sixth grade, Donalds power as a right-handed hitter was enough that fielders shifted to left field when he batted. If he had hit the ball to right, he couldve had a home run because no one was there, said Nicholas Kass, a schoolmate. But he always wanted to hit the ball through people. He wanted to overpower them.\n\nA catcher, Trumps uniform was often the dirtiest on the field, and he shrugged off foul balls clanging off his mask. After once making an out, Donald smashed neighbor Jeff Biers Adirondack bat on the pavement. The bat cracked, Bier said, but Trump did not apologize.\n\nIn those years, youngsters yearned for the new mitts with intricate webbing that Rawlings had begun manufacturing. Peter Brant persuaded his father to help pay for the $30 glove, but Donald could not persuade Fred Trump to buy him one.\n\nToo expensive, Fred told Donald, though he did agree to buy him a cheaper model.\n\nIn 1958, when they were 12, Trump and Brant liked to board an E train bound for Manhattan, a distant land of soaring, exotic promise. They did not ask their parents for permission for their Saturday expeditions. Manhattan was too far and too dangerous for two boys from the tranquil, low-slung reaches of Queens.\n\nExiting the train at 53rd Street and Fifth Avenue, Donald and Peter felt like an urban version of Lewis and Clark. They explored Central Parks bucolic recesses, watched African American men play basketball on courts along the East River and observed the panhandlers and hustlers in midtown.\n\nAround Times Square, they discovered novelty shops, where they bought stink bombs, hand buzzers and fake vomit  perfect accessories for pranking their pals. The shops also sold switchblades. On Broadway, West Side Story was a smash, and the boys, imagining themselves as gang members, bought knives to fit the part.\n\nNear the end of seventh grade, Fred discovered Donalds knives and was infuriated to learn about his trips into the city. He decided his sons behavior warranted a radical change. In the months before eighth grade, Fred Trump enrolled Donald at the New York Military Academy, a boarding school 70 miles from Jamaica Estates.\n\nDAntonio, the biographer who wrote Never Enough: Donald Trump and the Pursuit of Success, said Fred Trumps decision was a very severe response to a kid who hadnt gotten arrested and wasnt involved in drinking and drugging. He was essentially a smart aleck.\n\nThis was a profound rejection of Donald, he said.\n\nDonald did not announce his departure to his friends, who, when word filtered out, struggled to understand. It was a very, very sudden thing and I was really surprised and sad, Brant recalled. I always said to myself, Is there something I didnt know about his past that would make his father send him to the military academy?\n\nIrik Sevin, a prominent executive who was a year behind Trump at Kew-Forest, described Donald as a normal, rambunctious kid.\n\nThe rug was pulled out from under him, Sevin said.\n\nAt the military academy, Trump wore a crew cut, a thick wool uniform and was awoken daily by a recording of reveille.\n\nInstead of steaks prepared by his familys cook, Donald sat in a crowded mess hall and filled his plate from vats of meatloaf, spaghetti and something called mystery mountains, a stew of deep-fried leftovers remade as meatballs.\n\nInstead of his own bathroom, he had to shower with fellow cadets.\n\nInstead of his father, Donalds new taskmaster was Theodore Dobias, a no-nonsense combat veteran who had served in World War II and had seen Mussolinis dead body hanging from a rope.\n\nDobias, who died recently, would smack his cadets with an open hand if they ignored him, students recalled. He set up a boxing ring and forced students with poor grades and disciplinary problems to fight each other.\n\nAt the beginning, he didnt like the idea of being told what to do, like make your bed, shine your shoes, brush your teeth, clean the sink, do your homework, Dobias said in an interview last fall, referring to Trump. We really didnt care whether he came from Rockefeller Center or whatever. He was just another name.\n\nDobias said he recognized in Trump an innate drive: He wanted to be number one. He wanted to be noticed. He wanted to be recognized. And he liked compliments.\n\nTrump won medals for neatness and took pride in his grades. He distinguished himself on both the baseball and football teams.\n\nTo his classmates, Trump was a blend of friendly and cocky. He boasted that his fathers wealth doubled every time he completed a real estate deal. He was self-confident and very soft-spoken, believe it or not, as if he knew he was just passing time until he went on to something greater, said classmate Michael Pitkow.\n\nIn his room, Trump played Elvis Presley and Johnny Mathis albums. He liked to screw an ultraviolet light into the overhead socket and lie down for a tan. Were going to the beach, Trump would announce to his roommate, David Smith.\n\nBy senior year, Trump was known for bringing stylish women to campus and showing them around. They were beautiful, gorgeous women, dressed out of Saks Fifth Avenue, recalled classmate George White.\n\nLadies Man read the caption beneath a photo in the senior yearbook of Trump.\n\nAt times, Trump clashed with fellow cadets, including Ted Levine, with whom he shared a room at one point. Donald, Levine recalled, folded his towels and underwear so that every single one was perfectly squared. Like, insanely neat.\n\nAfter finding Levines unmade bed while on inspection duty, Trump tossed the sheets on the floor. Levine, who was a foot shorter than Trump, said he grabbed everything that was grabbable, hurling a combat boot at Donald and hitting him with a broomstick.\n\nEnraged, Trump shoved Levine toward a second-floor window. He tried to push me out, Levine said, but two cadets intervened.\n\nWithin the academys testosterone-driven culture, Levine said, Trumps aggression was understandable. Would I have respected him if he didnt? he asked. No. If he took that s--- from the little crap I was, he wouldnt be where he is today.\n\nIn his senior year, the academy appointed Trump to the prestigious position of captain of A Company. As a leader, recalled Peter Ticktin, a company platoon sergeant, Trump could inspire respect without raising his voice.\n\nHe never yelled at anyone, said Ticktin, now a Florida lawyer who touts Trumps candidacy on his Facebook page. Hed just look at you, the eyebrows kind of raised. The kind of look that said you cant disappoint him.\n\nA month after senior year started, Trump faced a crisis. One of his platoon sergeants shoved a plebe, Lee Ains, against a wall because the freshman was too slow snapping to attention. At the time, the academy was already dealing with a serious hazing incident and was sensitive to new allegations of abuse. The administration reassigned Trump as a battalion training officer.\n\nAins said the academy concluded that Trump had not monitored his officers as closely as he should have.\n\nTrump described his reassignment as a promotion. I did a good job and thats why I got elevated, he said.\n\nAfter his transfer, Trump led a drill team in New York Citys Columbus Day parade. Standing on Fifth Avenue, Trump turned to Maj. Anthony Ace Castellano and declared his ambition.\n\nYou know what, Ace? Castellano recalled Trump saying. Id really like to own some of this real estate some day.\n\nCollege awaited, but Trump seemed to know that he would follow his father into business, telling a roommate that he felt like he might be missing out if he did not. He considered attending film school in California but then decided New York would be his destination.\n\nIn 1964, after graduating from high school, Trump joined his father at the dedication of the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge. Amid the pageantry, Donald noticed that no one paid homage to the bridges 85-year-old Swedish designer, who had traveled from Europe for the occasion.\n\nI realized then and there that if you let people treat you how they want, youll be made a fool, he later told a reporter. I realized then and there something I would never forget: I dont want to be made anybodys sucker.\n\nBy his 18th year, Donald Trump had a clear sense of his own destiny, a vision he shared with a fellow cadet, Jeff Ortenau.\n\nIm going to be very famous one day, Donald promised.\n\nYou know what? Ortenau recalls telling Trump. Youre probably going to be president.','2017-03-25 03:51:13'),(369,48,'4b42a2376ef30904a8a7f25da5d3ea89b8b416a747ae1df946d1a0209d43d654','270aa05d95fd44a0ad1e0c2b409df875','','','> Drive was not something Elvis Presley was lacking. He envisioned exactly what he wanted at a very early age.\n\n> When I was a boy, I always saw myself as a hero in comic books and in movies, Presley said. I grew up believing this dream.\n\n> The future King of rock n roll was only 4-years-old when he told his parents he would eventually buy two Cadillacsone for him and one for them. It was not long after that statement, Elvis began his journey down the road toward successone that was filled with doubters, critics and roadblocks. If he had succumbed to any of the three, music and the world as we know it would not be the same. Elvis was born on January 8, 1935 in Tupelo, Mississippi to Vernon and Gladys Presley. His young life was not easy. The family was poor and forced to move often due to the financial strain. Elvis was called sweet and average by a teacher at East Tupelo Consolidated School and the future hip shakers shyness would contribute to his loner status and perceived awkwardness. And then came the Mississippi-Alabama Dairy Show A teacher encouraged the emerging artist to enter a singing contest at the fair. The 10-year-old earned 5th place. Thats right. Four other kids placed higher the first time Elvis competed with that iconic voice. However, that is also where Elvis started his music career. Soon after, his first guitar was purchased. Two years later, Elvis seized another opportunity. He was a huge fan of Mississippi Slims radio show and got to spend a lot of time at the Tupelo station. He was only 12-years-old when Slim gave him the chance to perform on-air. Stage fright got in the way. Shyness was his roadblock and it knocked the car off of the road at the first curve. However, Elvis got back in the drivers seat, faced his fears and did not falter when given a second chance. And then there was Memphis At the end of 1948, the Presley family moved to Memphis. Up until that point, Elvis had received mainly positive reinforcement when it came to his musical ability. However, the new city and school delivered the future Grammy winners first taste of criticismcriticism that would grow exponentially with his success. Elvis earned a C in music his 8th grade year. The teacher told the future King he had no aptitude for singing. Elvis did not back down and brought his guitar to school the next day to play and sing for her. Needless to say, it did not change the educators mind. Thankfully, the teenaged Elvis did not let one opinion halt his dream. Elvis continued to work hard and play music around Memphis. A few high school friends, who also had an aptitude and passion for music, joined him. The budding guitarist never learned to read music and played completely by ear. He was a music junkiespending hours in record store listening booths. His taste was diversecountry, gospel, blues and R&B. The future icon was starting to form a musical style that melded all of those genres together. However, the guy who was constantly working and practicing his craft actually failed music class in high school. And he kept on driving anyway. Elvis continued to live as a shy loner for most of his teenage years. The fashion-forward teen had already begun to develop a signature style. The trademark sideburns were grown and his clothes became more and more flashy. As a teenager, different does not translate well. Elvis was bullied and seen as awkward. Until Humess High School Annual Minstrel ShowIt was there his classmates discovered the shy senior sangand really well.\n\n> When I came onstage, I heard people kind of rumbling and whispering and so forth, cause nobody knew I even sang, he said. It was amazing how popular I became after that.\n\n> After graduation, Elvis drove in two directions. He took the realistic routedriving a truck by day and studying to become an electrician. He also took the dreamers pathauditioning and playing whenever and wherever he had the chance. And the roadblocks started popping up everywhere. Elvis auditioned for a local quartet and failed. They told Elvis Presley he couldnt sing. Shortly after that, he tried againthis time as a vocalist for a popular local band. After that audition, he was told to continue truck driving because youre never going to make it as a singer. While many people would take feedback like that as a reason to quit, Elvis just saw it as a detour sign. He kept working and trying other options. It was only months later that he got a call from the office of Sam Phillips. The record executive was already building a giant reputation in the music industry for the artists he was discovering and producing. Sun Records was a fledgling record label and Elvis needed a break. That first day of recording, produced nothing that Phillips thought would work. Elvis was molding himself into what he thought the producer wanted. Late that evening, the Elvis and the other musicians were having some fun during a break. They were singing a cover of Thats All Right in a very Presley way. It was exactly what Phillips wanted and Sam Phillips was rarely wrong when it came to music. Soon after, Memphis DJ Dewey Phillips played the recorded version of the song. The DJ received so many requests; he played Thats All Right continuously for the final two hours of his show. Elvis was something completely differentand the singer was acutely aware of that fact.\n\n> I happened to come along in the music business when there was no trend, Presley said. People were looking for something different and I was lucky. I came along just in time.\n\n> The record made an immediate impact in the South and it wasnt long until Elvis was invited to play the Grand Ole Oprya place he had always dreamed of performing. It was the first and only time. The singer was told he wasnt bad, but didnt suit the program. Even with success, came roadblocks. It only took two years for RCA to come calling. They bought Elvis contract from Phillips in 1956 and he immediately began recording his first album for them. The eventual phenomenons debut single, Heartbreak Hotel, went #1. It was around that time Elvis returned to the place where it all startedthe Mississippi-Alabama Fair and Dairy show. Only this time it would take nearly 100 National Guardsmen to control the screaming fans. The crowd reaction was something that would become a consistent problem throughout the singers career. And at the time, Elvis was worried.\n\n> Ill never make it, he said. It will never happen, because theyre never going to hear me cause theyre screaming all the time.\n\n> Elvis continued to pick up speed by starring in his first movie, Love Me Tender, and making numerous TV appearances. And the criticism began to gain momentum. After an appearance on the Milton Berle Show, Jack Gould, a New York Times critic, wrote, Mr. Presley has no discernible singing abilityHis phrasing, if it can be called that, consists of the stereotyped variations that go with a beginners aria in a bathtub.  His one specialty is an accented movement of the body  primarily identified with the repertoire of the blond bombshells of the burlesque runway. But Elvis didnt change a thing. The fan-base kept growing and the cheers kept getting louder. Ed Sullivan had declared Elvis unfit for family viewing. When the Milton Berle episode with Elvis beat Sullivan in ratings (for the first time ever), Sullivan had a change of heart. He booked Elvis for three episodes. The September 9, 1956 Ed Sullivan Show was seen by 60 million people82.6% of the television audience. Thats not a typo. The controversy and criticism continued. Religious leaders were protesting Elviss movement when he sang and the negative implications it could have on teenagers. This always baffled the star, because the movement had always been a natural extension of his music.\n\n> I enjoy what Im doing and I put my heart, soul and body into it. I guess one of the reasons people have liked it was because it was a little something different.\n\n> And music business people had no idea how to classify the star. He was topping almost every genres chart. There was no box that could hold himunless they created one. Roy Orbison explained it best.\n\n> His energy was incredible, his instinct was just amazing, Orbison said. I just didnt know what to make of it. There was just no reference point in the culture to compare it.\n\n> Elvis continued to gain fans in parts of the world where his music wasnt even officially releasedprior to the internet-era. When the singer was drafted and forced to halt his career for two years, he still managed to chart 10 Top 40 hits during that time. After he returned from serving, Elvis decided to conquer another craftacting. The entertainer spent a majority of the 60s becoming a movie starstarring in 33 feature films. He was criticized for his acting ability and the cheesy movies. However, his movies were commercially successful as were the soundtracks that accompanied them. When doubters said his music career was probably over because of the long acting break, Elvis got back onstage and proved them wrong again. Jon Landau of Eye magazine explained.\n\n> There is something magical about watching a man who has lost himself find his way back home, Landau said. He sang with the kind of power people no longer expect of rock n roll singers. He moved his body with a lack of pretension and effort that must have made Jim Morrison green with envy.\n\n> The legend never wavered in what he wanted and who he was. The awards are far too many to mention. Among them, was the Grammy Lifetime Achievement award he receivedat age 36. He is the best-selling solo artist in the history of popular music and Graceland is now the second most-visited home in the United Statesafter the White House. Elvis worked hard to drive a memorable race. He drove hard and fast through life, but down a meaningful and inspirational road. One of his greatest career achievements was fulfilling the promise he made as a four-year-old. He did indeed buy two Cadillacsand a few more. The entertainer loved music until the end and it was always so obvious. Even one of his most noted speeches quotes a song (Without a Song)\n\n> I learned very early in life that: Without a song, the day would never end; without a song, a man aint got a friend; without a song, the road would never bend  without a song. So I keep singing a song.\n\n> Although Elvis finished the race on August 16, 1977, both his memory and music will forever endure.\n\n> There are several unbelievable things about Elvis, but the most incredible is his staying power in a world where meteoric careers fade like shooting stars.

He looked down and noticed his hands were shaking and then he began perspiring profusely. The man next to him was not a member of the Memphis Mafia, a personal entourage that served as his supportive work staff and team of friends.\n\nIm scared to death, he expressed to the man, Frank C. Taylor, who reminded the performer that he had appeared hundreds of times to crowds much larger than the two thousand gathered.\n\nYeah, but not like this, Elvis reacted nervously.\n\nHe wasnt there to sing. After all, Elvis had just flown in from singing in Las Vegas the previous night just to settle into the top floor of the Rivermount Hotel so he could be nearby for this exceptional event. It was January 16, 1971 and Elvis was at the Memphis Municipal Auditorium to accept an award as one of The Ten Most Young Outstanding Men in the Nation. He had to give a speech.\n\nPast and future prominent recipients of this United States Junior Chamber of Commerce (Jaycees) award included Presidents John Kennedy, Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford, and Bill Clinton. Others notables were Howard Hughes, Orson Wells, Nelson Rockefeller, and Ted Kennedy.\n\n\"It was a different plateau for him, Taylor, the Chairman of the event for the Jaycees, told the Memphis Press-Scimitar later. For the first time, he was being paced on the level with achievers in realms other than entertainment, and for the first time Elvis felt he was being accepted like a true professional. He liked the association of being given such an honor along with those nine other guys, and he was impressed by their tremendous abilities. And none of the others singled Elvis out for adulation more than any other, and he liked that too.\"\n\nWhen Elvis\' turn came, he took his place at the podium and looked back at the other winners seated on stage. With a sweeping gesture, he said: \'These men may be the Kingdom of God.\'\"\n\nThe famous voice cracked, he could not go on.\n\n\"\'He was the only one to have genuine tears in his eyes and to break up,\' Taylor observed.\n\nElvis stopped, stepped back for a second, regrouped himself and spoke again.\n\nThen the famous singer began to speak, incorporating a favorite Roy Hamilton Rhythm and Blues tune, Without a Song.\n\nWhen I was a child, ladies and gentlemen, I was a dreamer. I read comic books, and I was the hero of the comic book. I saw movies, and I was the hero in the movie. So every dream I ever dreamed has come true a hundred times. These gentlemen over there, these are the type who care, are dedicated. You realize if it\'s not possible that they might be building the Kingdom, it\'s not far-fetched from reality. I learned very early in life that: Without a song, the day would never end; without a song, a man ain\'t got a friend; without a song, the road would never bend, without a song.\'\n\nElvis paused with tears in his eyes, saying humbly, So I keep singing my song. Goodnight. Thank you.\n\nThe superstar walked off the stage with the Jaycee Award, what he often referred to as his most valued achievement. The honor was so significant to him, that Elvis went to great lengths to make certain he could be there in person and labored weeks over his now famous speech. Elvis considered those words to be among his most valuable quotes.\n\nRon Ziegler, who was a fellow recipient that night in the National Affairs category, said Elvis was very pleased to receive the award, and it was an honor to him, and he so indicated, he was expressing a little discomfort of how he was going to react and to relate to the other people who were there. So we talked about that a little bit. It appeared to me at that time that he wanted to reach out and talk to someone different to that what he could find in his entourage. I didn\'t get the impression that he was limited or dull witted, I found him to be somewhat articulate and poised individual, I did sense however an individual who was withdrawn and an individual who was somewhat shy.\n\nElvis was not comfortable giving speeches. Although his most famous words are Thank ya. Thank ya very much, its a difficult task choose his finest quotes. When selecting the five best for AXS Entertainment, it became clear that some of his utmost profound and eloquent messages came from Elviss humblest quotations. Although almost 40 years have passed since his death on August 16, 1977, Elvis still remains in the hearts and minds of millions of fans worldwide.\n\nThe following quotes, deemed among the five best of Elvis Presley, offer valuable insight into the beliefs of the greatest entertainer in history.\n\nPeople ask me where I got my singing style. I didn\'t copy my style from anybody.\n\nOne of the biggest mistakes people have made since the beginning of his career was to label, pigeonhole, or even try to brand Elvis. He was too big for anything the world had ever dealt with to be able to do that.\n\nAlthough deemed the King of Rock n Roll, the fact is Elviss contributions go far beyond that genre and even further than just music. He not only pioneered, engineered and premiered in Country, R&B, Gospel, Blues, and Rock, Elvis evolved, revolved, and was involved in fashion, movies, entertainment, merchandising (Teddy bears and guitars, for instance), and even travel (Hawaii tourism exploded because of some of his films).\n\nWhen I was a boy, I always saw myself as a hero in comic books and in movies. I grew up believing this dream.\n\nElvis, with his bejeweled and flashy white jumpsuits, literally became the star from his beloved comic books. He collected law enforcement agency badges (even from President Richard Nixon), wore police uniforms, carried a gun, learned karate and even had a police force flashlight with him the night of the Jaycee awards. Within months of becoming a singing sensation, at age 21, he was whisked away to Hollywood to become a box office idol in 33 movies.\n\nWhen things go wrong, don\'t go with them.\n\nElvis continually faced rejection, obstacles and criticisms throughout his life. As a young boy his father was sent to prison. Soon his mother and he lost their home. In the 8th grade, his music teacher graded Elvis a C in her class. He was turned down after auditioning for an amateur gospel quartet called the Songfellows in 1954. The next year, he was given a thumbs down for TVs talent show, Arthur Godfreys Talent Scouts. Critics, reviewers, evangelists, politicians and entertainers slammed him. Even Ed Sullivan, Frank Sinatra and other show business greats initially cut him down.\n\nWhat did he do? He didnt follow the advice of the naysayers and anchor draggers. Elvis forged on by blazing new trails and actually changed the world. Later, he adopted a Taking Care of Business (TCB) lightening symbol to go along with his comic book hero dreams of getting things done in a flash.\n\nTruth is like the sun. You can shut it out for a time, but it ain\'t going away.\n\nA universal law, full of certainty, reality and actuality, is rolled up into this simple quote. Despite the trials of his extraordinary life of 42 years, Elvis bled the music in the words to many of his songs. Examples? His truth is marching on from American Trilogy, and I did it my way from Paul Ankas tune of the same name.\n\nSad thing is, you can still love someone and be wrong for them.\n\nThis 13-word quote is about a profound as any of the words from some of his most tear-jerking love songs. Heartbreak Hotel, I Was the One, It Hurts Me, Im so Lonesome I Could Cry, and Separate Ways are just five that come to mind.','2017-03-25 03:51:13'),(371,49,'4ce175becd4bae60ac03e02a55fdf30b0df6b902880371ebf93809f3fabb5aaf','b87e15e082f3454a8e98033c83756770','','','\"It\'s whatever the audience wants it to be\".','2017-03-25 03:51:13'),(372,49,'4ce175becd4bae60ac03e02a55fdf30b0df6b902880371ebf93809f3fabb5aaf','397294e330c644d8b0deb5af3c55e654','','','Pulp Fiction turns 20 this year, and after we got over feeling really old, we pulled together some facts about the Quentin Tarantino masterpiece you (probably) didn\'t know.

Everyone who considers himself in the know about the drug subculture has heard that 420 has something to do with illegal drug use, but when you press them, they never seem to know why, or even what the term supposedly signifies.\n\nIts both more and less than people make it out to be. The term 420 began its sub-rosa linguistic career in 1971 as a bit of slang casually used by a group of high school kids (known as Waldos) at San Rafael High School in California. The term 420 (always pronounced four-twenty, never four hundred and twenty) came to be an accepted part of the argot within that group of about a dozen pot smokers, beginning as a reminder of the time they planned to meet to light up,\n\n[The 420] origins appear to lie in the escapades of a group of friends from San Rafael high school, northern California, in 1971. That autumn, the five teenagers came into possession of a hand-drawn map supposedly locating a marijuana crop at Point Reyes, north-west of San Francisco. The friends  who called themselves the Waldos because they used to hang out by a wall  met after school, at 4:20 pm, and drove off on their treasure hunt. They never found the plot. We were smoking a lot of weed at the time, says Dave Reddix or Waldo Dave, now a filmmaker. Half the fun was just going looking for it. The group began using the term 420. So did friends and acquaintances, who included  at a couple of steps removed  members of the Grateful Dead rock band. The term spread among the bands fans, known as Deadheads. Then in 1990 Steve Bloom, an editor at High Times, saw 420 explained on a Grateful Dead concert flyer. Staff on the magazine, long the leading publication on marijuana, started using it.\n\n\n\nKeep in mind this wasnt a general call to all dope smokers everywhere to toke up at twenty past four every day; it was twelve kids whod made a date to meet after school near a certain statue. Its thus incorrect to deem that 420 originated as the designation of a national or international dope-smoking time, even though the term began as a reference to a particular time of day, as the originators of that term explained:\n\nThe Waldos met at 4:20 for exactly all of the reasons we have discussed in the past: The time we got out of school was approximately 3 p.m., but some of us had after school sports activities that lasted until after There was just enough time to get back to the statue of Louis Pasteur to smoke and look for the pot fields drawn in a treasure map.\n\n\n\nThese days 420 is used as a generic way of declaring one likes to use marijuana or just as a term for the substance itself. Its earliest connotation of having to do with the time a certain group of students congregated to smoke wacky tobaccy is unknown to many of those who now employ the term. Indeed, most instead believe one or more of the many spurious explanations that have since grown up about this much abused short form:\n\n\n\n420 is the penal code section for marijuana use in California. Nope. Section 420 of the California penal code refers to obstructing entry on public land. The penal codes of other states list different entries for 420, but none of them matches anything having to do with marijuana. However, on 1 January 2004 the Governor of California signed that states which regulates marijuana used for medical purposes. This bill comes years after the term 420 was associated with marijuana and indeed its number likely was chosen because of the existing pop culture connection. This is the tail wagging the dog, not the other way around. Its the Los Angeles or New York police radio code for marijuana smoking in progress. Its not the police radio code for anything, let alone that. Its the number of chemical compounds in marijuana. The number of chemical compounds in marijuana is 315, according to the folks at magazine. April 20 is the date that Jim Morrison, Jimi Hendrix, or Janis Joplin died. Though these performers were strongly identified with drug use during their brief lifetimes and the emerging drug culture after their demises, none of them kicked the bucket on Morrison died on Hendrix on and Joplin on The 20th of April is the best time to plant marijuana. Theres no one best time  that answer would change from one part of the country to another, or even one country to another. Albert Hofmann took the first deliberate LSD trip at 4:20 on 1943. This was indeed the case  his lab notes back this up. But this wasnt the source of 420, just an oddball coincidence. (For the pedants out there, Hofmanns first LSD trip, which was accidental, took place on 1943.) Its the code you send to your drug dealers pager. Yeah, right. All drug dealers recognize a 420 page as Please be waiting on the corner with my baggie of wildwood weed. When the Grateful Dead toured, they always stayed in\n\nSpurious etymologies and uncertain definition aside, 420 has slipped into a position of semi-respectability within the English lexicon. Various free-wheeling cities annually celebrate hemp fests onTheres a 4:20 record label in California, and a band called 4:20. Atlantas Sweetwatersells itsAle in supermarkets and opens its doors to the public atMondays through Thursdays. New Yorkssells low-cost travel packages to the Netherlands and Jamaica. Highway 420 Radio broadcasts music for the chemically enhanced. And in 2001, the forReal.org web site of theof Health and Human Services Center for Substance Abuse Prevention put out a public service document titled, ItsYou Know Where Your Teen Is?\n\n420s are routinely slipped into popular movies and television shows. In Fast Times at Ridgemont High the score of the football game was Most of the clocks in Pulp Fiction are set to 4:20 (but not all: when the kid receives the watch its set at 9:00). And there are many other instances, so keep your eyes peeled.\n\nHowever, as amusing as it is to tie 420 to pot smoking and hunt for it in popular movies, the number has its dark side. Hitler was born on 1889, and the massacre of at Columbine High School in Colorado took place on 1999.','2017-03-25 03:51:13'),(378,49,'4ce175becd4bae60ac03e02a55fdf30b0df6b902880371ebf93809f3fabb5aaf','025b168038944071be54a6c8e909230b','','','Here is the latest in a series of examinations into urban legends about movies and whether they are true or false.

I will try to give you the basic outline. Im also assuming that the readers are familiar with the events surrounding the September 30th coup attempt.\n\nSukarno in 1965 was a very popular president with the population and had a lot of loyalists among the member of the armed forces. The process by which he lost his was power was initiated by army officers under Suharto. It was done in a very slow and deliberate fashion because of Sukarnos popularity. Political scientist Harold Crouch calls it a creeping coup.\n\nThe process began early on October 1st when Suharto refused to let General Pranoto Reksosamudro go to Halim air force base to fulfill Sukarnos summon. Sukarno has appointed Pranoto as army chief caretaker after he learned of Ahmad Yanis demise.\n\nThe next day, in a meeting with Sukarno, Suharto refused to accept Pranotos appointment. Suharto finally agreed to Pranotos appointment as daily caretaker of the army on the condition that he himself was given authority to restore security and order.\n\nIn the following days, Sukarno tried to control the situation by appealing for calm and restraint. However, the army leadership deliberately began to create a highly emotional atmosphere in which the dominant them was the call for revenge.\n\nOn October 2nd, army Brigadier General Sutjipto of the Supreme Operation Command (KOTI) held a meeting with anti-communist leaders, which immediately thereafter formed the Action Front to Crush the Thirtieth of September Movement (KAP-Gestapu). Led by young leaders from Muslim and Catholic organizations and political parties, this action front first held an anti PKI rally on October 4th. Another bigger rally was held on October 8th and ended with rally goers attacking and burning down PKI headquarters.\n\nOn October 6th the armed forcess newspaper, Angkatan Bersenjata, accused PKI as the mastermind behind the coup attempt in an editorial. Rumors also began to circulate that the army officers were tortured and their genitals mutilated by PKIs women organization, the Gerwani.\n\nOn October 18th army controlled radios announced the banning of PKI and its front organizations. The announcement served as a pretext for the army to launch a campaign of mass arrests and killings against suspected (and accused) leftists, which also included Sukarno loyalists. They did this mainly with the help of Muslim organizations. The killings arrests effectively eliminated one of Sukarnos biggest power bases and intimidated other Sukarnos loyalists in the population and armed forces.\n\nSukarno ordered the violence to be stopped to no avail and he also rejected demands from the army to blame and ban PKI for the coup attempt.\n\nBeginning in January 1966, student demonstrations came up with three demands; disband PKI, bring down prices of everyday goods, and reshuffle the presidents cabinet.\n\nOn February 21st Sukarno announced a new cabinet, which was rejected by the student demonstrators as containing PKI sympathizers. Student demonstrations intensified and on February 24th the students blocked the streets leading to the presidential palace in an effort to boycott the inauguration of the new cabinet. During the demonstration a student was shot dead by the presidential guard, further inflaming the situation.\n\nOn March 11th, during a full cabinet meeting in the presidential palace, Sukarno was informed that there were unidentified army units surrounding the palace. Sukarno decided to leave the palace on a helicopter to Bogor palace just outside Jakarta.\n\nLater in the afternoon of the same day, three army generals who were pro-Suharto came to Bogor palace to meet Sukarno; Maj. Gen. Basuki Rahmat, Minister for Veteran Affairs, Brig. Gen. M. Jusuf, Minister for Basic Industry and Brig. Gen. Amirmachmud, Commander of the V/Jaya Jakarta Military Area Command.\n\nThey came back with a presidential order (known in Indonesian as the Supersemar) signed by Sukarno. The presidential order assigned Suharto to \"take all measures considered necessary to guarantee security, calm and stability of the government and the revolution and to guarantee the personal safety and authority [of Sukarno]\".\n\nThere are still controversies regarding Sukarnos motivation and the circumstances in which he produced the order. However, it effectively transferred power to Suharto.\n\nOn March 12th, Suharto, using the presidential order, officially banned the PKI.\n\nOn March 18th, Subandrio and 14 other ministers were arrested, including third deputy prime minister Chairul Saleh. This further eroded Sukarnos power.\n\nOn March 27th, a new cabinet line-up greed between Suharto and Sukarno was announced. It included Suharto himself as interim deputy prime minister for security and defense affairs, tasked with preventing the resurgence of communism.\n\nUsing the Presidential Order of the 11th of March along with his new position as deputy prime minister, Suharto and his allies continued to purge state institution from Sukarno loyalists. The Tjakrabirawa palace guard was disbanded and parliament members loyal who were pro communists and Sukarno loyalists were replaced with those who where pro-Suharto.\n\nThe Indonesian parliament began its session on June 20th headed by anti communist army general Nasution, one of the most senior army generals. Nasution survived the kidnapping attempt on September 30th, but he lost a young daughter. Shock from this loss was apparently one of the main reasons why he let the much younger and more junior Suharto play a more leading role in the push against PKI and Sukarno.\n\nThe session produced several decrees, one of which was the ratification of the Supersemar (the 11th of March Presidential Order), thus making revocation of it almost impossible. It also ratified the banning of the PKI and the teaching of Marxist ideology, instructed Suharto to form a new cabinet, called on Sukarno to provide an explanation for the economic and political situation in the nation and stripped him of the title \"president for life\". It also passed a decree stating that if the president was unable to carry out his duties, the holder of the Supersemar would assume the presidency.\n\nThe parliament also began to the proceedings to impeach Sukarno on the base that he failed to condemn the 30th September movement and supported PKIs international communism agenda in violation of the constitution. Sukarno was also accused of neglecting the economy and promoting moral degradation through his womanizing.\n\nOn June 22nd 1966 Sukarno delivered a speech in front of the parliament in an ultimately unsuccessful attempt to defend his presidency. Impeachment process continued.\n\nOn March 12th 1967 the parliament stripped Sukarno of his president for life title and he was put under de facto house arrest in Bogor palace. Suharto was appointed as acting president.\n\nOn March 27th 1968, another session of the parliament appointed Suharto as the second president of Indonesia.','2017-03-25 03:51:13'),(407,54,'5b09d5700fa64044a482f960514d358402a3c4b9b68f7cb9ad5e18a8b4283e74','12ff6430101c4ecea405406ef0266b04','','','Space stamp, from the ugliest series of stamps I\'ve seen Czechoslovakia','2017-03-25 03:51:13'),(408,54,'5b09d5700fa64044a482f960514d358402a3c4b9b68f7cb9ad5e18a8b4283e74','f6b66694624640b4bc48e29303d6a0dd','','','A fraudster who claimed to be the adopted son of a former Indonesian president was today jailed for defrauding elderly Canterbury and North Otago investors of $1.6 million.\n\nIn a surprise turnaround, nine weeks into his trial, James Lindon Graham, 68, admitted his guilt on 99 charges of fraud when he appearedin the Timaru District Court before Judge Brian Callaghan.

He entered office with overwhelming popular support and was widely regarded as a national hero. He brought with him a reputation for loving his country, and for loving women. Sukarno couldnt have anticipated it at the time, but his habits eventually attracted the interest of some of the most powerful intelligence agencies in the world. Indonesia would play an important role in the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union. The Pacific archipelago nation was populous, strategically vital and home to the largest communist party outside of the Soviet Union. Sukarnowhile not a communist himself had communist allies and shared some of the ideologys tendencies, which did not endear him to Western leaders. For these reasons, and undoubtedly others, Moscow and Washington played tug-of-war with Indonesia for decades. In their more desperate but imaginative moments, spies for both governments tried to turn Sukarnos famed sexual prowess against him. These efforts included a CIA-produced pornographic film and a honey pot scheme with KGB operatives dressed as flight attendants. Indonesia became a valuable prize soon after independence. U.S. foreign policy elites were also strong believers in the domino theory, which posited that communist revolutions, if allowed to occur, would spread to neighboring countries. Sukarnos sympathy toward communismand budding ties with the Soviet Union and Chinaeventually convinced the U.S. government to engineer his ouster. By 1962, British Prime Minister Macmillan and President [John F.] Kennedy agreed to liquidate President Sukarno, depending on the situation and available opportunities, a 1962 CIA memorandum noted, according to Paul Lashmar and James Oliver writing in The Independent.\n\nBut the CIA employed multiple methods in its efforts to oust the Indonesian president, and far earlier. The agency wasted a million dollars trying to sway the Indonesian elections of 1955, according to Evan Thomas The Very Best Men: The Daring Early Years of the CIA. To the agencys chagrin, the communist partyan important Sukarno allyreceived a surprising six million votes in the election. Over the next two years, Sukarno strengthened ties with Moscow and Beijing. The CIA considered a full-scale paramilitary operation but put that plan on ice after Frank Wisner, the longtime Directorate of Plans for the CIA, advised that such an operation could fail or backfire, according to Thomas. Absolute control [of the rebellion] could not be guaranteed that explosive results were always possible, that U.S. officials must be braced for allegations of covert U.S. activities, Wisner warned. With the CIAs hopes of friendly rebels overthrowing Sukarno curtailed, the agency searched for alternative methods. When reports surfaced that Sukarno engaged in an affair with a flight attendantwho may have been a KGB spythe spooks saw an opportunity to exploit his alleged promiscuity while undercutting his status as a national hero. Buy The Very Best Men: The Daring Early Years of the CIA Initially, the CIA relied on spreading rumors and pushing reports of the alleged affair. The idea was that Sukarnos well-known womanizing had trapped him in the spell of a Soviet female agent, William Blum wrote in Killing Hope: U.S. Military and CIA Interventions Since World War II. He had succumbed to Soviet control, CIA reports implied, as a result of her influence or blackmail, or both. The reports of Sukarno gallivanting with a Russian flight attendant, and potentially providing the Soviets with some leverage against him, seems to have had some basis in reality. Sukarno had traveled in the company of a blonde flight attendant during a visit to the Soviet Union, and the same flight attendant later traveled to Indonesia with Soviet official Kliment Voroshilov and was seen in Sukarnos company several times, according to Blum. And the Soviets did at one point attempt to blackmail Sukarno by filming him having sex with a group of flight attendants. When Sukarno visited Moscow in the 1960s, the KGB sought to take advantage of his renowned sexual appetite, sending a batch of glamorous young women posing as air hostesses to his hotel, Tim Lister wrote in a CNN piece on sex and espionage. Listers timeline might be off, as other sources suggest that the KGB was cooking up stories about Sukarno and flight attendants as far back as 1957 or 1958. Regardless of the timing, the KGB misread a crucial aspect of Sukarnos sexual proclivitieshe never tried to hide those tendencies. If anything, he flaunted them. Sukarno openly supported polygamy, Elizabeth Martyn explained in The Womens Movement in Postcolonial Indonesia. He took on four official wives while maintaining a de facto marriage with a fifth wife. And Sukarno once bragged to a U.S. diplomat that he was a very physical man who needed sex every day, and shocked his government hosts in Washington when he demanded they provide him with call girls during a visit, according to Peter Arnetts Live From the Battlefield. Given Sukarnos boasts, the KGB shouldnt have been too surprised that its efforts to blackmail him went astray. When the Russians later confronted him with a film of the lurid encounter, Sukarno was apparently delighted, Lister wrote. Legend has it he even asked for extra copies. The CIA was equally slow in learning this lesson. Propaganda agents continued spreading the rumor of the Soviets blackmailing Sukarno with a sex tape. Meanwhile, the agency pushed forward with the paramilitary operation, despite Wisners warnings.\n\nThe agency armed and trained tens of thousands of rebels and soldiers of fortune from The Philippines, Taiwan and the United States at bases in Okinawa, The Philippines and Singapore, according to Blum. U.S. Navy submarines landed over-the-beach parties on Indonesian shores, and Air Force planes dropped weapons into rebel strongholds deep inside Indonesia. The operation borrowed a fleet of sanitized non-attributable B-26s for air support. Rebellion broke out in early 1958, and the CIA continued to provide weapons, supplies and logistical support, in addition to conducting bombing raids and strafing government forces. Despite this, the rebels still proved ineffective. When CIA pilot Allen Lawrence Pope was shot down and captured with documents that implicated the CIA and the U.S. government, the agency withdrew its support for military operations and the rebellion fizzled. Frustrated and desperate, agents revisited the idea of turning Sukarnos sexual appetites against him.\n\nWe had as a matter of fact, considerable success with this theme, Joseph Burkholder Smith, who led CIA operations in Indonesia from 19561958, wrote in his memoirs. [Sukarnos alleged dalliances with flight attendants] appeared in the press around the world, and when Round Table, the serious British quarterly of international affairs, came to analyze the Indonesian revolt in its March 1958 issue, it listed Sukarnos being blackmailed by a Soviet female spy as one of the reasons that caused the uprising. The general line of thinking at the CIA seemed to be that if the sexy spy story had inspired the rebellion to some extent, then the spies just needed a bigger, sexier story to kick off a successful revolution. And what better way to tell a story than with visual aids? So they, too, decided to make their own sex tape, starring Sukarno. Sort of. A substantial effort was made to come up with a pornographic film or at least some still photographs that could pass for Sukarno and his Russian girlfriend engaged in his favorite activity, Blum wrote. When scrutiny of available porno films (supplied by the Chief of Police of Los Angeles) failed to turn up a couple who could pass for Sukarno (dark and bald) and a beautiful blonde Russian woman, the CIA undertook to produce its own films. Buy Killing Hope: U.S. Military and C.I.A. Interventions Since World War II This suggests the CIA had somehow heard about the Soviet films, but not that they were a complete bust. Nonetheless, as agents failed to find lookalikes in available films, they also failed to find an actor who could stand in for Sukarno. So the CIA decided to make a full-face mask of the Indonesian leader, Blum wrote. The mask would then be sent to Los Angeles where the police were to pay some porno-film actor to wear it during his big scene. Presumably, there were no close ups. However, by all accounts, a film was produced. Its just the details that are still a matter of debate. In The CIAs Black Ops: Covert Action, Foreign Policy, and Democracy, John Jacob Nutter contends that the film, titled Happy Days, was produced with the actor wearing a mask. Blum, on the other hand, agreed on the title but alleged that the film was made by Robert Maheu, former FBI agent and intimate of Howard Hughes, at a later date using a Sukarno lookalike. Regardless of who starred in it or whether or not they wore a mask, theres no evidence that the video was ever distributed, perhaps because the CIA came face-to-face with the realities of adult film distribution in the days before the Internet or even VHS. Reel-to-reel film simply did not make sense as an effective tool for delivering propaganda to the masses. And ultimately, it didnt matter. The CIA, with some help from its British allies at MI6, eventually facilitated a coup that led to Sukarnos government being replaced by the pro-Western dictatorship of Suharto in 1967. Suhartos New Order then embarked on a campaign of mass murder targeting (real or suspected) communists. The overthrow of Sukarno was one of the most successful coups MI6 was involved with, a former agent who worked on propaganda operations in Indonesia told Lashmar and Oliver for The Independent. And it was, apparently, helped along by smut.','2017-03-25 03:51:13'),(410,54,'5b09d5700fa64044a482f960514d358402a3c4b9b68f7cb9ad5e18a8b4283e74','90bdc1475ce741d08998b741dd5b3055','','','The nation was shocked and shaken out of its trance by an abortive coup on September 30, 1965. A clique of military conspirators calling itself the September 30th Movement kidnapped and killed six top army generals, seized a few key urban points, and proclaimed a new revolutionary regime. General Suharto, the commander of the Jakarta garrison, swiftly reversed the coup. Suharto and the military generally believed the Indonesian Communist Party (Partai Komunis Indonesia; PKI)which to some measure had been supported and protected by Sukarnoto be behind the attempted coup. The PKI, by contrast, understood the plot to be entirely a military matter. There ensued an oblique contest for power between Suharto and Sukarno, during which thousands of communists and alleged communists were slaughtered by the military; estimates of the number of people killed during the purge range from 80,000 to more than 1,000,000. As the country recoiled in horror, activist youths demanded the political demise of Sukarno, the Sukarnoists, and Sukarnoism and the total reform and reorganization of the state. On March 11, 1966, Sukarno was obliged to delegate wide powers to Suharto, who subsequently became acting president (March 1967) and then president (March 1968), as Sukarno sank into disgrace and dotage. Sukarno died at the age of 69 of a chronic kidney ailment and numerous complications. Suharto decreed a quick and quiet funeral. Nevertheless, at least 500,000 persons, including virtually all of Jakartas important personages, turned out to pay their last ambivalent respects. The next day another 200,000 assembled in Blitar, near Surabaya, for the official service followed by burial in a simple grave alongside that of his mother. The cult and ideology of Sukarnoism were proscribed until the late 1970s, when the government undertook a rehabilitation of Sukarnos name.

He was a prominent leader of Indonesia\'s nationalist movement during the Dutch colonial period, and spent over a decade under Dutch detention until released by the invading Japanese forces. Sukarno and his fellow nationalists collaborated to garner support for the Japanese war effort from the population, in exchange for Japanese aid in spreading nationalist ideas. Upon Japanese surrender, Sukarno and Mohammad Hatta declared Indonesian independence on 17 August 1945, and Sukarno was appointed as first president. He led Indonesians in resisting Dutch re-colonization efforts via diplomatic and military means until the Dutch acknowledgment of Indonesian independence in 1949. Author Pramoedya Ananta Toer once wrote \"Sukarno was the only Asian leader of the modern era able to unify people of such differing ethnic, cultural and religious backgrounds without shedding a drop of blood.\"[3]\n\nAfter a chaotic period of parliamentary democracy, Sukarno established an autocratic system called \"Guided Democracy\" in 1957 that successfully ended the instability and rebellions which were threatening the survival of the diverse and fractious country. The early 1960s saw Sukarno veering Indonesia to the left by providing support and protection to the Indonesian Communist Party (PKI) at the expense of the military and Islamists. He also embarked on a series of aggressive foreign policies under the rubric of anti-imperialism, with aid from the Soviet Union and China. The 30 September Movement (1965) led to the destruction of the PKI and his replacement in 1967 by one of his generals, Suharto (see Transition to the New Order), and he remained under house arrest until his death.\n\nThe spelling Soekarno, based on Dutch orthography, is still frequently used, mainly because he signed his name in the old spelling. Sukarno himself insisted on a \"u\", not \"oe\", but said that he had been told in school to use the Dutch style. He said that it was too difficult to change his signature, so still wrote it with an \"oe\".[4] Official Indonesian presidential decrees from the period 19471968, however, printed his name using the 1947 spelling. The SoekarnoHatta International Airport which serves near Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia, still uses the Dutch spelling.\n\nIndonesians also remember him as Bung Karno (Brother/Comrade Karno) or Pak Karno (\"Mr. Karno\").[5] Like many Javanese people, he had only one name.[6] According to author Pramoedya Ananta Toer in several interviews, \"bung\" is an affectionate title meaning \"friend\" creatively used to be an alternative way of addressing person in equal manner, as an opposite word of old-form \"tuan\", \"mas\" or \"bang\".\n\nHe is sometimes referred to in foreign accounts as \"Achmad Sukarno\", or some variation thereof. The (entirely fictitious) first name was reputedly added by a British journalist, who felt his readers would be confused over someone with just a single name.[citation needed]\n\nThe son of a Javanese primary school teacher, an aristocrat named Raden Soekemi Sosrodihardjo, and his Balinese wife from the Brahman caste named Ida Ayu Nyoman Rai from Buleleng regency, Sukarno was born at Jalan Pandean IV/40 Soerabaia (now known as Surabaya), East Java, in the Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia). He was originally named Kusno[7] [ksn]. Following Javanese custom, he was renamed after surviving a childhood illness. After graduating from a native primary school in 1912, he was sent to the Europeesche Lagere School (a Dutch primary school) in Mojokerto. Subsequently, in 1916, Sukarno went to a Hogere Burgerschool (a Dutch type higher level secondary school) in Surabaya, where he met Tjokroaminoto, a nationalist and founder of Sarekat Islam. In 1920, Sukarno married Tjokroaminoto\'s daughter Siti Oetari. In 1921, he began to study civil engineering (with focusing on architecture) at the Technische Hoogeschool te Bandoeng (Bandoeng Institute of Technology), where he obtained an Ingenieur degree (abbreviated as \"Ir.\", a Dutch type engineer\'s degree) in 1926. During his study in Bandung, Sukarno became romantically involved with Inggit Garnasih, the wife of Sanoesi, the owner of the boarding house where he lived as a student. Inggit was 13 years older than Sukarno. In March 1923, Sukarno divorced Siti Oetari to marry Inggit (who also divorced her husband Sanoesi). Sukarno later divorced Inggit and married Fatmawati.\n\nAfter graduation in 1926, Sukarno and his university friend Anwari established the architectural firm Sukarno & Anwari in Bandung, which provided planning and contractor services. Among Sukarno\'s architectural works are the renovated building of the Preanger Hotel (1929), where he acted as assistant to famous Dutch architect Charles Prosper Wolff Schoemaker. Sukarno also designed many private houses on today\'s Jalan Gatot Subroto, Jalan Palasari, and Jalan Dewi Sartika in Bandung. Later on, as president, Sukarno remained engaged in architecture, designing the Proclamation Monument and adjacent Gedung Pola in Jakarta; the Youth Monument (Tugu Muda) in Semarang; the Alun-alun Monument in Malang; the Heroes\' Monument in Surabaya; and also the new city of Palangkaraya in Central Kalimantan.\n\nAtypically, even among the country\'s small educated elite, Sukarno was fluent in several languages. In addition to the Javanese language of his childhood, he was a master of Sundanese, Balinese and of Indonesian, and was especially strong in Dutch. He was also quite comfortable in German, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese, all of which were taught at his HBS. He was helped by his photographic memory and precocious mind.[8]\n\nIn his studies, Sukarno was \"intensely modern,\" both in architecture and in politics. He despised both the traditional Javanese feudalism, which he considered \"backward\" and to blame for the fall of the country under Dutch occupation and exploitation, and the imperialism practiced by Western countries, which he termed as \"exploitation of humans by other humans\" (exploitation de l\'homme par l\'homme). He he blamed this for the deep poverty and low levels of education of Indonesian people under the Dutch. To promote nationalistic pride amongst Indonesians, Sukarno interpreted these ideas in his dress, in his urban planning for the capital (eventually Jakarta), and in his socialist politics, though he did not extend his taste for modern art to pop music; he had Koes Bersaudara imprisoned for their allegedly decadent lyrics despite his own reputation for womanising. For Sukarno, modernity was blind to race, neat and elegant in style, and anti-imperialist.[9]\n\nSukarno was first exposed to nationalist ideas while living under Tjokroaminoto. Later, while a student in Bandung, he immersed himself in European, American, Nationalist, communist, and religious political philosophy, eventually developing his own political ideology of Indonesian-style socialist self-sufficiency. He began styling his ideas as Marhaenism, named after Marhaen, an Indonesian peasant he met in southern Bandung area, who owned his little plot of land and worked on it himself, producing sufficient income to support his family. In university, Sukarno began organising a study club for Indonesian students, the Algemeene Studieclub, in opposition to the established student clubs dominated by Dutch students.\n\nOn 4 July 1927, Sukarno with his friends from the Algemeene Studieclub established a pro-independence party, Partai Nasional Indonesia (PNI), of which Sukarno was elected the first leader. The party advocated independence for Indonesia, and opposed imperialism and capitalism because it opined that both systems worsened the life of Indonesian people. The party also advocated secularism and unity amongst the many different ethnicities in the Dutch East Indies, to establish a united Indonesia. Sukarno also hoped that Japan would commence a war against the western powers and that Java could then gain its independence with Japan\'s aid. Coming soon after the disintegration of Sarekat Islam in the early 1920s and the crushing of Partai Komunis Indonesia after their failed rebellion of 1926, PNI began to attract a large number of followers, particularly among the new university-educated youths eager for larger freedoms and opportunities denied to them in the racist and constrictive political system of Dutch colonialism.[10]\n\nPNI activities came to the attention of the colonial government, and Sukarno\'s speeches and meetings were often infiltrated and disrupted by agents of the colonial secret police (Politieke Inlichtingen Dienst/PID). Eventually, Sukarno and other key PNI leaders were arrested on 29 December 1929 by Dutch colonial authorities in a series of raids throughout Java. Sukarno himself was arrested while on a visit to Yogyakarta. During his trial at the Bandung Landraad courthouse from August to December 1930, Sukarno made a series of long political speeches attacking colonialism and imperialism, titled Indonesia Menggoegat (Indonesia Accuses).\n\nIn December 1930, Sukarno was sentenced to four years in prison, which were served in Sukamiskin prison in Bandung. His speech, however, received wide coverage by the press, and due to strong pressure from the liberal elements in both Netherlands and Dutch East Indies, Sukarno was released early on 31 December 1931. By this time, he had become a popular hero widely known throughout Indonesia.\n\nHowever, during his imprisonment, PNI had been splintered by oppression of colonial authorities and internal dissension. The original PNI was disbanded by the Dutch, and its former members formed two different parties; the Partai Indonesia (Partindo) under Sukarno\'s associate Sartono who were promoting mass agitation, and the Pendidikan Nasional Indonesia (PNI Baroe) under Mohammad Hatta and Soetan Sjahrir, two nationalists who recently returned from studies in the Netherlands, and who were promoting a long-term strategy of providing modern education to the uneducated Indonesian populace to develop an intellectual elite able to offer effective resistance to Dutch rule. After attempting to reconcile the two parties to establish one united nationalist front, Sukarno chose to become the head of Partindo on 28 July 1932. Partindo had maintained its alignment with Sukarno\'s own strategy of immediate mass agitation, and Sukarno disagreed with Hatta\'s long-term cadre-based struggle. Hatta himself believed Indonesian independence would not occur within his lifetime, while Sukarno believed Hatta\'s strategy ignored of the fact that politics can only make real changes through formation and utilisation of force (machtsvorming en machtsaanwending).[10]\n\nDuring this period, to support himself and the party financially, Sukarno returned to architecture, opening the bureau of Soekarno & Rooseno. He also wrote articles for the party\'s newspaper, Fikiran Ra\'jat. While based in Bandung, Sukarno travelled extensively throughout Java to establish contacts with other nationalists. His activities attracted further attention by the Dutch PID. In mid-1933, Sukarno published a series of writings titled Mentjapai Indonesia Merdeka (\"To Attain Independent Indonesia\"). For this writing, he was arrested by Dutch police while visiting fellow nationalist Mohammad Hoesni Thamrin in Jakarta on 1 August 1933.\n\nThis time, to prevent providing Sukarno with a platform to make political speeches, the hardline governor-general Jonkheer Bonifacius Cornelis de Jonge utilised his emergency powers to send Sukarno to internal exile without trial. In 1934, Sukarno was shipped, along with his family (including Inggit Garnasih), to the remote town of Ende, on the island of Flores. During his time in Flores, he utilised his limited freedom of movement to establish a children\'s theatre. Among its members was future politician Frans Seda. Due to an outbreak of malaria in Flores, the Dutch authorities decided to move Sukarno and his family to Bencoolen (now Bengkulu) on western coast of Sumatra, in February 1938.\n\nIn Bengkulu, Sukarno became acquainted with Hassan Din, the local head of Muhammadiyah organisation, and he was allowed to teach religious teachings at a local school owned by the Muhammadiyah. One of his students was 15-year-old Fatmawati, daughter of Hassan Din. He became romantically involved with Fatmawati, which he justified by stating the inability of Inggit Garnasih to produce children during their almost 20-year marriage. Sukarno was still in Bengkulu exile when the Japanese invaded the archipelago in 1942.\n\nIn early 1929, during the Indonesian National Revival, Sukarno and fellow Indonesian nationalist leader Mohammad Hatta (later Vice President), first foresaw a Pacific War and the opportunity that a Japanese advance on Indonesia might present for the Indonesian independence cause.[11] In February 1942 Imperial Japan invaded the Dutch East Indies quickly defeating Dutch forces who marched, bussed and trucked Sukarno and his entourage three hundred kilometres from Bengkulu to Padang, Sumatra. They intended keeping him prisoner and shipping him to Australia, but abruptly abandoned him to save themselves upon the impending approach of Japanese forces on Padang.[12]\n\nThe Japanese had their own files on Sukarno and the Japanese commander in Sumatra approached him with respect, wanting to use him to organise and pacify the Indonesians. Sukarno on the other hand wanted to use the Japanese to gain independence for Indonesia: \"The Lord be praised, God showed me the way; in that valley of the Ngarai I said: Yes, Independent Indonesia can only be achieved with Dai Nippon...For the first time in all my life, I saw myself in the mirror of Asia.\"[13] In July 1942, Sukarno was sent back to Jakarta, where he re-united with other nationalist leaders recently released by the Japanese, including Mohammad Hatta. There, he met the Japanese commander General Hitoshi Imamura, who asked Sukarno and other nationalists to galvanise support from Indonesian populace to aid Japanese war effort.\n\nSukarno was willing to support the Japanese, in exchange for a platform for himself to spread nationalist ideas to the mass population. The Japanese, on the other hand, needed Indonesia\'s manpower and natural resources to help its war effort. The Japanese recruited millions of people, particularly from Java, to be forced labor called \"romusha\" in Japanese. They were forced to build railways, airfields, and other facilities for the Japanese within Indonesia and as far away as Burma. Additionally, the Japanese requistioned rice and other food produced by Indonesian peasants to supply their own troops, while forcing the peasantry to cultivate castor oil plants to be used as aviation fuel and lubricants.[14]\n\nTo gain cooperation from Indonesian population and to prevent resistance to these measures, the Japanese put Sukarno as head of Tiga-A mass organisation movement. In March 1943, the Japanese formed a new organisation called Poesat Tenaga Rakjat (POETERA/ Center of People\'s Power) under Sukarno, Hatta, Ki Hadjar Dewantara, and KH Mas Mansjoer. The aim of these organisations were to galvanise popular support for recruitment of romusha forced labor, requisitioning of food products, and to promote pro-Japanese and anti-Western sentiments amongst Indonesians. Sukarno coined the term, Amerika kita setrika, Inggris kita linggis (\"Let\'s iron America, and bludgeon the British\") to promote anti-Allied sentiments. In later years, Sukarno was lastingly ashamed of his role with the romusha. Additionally, food requisitioning by the Japanese caused widespread famine in Java which killed more than one million people in 19441945. In his view, these were necessary sacrifices to be made to allow for future independence of Indonesia.[15] He also was involved with the formation of Pembela Tanah Air (PETA) and Heiho (Indonesian volunteer army troops) via speeches broadcast on the Japanese radio and loud speaker networks across Java and Sumatra. By mid-1945 these units numbered around two million, and were preparing to defeat any Allied forces sent to re-take Java.\n\nIn the meantime, Sukarno eventually divorced Inggit, who refused to accept her husband\'s wish for polygamy. She was provided with a house in Bandung and a pension for the rest of her life. In 1943, he married Fatmawati. They lived in a house in Jalan Pegangsaan Timur No. 56, confiscated from its previous Dutch owners and presented to Sukarno by the Japanese. This house would later be the venue of the Proclamation of Indonesian Independence in 1945.\n\nOn 10 November 1943 Sukarno and Hatta were sent on a seventeen-day tour of Japan, where they were decorated by the Emperor Hirohito and wined and dined in the house of Prime Minister Hideki Tojo in Tokyo. On 7 September 1944, with the war going badly for the Japanese, Prime Minister Kuniaki Koiso promised independence for Indonesia, although no date was set.[16] This announcement was seen, according to the U.S. official history, as immense vindication for Sukarno\'s apparent collaboration with the Japanese.[17] The U.S. at the time considered Sukarno one of the \"foremost collaborationist leaders.\"[18]\n\nOn 29 April 1945, with the fall of Philippines to American hands, the Japanese allowed for the establishment of Badan Penjelidik Oesaha-oesaha Persiapan Kemerdekaan Indonesia (BPUPKI), a quasi-legislature consisting of 67 representatives from most ethnic groups in Indonesia. Sukarno was appointed as head of BPUPKI and was tasked to lead discussion to prepare the basis of a future Indonesian state. To provide a common and acceptable platform to unite the various squabbling factions in BPUPKI, Sukarno formulated his ideological thinking developed for the past twenty years into five principles. On 1 June 1945, he introduced these five principles, known as pancasila, during the joint session of BPUPKI held in the former Volksraad Building (now called Gedung Pancasila).\n\nPancasila as presented by Sukarno during the BPUPKI speech, consisted of five common principles which Sukarno saw as commonly shared by all Indonesians:\n\nOn 22 June, the Islamic and nationalist elements of BPUPKI created a small committee of nine, which formulated Sukarno\'s ideas into the five-point Pancasila, in a document known as the Jakarta Charter:\n\nDue to pressure from the Islamic element, the first principle mentioned the obligation for Muslims to practice Islamic law (sharia). However, the final Sila as contained in the 1945 Constitution which was put into effect on 18 August 1945, excluded the reference to Islamic law for sake of national unity. The elimination of sharia was done by Mohammad Hatta based upon request by Christian representative Alexander Andries Maramis, and after consultation with moderate Islamic representatives Teuku Mohammad Hassan, Kasman Singodimedjo, and Ki Bagoes Hadikoesoemo.[19]\n\nOn 7 August 1945, the Japanese allowed the formation of a smaller Panitia Penjelidik Kemerdekaan Indonesia (PPKI), a 21-person committee tasked with creating specific governmental structure of future Indonesian state. On 9 August, the top leaders of PPKI (Sukarno, Hatta, and KRT Radjiman Wediodiningrat), were summoned by Commander-in-Chief of Japan\'s Southern Expeditionary Forces, Field Marshal Hisaichi Terauchi, to Da Lat, 100km from Saigon. Field Marshal Terauchi gave Sukarno the freedom to proceed with preparation for Indonesian independence, free of Japanese interference. After much wining and dining, Sukarno\'s entourage was flown back to Jakarta on 14 August. Unbeknownst to the guests, atomic bombs had been dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and the Japanese were preparing for surrender.\n\nThe following day, on 15 August, the Japanese declared their acceptance of the Potsdam Declaration terms, and unconditionally surrendered to the Allies. On the afternoon of that day, Sukarno received this information from leaders of youth groups and members of PETA Chairul Saleh, Soekarni, and Wikana, who had been listening to Western radio broadcasts. They urged Sukarno to declare Indonesian independence immediately, while the Japanese were in confusion and before the arrival of Allied forces. Faced with this quick turn of events, Sukarno procrastinated. He feared bloodbath due to hostile response from the Japanese to such a move, and was concerned with prospects of future Allied retribution.\n\nAt early morning on 16 August, the three youth leaders, impatient with Sukarno\'s indecision, kidnapped him from his house and brought him to a small house in Rengasdengklok, Karawang, owned by a Chinese family and occupied by PETA. There they gained Sukarno\'s commitment to declare independence the next day. That night, the youths drove Sukarno back to the house of Admiral Tadashi Maeda, the Japanese naval liaison officer in the Menteng area of Jakarta, who sympathised with Indonesian independence. There, he and his assistant Sajoeti Melik prepared the text of the Proclamation of Indonesian Independence.\n\nIn the early morning of 17 August 1945, Sukarno returned to his house at Jl Pegangsaan Timur No. 56, where he was joined by Mohammad Hatta. Throughout the morning, impromptu leaflets printed by PETA and youth elements informed the population of the impending proclamation. Finally, at 10am, Sukarno and Hatta stepped to the front porch, where Sukarno declared the independence of the Republic of Indonesia in front of a crowd of 500 people. This most historic of buildings had, however, been ordered to be demolished by Sukarno himself, without any apparent reason.[20]\n\nOn the following day, 18 August, PPKI declared the basic governmental structure of the new Republic of Indonesia:\n\nSukarno\'s vision for the 1945 Indonesian constitution comprised the Pancasila (five principles). Sukarno\'s political philosophy was mainly a fusion of elements of Marxism, nationalism and Islam. This is reflected in a proposition of his version of Pancasila he proposed to the BPUPKI (Inspectorate of Indonesian Independence Preparation Efforts) in a speech on 1 June 1945.[19]\n\nSukarno argued that all of the principles of the nation could be summarized in the phrase gotong royong.[21] The Indonesian parliament, founded on the basis of this original (and subsequently revised) constitution, proved all but ungovernable. This was due to irreconcilable differences between various social, political, religious and ethnic factions.[22]\n\nIn the days following the Proclamation, the news of Indonesian independence was spread by radio, newspaper, leaflets, and word of mouth despite attempts by the Japanese soldiers to suppress the news. On 19 September, Sukarno addressed a crowd of one million people at the Ikada Field of Jakarta (now part of Merdeka Square) to commemorate one month of independence, indicating the strong level of popular support for the new republic, at least on Java and Sumatra. In these two islands, the Sukarno government quickly established governmental control while the remaining Japanese mostly retreated to their barracks awaiting arrival of Allied forces. This period was marked by constant attacks by armed groups on Europeans, Chinese, Christians, native aristocracy and anyone who were perceived to oppose Indonesian independence. The most serious cases were the Social Revolutions in Aceh and North Sumatra, where large numbers of Acehnese and Malay aristocrats were killed by Islamic groups (in Aceh) and communist-led mobs (in North Sumatra), and the \"Three Regions Affair\" in northwestern coast of Central Java where large numbers of Europeans, Chinese, and native aristocrats were butchered by mobs. These bloody incidences continued until late 1945 to early 1946, and begin to peter-out as Republican authorities begin to exert and consolidate control.\n\nSukarno\'s government initially postponed the formation of a national army, for fear of antagonizing the Allied occupation forces and their doubt over whether they would have been able to form an adequate military apparatus to maintain control of seized territory. The members of various militia groups formed during Japanese occupation such as the disbanded PETA and Heiho, at that time were encouraged to join the BKRBadan Keamanan Rakjat (The People\'s Security Organization)itself a subordinate of the \"War Victims Assistance Organization\". It was only in October 1945 that the BKR was reformed into the TKRTentara Keamanan Rakjat (The People\'s Security Army) in response to the increasing Allied and Dutch presence in Indonesia. The TKR armed themselves mostly by attacking Japanese troops and confiscating their weapons.\n\nDue to sudden transfer of Java and Sumatra from General Douglas MacArthur\'s American-dominated Southwest Pacific Area to Lord Louis Mountbatten\'s British-dominated Southeast Asian Command, the first Allied soldiers (1st Battalion of Seaforth Highlanders) only arrived in Jakarta in late September 1945. British forces began to occupy major Indonesian cities in October 1945. The commander of British 23rd Division, Lieutenant General Sir Philip Christison, set up command in the former governor-general\'s palace in Jakarta. Christison stated its intentions as the liberation of all Allied prisoners-of-war, and to allow the return of Indonesia to its pre-war status, as colony of Netherlands. The Republican government were willing to cooperate with regards to the release and repatriation of Allied civilian and military POWs, setting-up the Committee for the Repatriation of Japanese and Allied Prisoners of Wars and Internees (Panitia Oeroesan Pengangkoetan Djepang dan APWI/POPDA) for this purpose. POPDA, in cooperation with the British, repatriated more than 70,000 Japanese and Allied POWs and internees by the end of 1946. To resist Dutch attempts to regain control of the country, Sukarno\'s strategy was to seek international recognition and support for the new Indonesian Republic, in view of the relative military weakness of the Republic compared with British and Dutch military power.\n\nSukarno was aware that his history as a Japanese collaborator and his leadership in the Japanese-approved PUTERA during the Occupation may complicate relationship with the Western countries. Hence, to help acquire international recognition as well as to accommodate domestic demands for establishment of political parties, Sukarno allowed the formation of parliamentary system of government, whereby a prime minister controlled day-to-day affairs of the government, while Sukarno as president remained as figurehead. The prime minister and his cabinet will be responsible to the Central Indonesian National Committee instead of the president. On 14 November 1945, Sukarno appointed Sutan Sjahrir as first prime minister; he was a European-educated politician who was never involved with the Japanese occupation authorities.\n\nOminously, Dutch soldiers and administrators under the name of Netherlands Indies Civil Administration (NICA) began to return under the protection of the British. They were led by Hubertus Johannes van Mook, a pre-war Dutch colonial administrator who led the Dutch East Indies government-in-exile in Brisbane, Australia. They armed released Dutch POWs, which began to engage in shooting rampages against Indonesian civilians and Republican police. As a consequence, armed conflict soon erupted between the newly constituted Republican forces aided by a myriad of pro-independence mob groups, against the British and Dutch forces. On 10 November, a full-scale battle broke out in Surabaya between the British Indian 49th Infantry Brigade and the indigenous Indonesian population, involving air and naval bombardments of the city by the British. 300 British soldiers were killed (including their commander Brigadier Aubertin Walter Sothern Mallaby), while thousands of Indonesians died. Shootouts broke out with alarming regularity in Jakarta, including an attempted assassination of Prime Minister Sjahrir by Dutch gunmen. To avoid this menace, Sukarno and majority of his government left for the safety of Yogyakarta on 4 January 1946. There, the Republican government received protection and full support from Sultan Hamengkubuwono IX. Yogyakarta would remain as the Republic\'s capital until the end of the war in 1949. Sjahrir remained in Jakarta to conduct negotiations with the British.[23]\n\nThe initial series of battles in late 1945 and early 1946 left the British in control of major port cities on Java and Sumatra. During the Japanese occupation, the Outer Islands (excluding Java and Sumatra) was occupied by Japanese Navy (Kaigun), which did not allow for political mobilisation in their areas on account of the small population base available for mobilisation, and the proximity of these areas to active theatres of war. Consequently, there were little Republican activity in these islands post-proclamation. Australian and Dutch forces quickly occupied these islands without much fighting by end of 1945 (excluding the resistance of I Gusti Ngurah Rai in Bali, the insurgency in South Sulawesi, and fighting in Hulu Sungai area of South Kalimantan). Meanwhile, the hinterland areas of Java and Sumatra remained under Republican administration.\n\nEager to pull out its soldiers from Indonesia, the British allowed for large-scale infusion of Dutch forces into the country throughout 1946. By November 1946, all British soldiers have been withdrawn from Indonesia, replaced by more than 150,000 Dutch soldiers. On the other hand, the British sent Lord Archibald Clark Kerr, 1st Baron Inverchapel and Miles Lampson, 1st Baron Killearn to bring the Dutch and Indonesians to the negotiating table. The result of these negotiations was the Linggadjati Agreement signed in November 1946, where the Dutch acknowledged de facto Republican sovereignty over Java, Sumatra, and Madura. In exchange, the Republicans were willing to discuss future Commonwealth-like United Kingdom of Netherlands and Indonesia.\n\nSukarno\'s decision to negotiate with the Dutch was met with strong opposition by various Indonesian factions. Tan Malaka, a communist politician, organised these groups into a united front called the Persatoean Perdjoangan (PP). PP offered a \"Minimum Program\" which called for complete independence, nationalisation of all foreign properties, and rejection of all negotiations until all foreign troops are withdrawn. These programmes received widespread popular support, including from armed forces commander General Sudirman. On 4 July 1946, military units linked with PP kidnapped Prime Minister Sjahrir who was visiting Yogyakarta. Sjahrir was leading the negotiation with the Dutch. Sukarno, after successfully influencing Sudirman, managed to secure the release of Sjahrir and the arrest of Tan Malaka and other PP leaders. Disapproval of Linggadjati terms within the KNIP led Sukarno to issue a decree doubling KNIP membership by including many pro-agreement appointed members. As consequence, KNIP ratified the Linggadjati Agreement in March 1947.[24]\n\nOn 21 July 1947, the Linggadjati Agreement was broken by the Dutch, who launched Operatie Product, a massive military invasion into Republican-held territories. Although the newly reconstituted TNI was unable to offer significant military resistance, the blatant violation by the Dutch of an internationally brokered agreement outraged world opinion. International pressure forced the Dutch to halt their invasion force in August 1947. Sjahrir, who has been replaced as prime minister by Amir Sjarifuddin, flew to New York City to appeal Indonesian case in front of United Nations. UN Security Council issued a resolution calling for immediate ceasefire, and appointed a Good Offices Committee (GOC) to oversee the ceasefire. The GOC, based in Jakarta, consisted of delegations from Australia (led by Richard Kirby, chosen by Indonesia), Belgium (led by Paul van Zeeland, chosen by Netherlands), and United States (led by Frank Porter Graham, neutral).\n\nThe Republic was now under strong Dutch military stranglehold, with the Dutch military occupying West Java, and the northern coast of Central Java and East Java, along with the key productive areas of Sumatra. Additionally, the Dutch navy blockaded Republican areas from supplies of vital food, medicine, and weapons. As a consequence, Prime Minister Amir Sjarifuddin has little choice but to sign the Renville Agreement on 17 January 1948, which acknowledged Dutch control over areas taken during Operatie Product, while the Republicans pledged to withdraw all forces that remained on the other side of the ceasefire line (\"Van Mook Line\"). Meanwhile, the Dutch begin to organize puppet states in the areas under their occupation, to counter Republican influence utilising ethnic diversity of Indonesia.\n\nThe signing of highly disadvantageous Renville Agreement caused even greater instability within the Republican political structure. In Dutch-occupied West Java, Darul Islam guerrillas under Sekarmadji Maridjan Kartosuwirjo maintained their anti-Dutch resistance and repealed any loyalty to the Republic; they caused a bloody insurgency in West Java and other areas in the first decades of independence. Prime Minister Sjarifuddin, who signed the agreement, was forced to resign in January 1948, and was replaced by Mohammad Hatta. Hatta cabinet\'s policy of rationalising the armed forces by demobilising large numbers of armed groups that proliferated the Republican areas, also caused severe disaffection. Leftist political elements, led by resurgent Indonesian Communist Party (PKI) under Musso took advantage of public disaffections by launching rebellion in Madiun, East Java, on 18 September 1948. Bloody fighting continued during late-September until end of October 1948, when the last communist bands were defeated and Musso shot dead. The communists had overestimated their potential to oppose the strong appeal of Sukarno amongst the population.\n\nOn 19 December 1948, to take advantage of the Republic\'s weak position following the communist rebellion, the Dutch launched Operatie Kraai, a second military invasion designed to crush the Republic once and for all. The invasion was initiated with an airborne assault on Republican capital Yogyakarta. Sukarno ordered the armed forces under Sudirman to launch guerilla campaign in the countryside, while he and other key leaders such as Hatta and Sjahrir allowed themselves to be taken prisoner by the Dutch. To ensure continuity of government, Sukarno sent a telegram to Sjafruddin Prawiranegara, providing him the mandate to lead an Emergency Government of the Republic of Indonesia (PDRI), based on the unoccupied hinterlands of West Sumatra, a position he kept until Sukarno was released in June 1949. The Dutch sent Sukarno and other captured Republican leaders to captivity in Prapat, in Dutch-occupied part of North Sumatra and later to the island of Bangka.\n\nThe second Dutch invasion caused even more international outrage. The United States, impressed by Indonesia\'s ability to defeat the 1948 communist challenge without outside help, threatened to cut off Marshall Aid funds to the Netherlands if military operations in Indonesia continued. TNI did not disintegrate and continued to wage guerilla resistance against the Dutch, most notably the assault on Dutch-held Yogyakarta led by Lieutenant-Colonel Suharto on 1 March 1949. Consequently, the Dutch were forced to sign the Roem-van Roijen Agreement on 7 May 1949. According to this treaty, the Dutch released the Republican leadership and returned the area surrounding Yogyakarta to Republican control in June 1949. This was followed by the Dutch-Indonesian Round Table Conference held in The Hague which led to the complete transfer of sovereignty by the Queen Juliana of the Netherlands to Indonesia, on 27 December 1949. On that day, Sukarno flew from Yogyakarta to Jakarta, making a triumphant speech at the steps of the governor-general\'s palace, immediately renamed the Merdeka Palace (\"Independence Palace\").\n\nAt this time, as part of a compromise with the Dutch, Indonesia adopted a new federal constitution that made the country a federal state called the Republik Indonesia Serikat (Republic of United States of Indonesia), consisting of the Republic of Indonesia whose borders were determined by the \"Van Mook Line\", along with the six states and nine autonomous territories created by the Dutch. During the first half of 1950, these states gradually dissolved themselves as the Dutch military that previously propped them up was withdrawn. In August 1950, with the last state  the State of East Indonesia  dissolving itself, Sukarno declared a Unitary Republic of Indonesia based on the newly formulated provisional constitution of 1950. Both the Federal Constitution of 1949 and the Provisional Constitution of 1950 were parliamentary in nature, where executive authority laid with the prime minister, and whichon paperlimited presidential power. However, even with his formally reduced role, he commanded a good deal of moral authority as Father of the Nation.\n\nThe first years of parliamentary democracy proved to be very unstable for Indonesia. Cabinets fell in rapid succession due to the acute differences between the various political parties within the newly appointed parliament (Dewan Perwakilan Rakjat/DPR). There was severe disagreements on future path of Indonesian state, between nationalists who wanted a secular state (led by Partai Nasional Indonesia first established by Sukarno), the Islamists who wanted an Islamic state (led by Masyumi Party), and the communists who wanted a communist state (led by PKI, only allowed to operate again in 1951). On the economic front, there was severe dissatisfaction with continuing economic domination by large Dutch corporations and the ethnic-Chinese.\n\nThe Darul Islam rebels under Kartosuwirjo in West Java refused to acknowledge Sukarno\'s authority and declared a NII (Negara Islam Indonesia  Islamic State of Indonesia) in August 1949. Rebellions in support of Darul Islam also broke out in South Sulawesi in 1951, and in Aceh in 1953. Meanwhile, pro-federalism members of the disbanded KNIL launched failed rebellion in Bandung (APRA rebellion of 1950), in Makassar in 1950, and in Ambon (Republic of South Maluku revolt of 1950).[25]\n\nAdditionally, the military was torn by hostilities between officers originating from the colonial-era KNIL, who wished for a small and elite professional military, and the overwhelming majority of soldiers who started their careers in the Japanese-formed PETA, who were afraid of being discharged and were more known for nationalist-zeal over professionalism.\n\nOn 17 October 1952, the leaders of the former-KNIL faction, Army Chief Colonel Abdul Haris Nasution and Armed Forces Chief-of-Staff Tahi Bonar Simatupang mobilized their troops in a show of force. Protesting against attempts by the DPR to interfere in military business on behalf of the former-PETA faction of the military, Nasution and Simatupang had their troops surround the Merdeka Palace and point their tank turrets at the building. Their demand to Sukarno was that the current DPR be dismissed. For this cause, Nasution and Simatupang also mobilized civilian protesters. Sukarno came out of the palace and convinced both the soldiers and the civilians to go home. Nasution and Simatupang were later dismissed. Nasution, however, would be re-appointed as Army Chief after reconciling with Sukarno in 1955.\n\nIn 1954, Sukarno married Hartini, a 30-year-old widow from Salatiga, whom he met during a reception. His third wife, Fatmawati was outraged by this fourth marriage. She left Sukarno and their children, although they never officially divorced. Fatmawati no longer took up the duties as First Lady, a role subsequently filled by Hartini.\n\nThe 1955 elections produced a new Parliament and a Constitutional Assembly. The election results showed equal support for the antagonistic powers of the PNI, Masyumi, Nahdlatul Ulama, and PKI parties. With no faction controlling a clear majority, domestic political instability continued unabated. Talks in the Constitutional Assembly to write a new constitution met with deadlock over the issue of whether to include Islamic law.\n\nOn the international front, Sukarno organized the Bandung Conference in 1955, with the goal of uniting the developing Asian and African countries into a \"non-aligned movement\" to counter both the United States and the Soviet Union.[26]\n\nSukarno came to resent his figurehead position and the increasing disorder of the country\'s political life. Claiming that Western-style parliamentary democracy was unsuitable for Indonesia, he called for a system of \"guided democracy.\" Sukarno argued that at the village level, important questions were decided by lengthy deliberation designed to achieve a consensus, under the guidance of village elders. Sukarno argued it should be the model for the entire nation, with the president taking the role assumed by village elders. He proposed a government based not only on political parties but on \"functional groups\" composed of the nation\'s basic elements, which would together form a National Council, through which a national consensus could express itself under presidential guidance.\n\nVice-President Mohammad Hatta was strongly opposed to Sukarno\'s guided democracy concept. Citing this and other irreconcilable differences, Hatta resigned from his position in December 1956. Hatta\'s retirement sent a shockwave across Indonesia, particularly among the non-Javanese ethnicities, who viewed Hatta as their representative in a Javanese-dominated government.\n\nFrom December 1956 to January 1957, regional military commanders in North Sumatra, Central Sumatra, and South Sumatra provinces took over local government control. They declared a series of military councils which were to run their respective areas and refused to accept orders from Jakarta. A similar regional military movement took control of North Sulawesi in March 1957. They demanded the elimination of communist influence in government, equal share in government revenues, and reinstatement of the former Sukarno-Hatta duumvirate.\n\nFaced with this serious challenge to the unity of the republic, Sukarno declared martial law (Staat van Oorlog en Beleg) on 14 March 1957. He appointed a non-partisan prime minister Djuanda Kartawidjaja, while the military was in the hands of his loyal General Nasution. Nasution increasingly shared Sukarno\'s views on the negative impact of western democracy on Indonesia, and he saw a greater role for the military in political life.\n\nAs a reconciliatory move, Sukarno invited the leaders of the regional councils to Jakarta on 1014 September 1957, to attend a National Conference (Musjawarah Nasional), which failed to bring a solution to the crisis. On 30 November 1957, an assassination attempt was made on Sukarno by way of a grenade attack while he was visiting a school function in Cikini, Central Jakarta. Six children were killed, but Sukarno did not suffer any serious wounds. The perpetrators were members of the Darul Islam group, under the order of its leader Sekarmadji Maridjan Kartosuwirjo.\n\nBy December 1957, Sukarno began to take serious steps to enforce his authority over the country. On that month, he nationalized 246 Dutch companies which had been dominating the Indonesian economy, most notably the NHM, Royal Dutch Shell subsidiary Bataafsche Petroleum Maatschappij, Escomptobank, and the \"big five\" Dutch trading corporations (NV Borneo Sumatra Maatschappij / Borsumij, NV Internationale Crediet- en Handelsvereeneging \"Rotterdam\" / Internatio, NV Jacobson van den Berg & Co, NV Lindeteves-Stokvis, and NV Geo Wehry & Co), and expelled 40,000 Dutch citizens remaining in Indonesia while confiscating their properties, purportedly due to the failure by the Dutch government to continue negotiations on the fate of Netherlands New Guinea as was promised in the 1949 Round Table Conference.[27] Sukarno\'s policy of economic nationalism was strengthened by the issuance Presidential Directive No. 10 of 1959, which banned commercial activities by foreign nationals in rural areas. This rule targeted ethnic Chinese, who dominated both the rural and urban retail economy despite the fact that at this time few of them had Indonesian citizenship. This policy resulted in massive relocation of the rural ethnic-Chinese population to urban areas, and approximately 100,000 chose to return to China.\n\nTo face the dissident regional commanders, Sukarno and Army Chief Nasution decided to take drastic steps following the failure of Musjawarah Nasional. By utilizing regional officers that remained loyal to Jakarta, Nasution organized a series of \"regional coups\" which ousted the dissident commanders in North Sumatra (Colonel Maludin Simbolon) and South Sumatra (Colonel Barlian) by December 1957. This returned government control over key cities of Medan and Palembang.\n\nIn February 1958, the remaining dissident commanders in Central Sumatra (Colonel Ahmad Hussein) and North Sulawesi (Colonel Ventje Sumual) declared the PRRI-Permesta Movement aimed at overthrowing the Jakarta government. They were joined by many civilian politicians from the Masyumi Party, such as Sjafruddin Prawiranegara who were opposed to growing influence of communists. Due to their anti-communist rhetoric, the rebels received money, weapons, and manpower from the CIA in a campaign known as Archipelago. This support ended when Allen Lawrence Pope, an American pilot, was shot down after a bombing raid on government-held Ambon in April 1958. In April 1958, the central government responded by launching airborne and seaborne military invasions on Padang and Manado, the rebel capitals. By the end of 1958, the rebels had been militarily defeated, and the last remaining rebel guerilla bands surrendered in August 1961.[28] [29]\n\nThe impressive military victories over the PRRI-Permesta rebels and the popular nationalisation of Dutch companies left Sukarno in a very strong position. On 5 July 1959, Sukarno reinstated the 1945 constitution by presidential decree. It established a presidential system which he believed would make it easier to implement the principles of guided democracy. He called the system Manifesto Politik or Manipolbut was actually government by decree. Sukarno envisioned an Indonesian-style socialist society, adherent to the principle of USDEK:\n\nIn March 1960, Sukarno disbanded parliament and replaced it with a new parliament where half the members were appointed by the president (Dewan Perwakilan Rakjat  Gotong Rojong / DPR-GR). In September 1960, he established a Provisional People\'s Consultative Assembly (Madjelis Permusjawaratan Rakjat Sementara/MPRS) as the highest legislative authority according to the 1945 constitution. MPRS members consisted of members of DPR-GR and members of \"functional groups\" appointed by the president.\n\nWith the backing of the military, Sukarno disbanded the Islamic party Masyumi and Sutan Sjahrir\'s party PSI, accusing them of involvement with PRRI-Permesta affair. The military arrested and imprisoned many of Sukarno\'s political opponents, from socialist Sjahrir to Islamic politicians Mohammad Natsir and Hamka. Using martial law powers, the government closed-down newspapers who were critical of Sukarno\'s policies.No reference\n\nDuring this period, there were several assassination attempts on Sukarno\'s life. On 9 March 1960, Daniel Maukar, an Indonesian airforce lieutenant who sympathised with the Permesta rebellion, strafed the Merdeka Palace and Bogor Palace with his MiG-17 fighter jet, attempting to kill the president; he was not injured. In May 1962, Darul Islam agents shot at the president during Eid al-Adha prayers on the grounds of the palace. Sukarno again escaped injury.\n\nOn the security front, the military started a series of effective campaigns which ended the long-festering Darul Islam rebellion in West Java (1962), Aceh (1962), and South Sulawesi (1965). Kartosuwirjo, the leader of Darul Islam, was captured and executed in September 1962.\n\nTo counterbalance the power of the military, Sukarno started to rely on the support of the Communist Party of Indonesia (PKI). In 1960, he declared his government to be based on Nasakom, a union of the three ideological strands present in Indonesian society: nasionalisme (nationalism), agama (religions), and komunisme (communism). Accordingly, Sukarno started admitting more communists into his government, while developing strong relationship with the PKI chairman Dipa Nusantara Aidit.\n\nIn order to increase Indonesia\'s prestige, Sukarno supported and won the bid for the 1962 Asian Games held in Jakarta. Many sporting facilities such as the Senayan sports complex (including the 100,000-seat Bung Karno Stadium) were built to accommodate the games. There was political tension when the Indonesians refused the entry of delegations from Israel and Taiwan. After the International Olympic Committee put sanctions on Indonesia due to this exclusion policy, Sukarno retaliated by organising a \"non-imperialist\" competitor event to the Olympic Games, called the Games of New Emerging Forces (GANEFO). GANEFO was successfully held in Jakarta in November 1963, and was attended by 2,700 athletes from 51 countries.\n\nAs part of his prestige-building program, Sukarno ordered the construction of large monumental buildings such as National Monument (Monumen Nasional), Istiqlal Mosque, Jakarta, CONEFO Building (now the Parliament Building), Hotel Indonesia, and the Sarinah shopping centre to transform Jakarta from a former colonial backwater to a modern city. The modern Jakarta boulevards of Jalan Thamrin, Jalan Sudirman, and Jalan Gatot Subroto was planned and constructed under Sukarno.\n\nAs Sukarno\'s domestic authority was secured, he began to pay more attention to the world stage. He embarked on a series of aggressive and assertive policies based on anti-imperialism to increase Indonesia\'s international prestige. These anti-imperialist and anti-Western policies, often employing brinkmanship with other nations, were also designed to unite the diverse and fractious Indonesian people. In this, he was aided by his Foreign Minister Subandrio.\n\nAfter his first visit to Beijing in 1956, Sukarno began to strengthen his ties to the People\'s Republic of China and the communist bloc in general. He also began to accept increasing amounts of Soviet bloc military aid. By the early 1960s, the Soviet bloc provided more aid to Indonesia than to any other non-communist country, while Soviet military aid to Indonesia was equalled only by its aid to Cuba. This large influx of communist aid prompted an increase in military aid from the Dwight Eisenhower and John F. Kennedy Administrations, which worried about a leftward drift should Sukarno rely too much on Soviet bloc aid.[30]\n\nSukarno was feted during his visit to the United States in 1956, where he addressed a joint session of United States Congress. Soon after his first visit to America, Sukarno visited the Soviet Union, where he received an even more lavish welcome. Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev paid a return visit to Jakarta and Bali in 1960, where he awarded Sukarno with the Lenin Peace Prize. To make amends for CIA involvement in the PRRI-Permesta rebellion, US President Kennedy invited Sukarno to Washington, D.C. and provided Indonesia with billions of dollars in civilian and military aid.[30]\n\nTo follow up on the successful 1955 Bandung Conference, Sukarno attempted to forge a new alliance called the \"New Emerging Forces\" (NEFO), as a counter to the Western superpowers dubbed the \"Old Established Forces\" (OLDEFO), whom he accused of spreading \"Neo-Colonialism and Imperialism\" (NEKOLIM). In 1961, Sukarno established another political alliance, called the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM, in Indonesia known as Gerakan Non-Blok, GNB) with Egypt\'s President Gamal Abdel Nasser, India\'s Prime Minister Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, Yugoslavia\'s President Josip Broz Tito, and Ghana\'s President Kwame Nkrumah, in an action called The Initiative of Five (Sukarno, Nkrumah, Nasser, Tito, and Nehru). NAM was intended to provide political unity and influence for nations who wished to maintain independence from the American and Soviet superpower blocs, which were engaged in Cold War competition. Sukarno is still fondly remembered for his role in promoting the influence of newly independent countries. His name is used as a street name in Cairo, Egypt and Rabat, Morocco, and as a major square in Peshawar, Pakistan. In 1956, the University of Belgrade awarded him an honorary doctorate.\n\nIn 1960 Sukarno began an aggressive foreign policy to secure Indonesian territorial claims. In August of that year, Sukarno broke off diplomatic relations with the Netherlands over the continuing failure to commence talks on the future of Netherlands New Guinea, as was agreed at the Dutch-Indonesian Round Table Conference of 1949. In April 1961 the Dutch announced the formation of a Nieuw Guinea Raad, with the intention of creating an independent Papuan state. Sukarno declared a state of military confrontation in his Tri Komando Rakjat (TRIKORA) speech in Yogyakarta, on 19 December 1961. He then directed military incursions into the half-island, which he referred to as West Irian. By end of 1962 3,000 Indonesian soldiers were present throughout West Irian/West Papua.\n\nA naval battle erupted in January 1962 when four Indonesian torpedo boats were intercepted by Dutch ships and planes off the coast of Vlakke Hoek. One Indonesian boat was sunk, killing the Naval Deputy Chief-of-Staff Commodore Jos Sudarso. Meanwhile, the Kennedy Administration worried of a continuing Indonesian shift towards communism should the Dutch hold on to West Irian/West Papua. In February 1962 US Attorney General Robert Kennedy travelled to the Netherlands and informed the government that the United States would not support the Netherlands in an armed conflict with Indonesia. With Soviet armaments and advisors, Sukarno planned a large-scale air- and seaborne invasion of the Dutch military headquarters of Biak for August 1962, called Operasi Djajawidjaja. It was to be led by Major-General Suharto, the future President of Indonesia. Before these plans could be realised, Indonesia and Netherlands signed the New York Agreement in August 1962. The two countries agreed to implement the Bunker Plan (formulated by American diplomat Ellsworth Bunker), whereby the Dutch agreed to hand over West Irian/West Papua to UNTEA on 1 October 1962. UNTEA transferred the territory to Indonesian authority in May 1963.\n\nAfter securing control over West Irian/West Papua, Sukarno then opposed the British-supported establishment of the Federation of Malaysia in 1963, claiming that it was a neo-colonial plot by the British to undermine Indonesia. Despite Sukarno\'s political overtures, which found some support when leftist political elements in British Borneo territories Sarawak and Brunei opposed the Federation plan and aligned themselves with Sukarno, Malaysia was established in September 1963. This was followed by the IndonesiaMalaysia confrontation (Konfrontasi), proclaimed by Sukarno in his Dwi Komando Rakjat (DWIKORA) speech in Jakarta on 3 May 1964. Sukarno\'s proclaimed objective was not, as some alleged, to annex Sabah and Sarawak into Indonesia, but to establish a \"State of North Kalimantan\" under the control of North Kalimantan Communist Party. From 1964 until early 1966, a limited number of Indonesian soldiers, civilians, and Malaysian communist guerrillas were sent into North Borneo and the Malay Peninsula. These forces fought with British and Commonwealth soldiers deployed to protect the nascent state of Malaysia. Indonesian agents also exploded several bombs in Singapore. Domestically, Sukarno fomented anti-British sentiment and the British Embassy was burned down. In 1964, all British companies operating in the country, including Indonesian operations of the Chartered Bank and Unilever, were nationalized. The confrontation came to a climax during the winter of 1964, when Sukarno authorized landings of Indonesian troops at Pontian and Labis on the Malaysian mainland, and all-out war seemed inevitable as tensions escalated. However, the situation calmed over the winter at the culmination of the Sunda Straits Crisis, and after the disastrous Battle of Plaman Mapu in April 1965, Indonesian raids into Sarawak became fewer and weaker.\n\nIn 1964 Sukarno commenced an anti-American campaign, which was motivated by his shift towards the communist bloc and less friendly relations with the Lyndon Johnson Administration. American interests and businesses in Indonesia were denounced by government officials and attacked by PKI-led mobs. American movies were banned, American books and Beatles albums were burned, and the Indonesian band Koes Plus was jailed for playing American-style rock and roll music. As a result, US aid to Indonesia was halted, to which Sukarno made his famous remark, \"Go to hell with your aid\". Sukarno withdrew Indonesia from the United Nations on 7 January 1965 when, with US backing, Malaysia took a seat on UN Security Council.\n\nAs the NAM countries were becoming split into different factions, and as fewer countries were willing to support his anti-Western foreign policies, Sukarno began to abandon his non-alignment rhetoric. Sukarno formed a new alliance with China, North Korea, North Vietnam, and Cambodia which he called the \"Beijing-Pyongyang-Hanoi-Phnom Penh-Jakarta Axis\". After withdrawing Indonesia from the \"imperialist-dominated\" United Nations in January 1965, Sukarno sought to establish a competitor organization to the UN called the Conference of New Emerging Forces (CONEFO) with support from China, who at that time was not yet a member of United Nations.[citation needed] With the government heavily indebted to the Soviet Union, Indonesia became increasingly dependent on China for support.[31] Sukarno spoke increasingly of a Beijing-Jakarta axis,[31] which would be the core of a new anti-imperialist world organization, the CONEFO.[citation needed]\n\nDomestically, Sukarno continued to consolidate his control. He was made president for life by the MPRS in 1963. His ideological writings on Manipol-USDEK and NASAKOM became mandatory subjects in Indonesian schools and universities, while his speeches were to be memorized and discussed by all students. All newspapers, the only radio station (RRI), and the only television station (TVRI) were made into \"tools of the revolution\" and functioned to spread Sukarno\'s messages. Sukarno developed a personality cult, with the capital of newly acquired West Irian renamed to Sukarnapura and the highest peak in the country was renamed from Carstensz Pyramid to Puntjak Sukarno (Sukarno Peak).\n\nDespite these appearances of unchallenged control, Sukarno\'s guided democracy stood on fragile grounds due to the inherent conflict between its two underlying support pillars, the military and the communists. The military, nationalists, and the Islamic groups were shocked by the rapid growth of the communist party under Sukarno\'s protection. They feared an imminent establishment of a communist state in Indonesia. By 1965, the PKI had 3million members, and were particularly strong in Central Java and Bali. PKI had become the strongest party in Indonesia.\n\nThe military and nationalists were growing wary of Sukarno\'s close alliance with communist China, which they thought compromised Indonesia\'s sovereignty. Elements of the military disagreed with Sukarno\'s policy of confrontation with Malaysia, which in their view only benefited communists, and sent several officers (including future Armed Forces Chief Leonardus Benjamin Moerdani) to spread secret peace-feelers to the Malaysian government. The Islamic clerics, who were mostly landowners, felt threatened by PKI\'s land confiscation actions (aksi sepihak) in the countryside and by the communist campaign against the \"seven village devils\", a term used for landlords or better-off farmers (similar to the anti-kulak campaign in Stalinist era). Both groups harbored deep disdain for PKI in particular due to memories of the bloody 1948 communist rebellion.\n\nAs the mediator of the three groups under the NASAKOM system, Sukarno displayed greater sympathies to the communists. The PKI had been very careful to support all of Sukarno\'s policies. Meanwhile, Sukarno saw the PKI as the best-organised and ideologically solid party in Indonesia, and a useful conduit to gain more military and financial aid from Communist Bloc countries. Sukarno also sympathised with the communists\' revolutionary ideals, which were similar to his own.\n\nTo weaken the influence of the military, Sukarno rescinded martial law (which gave wide-ranging powers to the military) in 1963. In September 1962, he \"promoted\" the powerful General Nasution to the less-influential position of Armed Forces Chief, while the influential position of Army Chief was given to Sukarno\'s loyalist Ahmad Yani. Meanwhile, the position of Air Force Chief was given to Omar Dhani, who was an open communist sympathiser. In May 1964, Sukarno banned activities of Manifesto Kebudajaan (Manikebu), an association of artists and writers which included prominent Indonesian writers such as Hans Bague Jassin and Wiratmo Soekito, who were also dismissed from their jobs. Manikebu was considered a rival by the communist writer\'s association Lembaga Kebudajaan Rakjat (Lekra), led by Pramoedya Ananta Toer. In December 1964, Sukarno disbanded the Badan Pendukung Soekarnoisme (BPS), the \"Association for Promoting Sukarnoism\", an organisation that sought to oppose communism by invoking Sukarno\'s own Pancasila formulation. In January 1965, Sukarno, under pressure from PKI, banned the Murba Party. Murba was a Trotskyite party whose ideology was antagonistic to PKI\'s orthodox line of Marxism.[32]\n\nTensions between the military and communists increased in April 1965, when PKI chairman Aidit called for the formation of a \"fifth armed force\" consisting of armed peasants and labor. Sukarno approved this idea and publicly called for the immediate formation of such a force on 17 May 1965. However, this idea was rejected by Army Chief Ahmad Yani and Defence Minister Nasution, as this was tantamount to allowing the PKI to establish its own armed forces. Soon after this rejection, on 29 May, the \"Gilchrist Letter\" appeared. The letter was supposedly written by the British ambassador Andrew Gilchrist to the Foreign Office in London, mentioning a joint American and British attempt on subversion in Indonesia with the help of \"local army friends\". This letter, produced by Subandrio, aroused Sukarno\'s fear of a military plot to overthrow him, a fear which he mentioned repeatedly during the next few months. The Czechoslovakian agent Ladislav Bittman who defected in 1968 claimed that his agency (StB) forged the letter on request from PKI via Soviet Union, to smear anti-communist generals. On his independence day speech of 17 August 1965, Sukarno declared his intention to commit Indonesia to an anti-imperialist alliance with China and other communist regimes, and warned the Army not to interfere. He also stated his support for the establishment of \"fifth force\" of armed peasants and labor.[33]\n\nWhile Sukarno devoted his energy to domestic and international politics, the economy of Indonesia was neglected and deteriorated rapidly. The government printed money to finance its military expenditures, resulting in hyperinflation exceeding 600% per annum in 19641965. Smuggling and collapse of export plantation sectors deprived the government of much-needed foreign exchange income. Consequently, the government was unable to service massive foreign debts it accumulated from both Western and Communist bloc countries. Most of the government budget was spent on the military, resulting in deterioration of infrastructure such as roads, railways, ports, and other public facilities. Deteriorating transportation infrastructure and poor harvests caused food shortages in many places. The small industrial sector languished and only produced at 20% capacity due to lack of investment.\n\nSukarno himself was contemptuous of macroeconomics, and was unable and unwilling to provide practical solutions to the poor economic condition of the country. Instead, Sukarno produced more ideological conceptions such as Trisakti: political sovereignty, economic self-sufficiency, and cultural independence. He advocated Indonesians to be \"standing on their own feet\" (berdikari) and reach economic self-sufficiency, free from foreign influence.[34]\n\nTowards the end of his rule, Sukarno\'s lack of interest in economics created a distance between himself and the Indonesian people, who were suffering economically.[35] His face had become bloated by disease and his flamboyance and sexual conquests  which had once endeared him to the people  caused public criticism and turned support towards the army.\n\nOn the dawn of 1 October 1965, six of Indonesia\'s most senior army generals were kidnapped and killed by a movement calling themselves the \"30 September Movement\" (G30S). Among those killed was Ahmad Yani, while Nasution narrowly escaped, but the movement kidnapped First Lieutenant Pierre Tendean, his military aide; presumably mistaking him for General Nasution in the darkness. The G30S Movement consisted of members of the Presidential Guards, Brawidjaja Division, and Diponegoro Division, under the command of a Lieutenant-Colonel Untung bin Sjamsuri, a known communist sympathiser who participated in the 1948 PKI rebellion. The movement took control of the radio station and the Merdeka Square. They broadcast a statement declaring the kidnappings were meant to protect Sukarno from a coup attempt by CIA-influenced generals. Later, it broadcast news of the disbandment of Sukarno\'s cabinet, to be replaced by a \"Revolutionary Council\". In Central Java, soldiers associated with the Movement also seized control of Yogyakarta and Solo on 12 October, killing two colonels in the process.\n\nMajor General Suharto, commander of the Army\'s strategic reserve command, took control of the army the following morning.[36] Suharto ordered troops to take over the radio station of Radio Republik Indonesia and Merdeka Square itself. On the afternoon of that day, Suharto issued an ultimatum to the Halim Air Force Base, where the G30S had based themselves and where Sukarno (the reasons for his presence are unclear and were subject of claim and counter-claim), Air Marshal Omar Dhani, and PKI chairman Aidit had gathered. By the following day, it was clear that the incompetently organised and poorly coordinated coup had failed. Sukarno took up residence in the Bogor Palace, while Omar Dhani fled to East Java and Aidit to Central Java.[37] By 2 October, Suharto\'s soldiers occupied Halim Air Force Base, after a short gunfight. Sukarno\'s obedience to Suharto\'s 1 October ultimatum to leave Halim is seen as changing all power relationships.[38] Sukarno\'s fragile balance of power between the military, political Islam, communists, and nationalists that underlay his \"Guided Democracy\" was now collapsing.[37] On 3 October, the corpses of the kidnapped generals were discovered near the Halim Air Force Base, and on 5 October they were buried in a public ceremony led by Suharto.\n\nIn early October 1965, a military propaganda campaign began to sweep the country, successfully convincing both Indonesian and international audiences that it was a Communist coup, and that the murders were cowardly atrocities against Indonesian heroes since those who were shot were veteran military officers.[39] The PKI\'s denials of involvement had little effect.[40] Following the discovery and public burial of the generals\' corpses on 5 October, the army along with Islamic organisations Muhammadiyah and Nahdlatul Ulama, led a campaign to purge Indonesian society, government and armed forces of the communist party and other leftist organisations. Leading PKI members were immediately arrested, some summarily executed. Aidit was captured and killed in November 1965.[39] The purge spread across the country with the worst massacres in Java and Bali.[40] In some areas the army organised civilian groups and local militias, in other areas communal vigilante action preceded the army.[41] The most widely accepted estimates are that at least half a million were killed.[42] It is thought that as many as 1.5million were imprisoned at one stage or another.[43]\n\nAs a result of the purge, one of Sukarno\'s three pillars of support, the Indonesian Communist Party, had been effectively eliminated by the other two, the military and political Islam. The killings and the failure of his tenuous \"revolution\" distressed Sukarno and he tried unsuccessfully to protect the PKI by referring to the generals\' killings as a rimpeltje in de oceaan (\"ripple in the sea of the revolution\"). He tried to maintain his influence appealing in a January 1966 broadcast for the country to follow him. Subandrio sought to create a Sukarnoist column (Barisan Sukarno), which was undermined by Suharto\'s pledge of loyalty to Sukarno and the concurrent instruction for all those loyal to Sukarno to announce their support for the army.[44]\n\nOn 1 October 1965, Sukarno appointed General Pranoto Reksosamudro as Army Chief to replace the dead Ahmad Yani, but he was forced to give this position to Suharto two weeks later. In February 1966, Sukarno reshuffled his cabinet, sacking Nasution as Defence Minister and abolishing his position of armed forces chief of staff, but Nasution refused to step down. Beginning in January 1966, university students started demonstrating against Sukarno, demanding the disbandment of PKI and for the government to control spiraling inflation. In February 1966, student demonstrators in front of Merdeka Palace were shot at by Presidential Guards, killing the student Arief Rachman Hakim, who was quickly turned into a martyr by student demonstrators.\n\nA meeting of Sukarno\'s full cabinet was held at the Merdeka Palace on 11 March 1966. As students were demonstrating against the administration, unidentified troops began to assemble outside. Sukarno, Subandrio and another minister immediately left the meeting and went to the Bogor Palace by helicopter. Three pro-Suharto generals (Basuki Rahmat, Amirmachmud, and Mohammad Jusuf) were dispatched to the Bogor palace and they met with Sukarno who signed for them a Presidential Order known as Supersemar. Through the order, Sukarno assigned Suharto to \"take all measures considered necessary to guarantee security, calm and stability of the government and the revolution and to guarantee the personal safety and authority [of Sukarno]\". The authorship of the document, and whether Sukarno was forced to sign, perhaps even at gunpoint, is a point of historic debate. The effect of the order, however, was the transfer of authority to Suharto. After obtaining the Presidential Order, Suharto had the PKI declared illegal and the party was abolished. He also arrested many high-ranking officials that were loyal to Sukarno on the charge of being PKI members and/or sympathizers, further reducing Sukarno\'s political power and influence.\n\nThe MPRS, now purged from communist and pro-Sukarno elements, began proceedings to impeach Sukarno on the grounds of the following:\n\nOn 22 June 1966, Sukarno made the Nawaksara speech in front of the MPRS session, an unsuccessful last-ditch attempt to defend himself and his guided democracy system. In August 1966, over Sukarno\'s objections, Indonesia ended its confrontation with Malaysia and rejoined the United Nations. After making another unsuccessful accountability speech (Nawaksara Addendum) on 10 January 1967, Sukarno was stripped of his president-for-life title by MPRS on 12 March 1967, in a session chaired by his former ally, Nasution. He was put under house arrest in Bogor Palace, where his health deteriorated due to denial of adequate medical care. He died of kidney failure in Jakarta Army Hospital on 21 June 1970 at age 69. He was buried in Blitar, East Java, Indonesia.\n\nSukarno was of Javanese and Balinese descent. Sukarno married Siti Oetari in 1920, and divorced her in 1923 to marry Inggit Garnasih, whom he divorced c. 1943 to marry Fatmawati.[46] Sukarno also married Hartini in 1954, after which he and Fatmawati separated without divorcing. In 1959, he was introduced to the then 19-year-old Japanese hostess Naoko Nemoto, whom he married in 1962 and renamed Ratna Dewi Sukarno.[47] Sukarno also married four other spouses: Haryati (19631966); Kartini Manoppo (19591968); Yurike Sanger (19641968); Heldy Djafar (19661969).\n\nMegawati Sukarnoputri, who served as the fifth president of Indonesia, is his daughter by his wife Fatmawati. Her younger brother Guruh Sukarnoputra (born 1953) has inherited Sukarno\'s artistic bent and is a choreographer and songwriter, who made a movie Untukmu, Indonesiaku (For You, My Indonesia) about Indonesian culture. He is also a member of the Indonesian People\'s Representative Council for Megawati\'s Indonesian Democratic Party  Struggle. His siblings Guntur Sukarnoputra, Rachmawati Sukarnoputri and Sukmawati Sukarnoputri have all been active in politics. Sukarno had a daughter named Kartika by Dewi Sukarno.[48] In 2006 Kartika Sukarno married Frits Seegers, the Netherlands-born chief executive officer of the Barclays Global Retail and Commercial Bank.[49] Other offspring include Taufan and Bayu by his wife Hartini, and a son named Toto Suryawan Soekarnoputra (born 1967, in Germany), by his wife Kartini Manoppo.\n\nSukarno was awarded twenty-six honorary doctorates from various international universities including Columbia University, the University of Michigan, the University of Berlin, the Al-Azhar University, the University of Belgrade, the Lomonosov University and many more, and also from domestic universities including the Universitas Gadjah Mada, the Universitas Indonesia, the Bandung Institute of Technology, and the Universitas Padjadjaran.

Hoaxes are found in almost every era, from President Soekarno to President Jokowi. Fake news often duped both the people and government officials.\n\nA historian at the Indonesian Institute of Sciences (LIPI) Asvi Warman Adam said there are many motives behind fake news circulation, ranging from inciting outrage to personal gain.\n\nFake news stories also concerned President Joko Widodo. Meanwhile, the Indonesian Ulema Council (MUI) had planned to issue guidelines for ethical behavior on social media.\n\nThe following are high-profile hoaxes that tricked Indonesian presidents, as quoted by Koran Tempo\'s January 23rd edition.\n\nMarried couple Idrus and Markonah claimed to be the King and Queen of Suku Anak Dalam indigenous people in Sumatra in the 1950s. They embarked tours to regions across Indonesia in support of West Irian liberation from Dutch imperialism.\n\nThe Palace heard the news. They were invited by a state official to meet with President Soekarno who needed support to liberate West Irian. Idrus and Markonah met with President Soekarno and were treated like honorable guests.\n\nTheir identity was revealed when they had a walk in a market in Jakarta. A pedicab driver identified the two since Idrus was his fellow pedicab driver. Markonah was a sex worker. It was the first high-profile hoax that duped Indonesian president.\n\nIn the 1970s, an unborn child of Acehnese women Cut Zahara Fona was said to be capable of talking and reciting the Quran. The info shook Indonesia and made it to the newspapers. State official Adam Malik and the first lady Tien Soeharto were also aware of the news. Both summoned Cut Zahara to the Presidential Palace.\n\nAdam and Tien personally heard Cut Zahara\'s unborn child recite the Quran. The news got even bigger. But a physician named Herman did not believe it, noting that a fetus could not breathe nor make a sound. Consequently, Herman was threatened to be killed by Cut Zaharas sympathizers. Her lies were finally revealed: she put a tape recorder on her belly.\n\nIn 2002, the Religious Affairs Minister Said Agil Al Munawar claimed that he was told about treasures belonging to Prabu Siliwangi, the King of Padjadjaran, in Batu Tulis, Bogor. He forwarded the info to Megawati. Megawati appointed Said Agil as the leader to dig out the treasures that were said to be enough to pay off the national debts. Said Agil later stopped the excavation. No treasure was found.\n\nThe news about water to fuel conversion (blue energy) in 2008 broke out. The inventor Joko Suprapto presented his innovation before President SBY, securing Rp10 billion to build theblue energy plant in Cikeas, Bogor. The invention was slammed by many, including the Gadjah Mada University, who said that it was all lies. Joko later apologized for being unable to turn water into fuel. He was later named a suspect by Yogyakarta Police.\n\nNews reporting about 10 million Chinese migrant workers entering Indonesia surfaced in both social media and online media at the end of 2016. The government dismissed the rumor, citing that Indonesia only houses 21,000 Chinese migrant workers of a total 74,000 foreign workers. The fake news story prompted President Joko Widodo to revive the plan to establish the National Cyber Agency.

This is something that has sparked a lot of intrigue around the Internet. Apparently, it originated back in August of 2009 in Prattville, AL when a woman saw her everyday, average broom standing straight up without anything holding it or securing it. It was simply balancing perfectly on its bristles. Since then, the phenomenon has been documented in many other places all over the globe, and the theories about why this is happening have gotten quite ambitious. It has been blamed on planetary alignments, magnetic pole shifts, increased solar activity, and even some nonsense about Mercury and retrograde motion. As more and more reports of standing brooms sweep the nation (no pun intended), we at Common Sense Conspiracy decided it was time to take a closer look.\n\nThe first thing you might want to note about these videos and still pictures is the similarities. While the mysterious standing brooms come in all sizes and colors, they all share a few characteristics. All of them are brooms where the bristles form a flat, horizontal surface at the bottom of the broom. Notice the absence of any angled brooms. Coincidence? Not at all. Angled brooms are not featured in any of these videos because you are not going to get an angled broom to stand up on its own without any outside force helping out. You will find angled brooms standing up, but most of them look fake from the start. So, are we implying that flat brooms can stand up? Absolutely.\n\nNow, not every broom that has a flat bottom can stand up. Notice that most of the brooms you see doing this are either quite new or in excellent shape. That means that the bristles are still strong and have not been worn down so that the bristles are very different in length. From there, it is simply a not-so-superhuman feat of finding the brooms center of gravity. Sure, it takes a soft choice and an elementary knowledge of physics, but our investigation revealed that anyone can do it, given the right broom. While it does look pretty cool, we have to admit, it is hardly any phenomenon of nature, except for that one we call physics.\n\nSome of the theories have even suggested that there are only certain times of the day where the brooms will stand. These theories are absolutely correct, because the only time of day the brooms will be standing like this is when the owner carefully stands it up, perfectly balancing it along its center of gravity. However, the laws of physics do not change across day or night, so the odds of getting any broom to stand on its end do not improve by the time of day, position of the sun or planets, or any spooky incantations you might utter while trying to make it happen.\n\nSo, is this a hoax? Well, not really. It is true that it can be done. The deception comes in the creation of the illusion that the brooms are doing this all by themselves. It implies that the brooms at some point just move themselves to this position. However, you will find zero video evidence (at least reputable, undoctored videos) to corroborate this. This whole adventure probably started when the woman in Prattville accidentally placed the broom perfectly on its center of balance when she was done with it. Or perhaps one of her kids passed through and performed the feat for her to witness later. In any case, all of the stories you hear are bent in some way to make this seem even more supernatural and paranormal. For those of you still wondering what the hell we are talking about, here is the video that supposedly started it all:\n\n\n\nWhen someone shows us a broom that moves to this position all by itself and then lifts itself off the ground, having no contact in any direction, then we will be happy to report a real paranormal event.\n\nEDIT: It has been brought to our attention by our loyal readers that many have found that an angled broom is just as easy to stand up as any other. Common Sense Conspiracy has performed some more experiments, and we still feel that the condition of the brooms bristles is definitely a factor in this, but be aware that this can be done on any day. There is nothing special going on any particular day or time that makes this possible. If you dont think so, do it over and over again at different times of the year. If this were truly a natural phenomenon, you would be able to do other objects as well. While the planets do have effects on the Earth as a whole planet, they most certainly do not exhibit any effect over objects as small as a broom. Also, this is a recurring urban legend for years. It has gone through different forms. Obviously the broom is the popular one of the moment, but historically, the same rumors were spread about standing an ordinary egg on its end. And, yes, you can stand an egg up to. How about some user-contributed photos in the comment section of a freestanding broom next to a freestanding egg. Common Sense Conspiracy will publish any such photo ops on our front page, so get to it Also, anyone that posts a pic of a standing broom and standing egg gets a free copy of the novel Crisis Point.

SeeExample(s)\n\nFacebook has been running wild this with pictures of brooms standing up by themselves & eggs standing up on end. Everyone is saying this is due to planetary alignment and the way the earth is tilted on its axis this week only. Is it true that the equinox can cause a broom to obtain the right amount of gravitational pull to allow it to stand on its own or is it simply a balancing act?\n\nEvery year on the vernal and autumnal equinoxes (on or about March 20 and September 22), the two days per year in which the length of day and night are the same, we hear about a magical property of these days that allows eggs to be balanced on end. Rarely does a year go by in which a local TV news station doesnt send a reporter out to a neighborhood park to capture images of people delightedly placing eggs on the ground and watching in amazement as the eggs stand on end. Rarely do we see any new stories reporting that this same feat can be achieved every other day of the year as well.\n\nThe equinoxes, which mark the beginning of spring and autumn, have long held a special importance in human society. Particularly the vernal equinox, which marks the first day of spring and the end of winter, the beginning of the season in which daylight again outlasts darkness and life springs anew. Flowers blossom, trees shoot out new leaves and branches, and animals give birth (or their eggs hatch). These tangible signs of the worlds rebirth were of paramount importance to agricultural societies, and they naturally developed elaborate fertility rites to celebrate the occasion.\n\nThus of the most ubiquitous symbols of fertility and long been associated with the beginning of spring, and hence with the equinox. Many, many superstitions involving the breaking, balancing, burying, decorating, reading (for purposes of divination) and hiding of eggs have come to be part of the annual spring celebration. (The linking of egg-balancing with spring celebrations is demonstrated by the fact that the practice is associated primarily with the vernal equinox and far less commonly with the autumnal equinox.)\n\nThe Chinese are often cited as having originated the practice of standing eggs on end during the equinox. Just as the equinox symbolically restores balance to the world by signalling its rebirth after a season of darkness, the equinox literally balances the day by dividing it into equal portions of darkness and light. If the symbol of fertility, eggs, could be balanced on end during a day equally divided between day and night, this was a sign that all nature was in harmony.\n\nNonetheless, the vernal equinox brings no special egg-balancing properties with it. Standing an egg on its end is something just about anyone can do any day of the year; the feat simply takes the right egg and a little trial and practice. Since the vast majority of people never see or try balancing eggs on their ends on any day other than the equinox, though, many of them come away from the experience believing that something special must have occurred on that particular day. As the Associated Press reported in 1987, however, scientific trial shows otherwise:\n\nEgg balancing, most popular at the spring equinox in March but said to be possible in both seasons, has attracted publicity in recent years  with scientists skeptical and ritual-makers adamant. Finally a scientist has published research into the matter and concluded that yes indeed, he could balance an egg  actually several eggs  at the moment of the equinox. But, on the other side of the coin, he was also able to do so at lots of other times. The upshot is that, as far as I can tell, there isnt too much relationship between astronomical phenomena and balancing eggs. It is basically a function of the shape of the egg and the surface, said astronomer Frank D. Ghigo. Ghigo, of the University of Minnesota, decided to study egg balancing after receiving questions about it from members of the public who had read about the annual spring egg balancing festival in New York City. Ghigo used four samples of a dozen eggs each, which he attempted to balance on their large ends on a Formica tabletop each day between and April 3, 1984. The spring equinox occurred on March 20, 1984. Ghigo found the eggs have many bumps and irregularities and with patience some of them could be made to balance virtually every day  while some eggs would simply never balance, on the equinox or otherwise. He concluded that the mood and persistence of the balancer has a major effect on the balancing rate. If one is impatient or nervous, the rate is low. Over time, Ghigo found, the percentage of eggs he could balance improved, concluding I think I got better, just through practice.\n\nThe following video clip shows an egg being balanced on end during a non-equinox day:\n\nFebruary 2012 saw the widespread promotion of a more recent wrinkle to the legend: pictures of brooms standing on end circulated via social media, accompanied by claims that the arrival of the equinox also brought special broom-balancing properties with it. Just like eggs, though, many brooms can be stood on their ends any old day of the year. The feat works best with newer brooms which have uniform, evenly cut bristles, with the angle of the bristle cut offsetting the lean angle of the broom:','2017-03-25 03:51:13'),(422,56,'5d66926bdc9fbc01541f969327cc25e69e6217bdb10c29b8d8f8dbd5283ed1fd','8b17810ecd594de2a8a10f5a49e177f6','','','Did you know that the Pope endorsed Donald Trump? Admittedly, there are many reasons you might have missed this particular piece of information, not least the fact its not true. How about Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly being sacked for supporting Hillary Clinton? Also false. Yet during the US election fake news spread so widely that even senior politicians regurgitated its main themes: Go online and put down Hillary Clinton illness and take a look at the videos yourself, the Trump supporter Rudy Giuliani told Fox News in August. He was referring to a long-standing conspiracy theory that she was concealing a diagnosis of Parkinsons disease.\n\nWhat drives these online rumour mills? Since the election, a large part of the blame has fallen on Facebook, where the Megyn Kelly rumour trended in August soon after the company sacked its human moderators and replaced them with an algorithm. Simply, fake news exists because it makes money. Between them, Facebook and Google control 64 per cent of the digital advertising market, and its possible to make a good living by running a parasitical Facebook page filled with content scraped from other websites. Strongly partisan political content is particularly well suited to this model. As the former Facebook product designer Bobby Goodlatte put it: Sadly, [Facebooks]News Feed optimises for engagement. As weve learned in this election, bullshit is highly engaging.\n\nTrump (and, to a lesser extent, Bernie Sanders) has many fans who are convinced that the mainstream media are biased and corrupt. And, responding to these voters desire to read what the MSM wont tell you  often because it wasnt true  came a legion of chancers intent on making a quick buck. In one case uncovered by BuzzFeed, 100 pro-Trump pages were being run by teenagers in one town in Macedonia; in another example in the New York Times, a 35-year-old man from St Louis was making $22,000 a month by outsourcing content production to a couple in the Philippines.\n\nI chased one source of the Pope news to a website called wtoe5news.com, which sells itself as Your local news now. The site itself was a hollow shell. Clicking on the Weather tab brought up a video headlined Jay Pharoah Acts Out a Secret Meeting Between Black Comedians; under Community was Ben Affleck looking sad. The whole site seemed to exist only to surround the Pope story with plausible architecture. Although lets be realistic: among the 99,000 people who shared it on Facebook, how many clicked through to WTOE5, as opposed to just reading the headline and hitting Share? Tucked away on the About page was a disclaimer: Most articles on wtoe5news.com are satire or pure fantasy.\n\nFacebook is trying to remove hoax and satire sites such as this one; recent changes to its news feed have downgraded them in favour of more established outlets. A more difficult case is something like the American Patriot page, which has more than 500,000 followers and has a grey verified tick, certifying that Facebook has confirmed this is an authentic page for this business or organisation. The Patriots stories skirt the edge of total bollocks, rather than being flat-out lies. Christmas lights now banned as security threat, says one. Everyone Noticed One Thing About Hillarys Clothes During Her Concession Speech, says another.\n\nFacebook would argue that its verification mark is no reflection on the quality of stories, just that they are coming from the organisation named on the page. But its hard to see American Patriot as a news organisation in the way that the BBC is. Still, is it Facebooks place to make editorial judgements like that? Mark Zuckerberg says no; he has always maintained that he runs a platform, not a publisher.\n\nAnd theres another problem. The sites peddling bullshit on Facebook are disproportionately right-wing. They are a extension of the alternative media  Fox News, talk radio, Breitbart  built by conservatives over two decades to redress what they saw as the liberal bias of the mainstream. If Facebook goes after fake news in a big way, it will disproportionately affect right-wing pages. And if you put that together with a site that is petrified about appearing biased (and has a prominent Trump supporter, Peter Thiel, on its board), what happens? A retreat into objectivity that actually benefits the right.\n\nSome will say: why all this focus on Facebook when the mainstream media also publish misleading articles? The first reason is the sites sheer size (1.7 billion users) and reach (44 per cent of us get our news there). Admittedly, the rest of the media are also irritated that Facebook is taking digital advertising dollars that might have replaced their own falling print revenues. They wouldnt mind it being taken down a peg or two.\n\nOn Facebook, there is also far less visibility and accountability. When the Sun and the Mail published a false tale about Jeremy Corbyn dancing a jig on Remembrance Sunday, they were forced to remove the stories after an outcry. Crucially, enough people saw the fake news, and knew whom to complain to, for it to be taken down. That process is much harder on the sprawling, decentralised world of social networks.\n\nFacebook is also where politics happens now. It is vital for fundraising  the Trump campaign said it was their single most important source of donations  and its built-in tools for advertisers allow endless A/B testing of messages to find the perfect one that resonates with voters. For those who wondered where Trumps ground game was  his Get Out the Vote operation  theres a simple answer: Facebook.\n\nAs for the Pope, two days before the election, he warned about fear, intolerance and physical or social walls. So probably not a huge Trump supporter, then.','2017-03-25 03:51:13'),(423,56,'5d66926bdc9fbc01541f969327cc25e69e6217bdb10c29b8d8f8dbd5283ed1fd','ca68d4cb871749f6ad4fa0b10a93e4a6','','','A Facebook postgoingvirally across the social media site thatshows what looks to be a Messenger chat Mark Zuckerbergs agreeing to remove presidential candidate Donald Trump from Facebook if that screenshot can accumulate over 500,000 likes, 50,000 comments and 20,000 shares.\n\nDespite the post getting plenty of attention, most online sources claim it is clearly fake, given that Zuckerberg and Facebook are always closely monitored and often criticized over the controversial subject of freedom of speech and censorship.\n\nHuffingtonPost reported that thepost hadbeen deleted after Callan Brown posted a statement revealing that the conversation was fake.\n\nThe chances that the highly-visible CEO will publicly grant the wish of a random Facebook user to remove a presidential candidate from Facebook if a post can accumulate an arbitrary number of social media engagement is, to say the least, highly unlikely, an online blog reports.\n\nAside from the post, theres a google chrome extension that is also available for download dubbed, Remove Donald Trump from Facebook Homepage.

But Democratic rival Hillary Clinton has her own pockets of strength  notably YouTube, which showcases highly produced campaign videos. And she\'s got a presence where Trump is nearly absent, including Snapchat and LinkedIn.\n\nSocial media has made a bigger impact in this election cycle than any other in history, both for breaking news and as a way for citizens to directly connect to candidates. The nomineesrespond to each other on Twitter, pump up followers on Facebook, and use YouTube to replay stump speeches and showcase campaign ads. It all serves to amplify traditional campaign-trail rallies and produce a huge source of material for the news cycle.\n\nConflict sells, says Michael Cornfield, an associate professor at George Washington University, about why Trumps tweet rants have been so covered by the media.\n\nTake Trump\'srecent spat with the parents of a soldier who died in combat. Itescalated on Twitter after the father, Khizr Khan,criticized Trump at the Democratic National Convention.\n\nThe styles couldn\'t be more different.Trump hasa brasher styleand clearly crafts most of his tweets. Clinton\'s posts tend to be soundbites from her campaign, and many appear created by a social media team. He oftenuses the platform to settle scores and blast people, while hers are less personalized and more aspirational (though sometimes she takes a dig at Trump.)\n\nThe media loves tweets, says Jayson DeMers, founder of AudienceBloom, a firm that helps companies with their social media strategies. They are short, easy to talk about, and and simple to put up on a TV screen.\n\nIn terms of shear numbers, Trump has 22.7 million likes and followers on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, to Clinton\'s combined 15 million. He\'s noticed.\"I\'m head and shoulders above everyone else,\" on social media,he told the Washington Post this week.\n\nBut Clinton is far ahead when it comes to YouTube, where her political ads have drawn in 16.4 million views to Trump\'s 8.1 million.\n\nWith this huge social activity, it\'s tempting to think voters are more engaged  and thus less likely to vote in November.\n\nNot necessarily.Robert Hernandez, an associate professor at the University of Southern California cautions that Twitter \"does not necessarily equate or reflect the U.S. electorate, orthe general public.\"\n\nA closer look at the candidates on social media:\n\nTwitter: Trump, who started the campaign with 4 million followers, now has over 10.6million, while Clinton, who began with about 1 million, now has 8.1 million. Trump has posted 32,800 tweets; Clinton has just 7,260tweets to her name.\n\nTrump types out opinions (Obama will go down as the worst president ever) and re-tweets articles that he agrees with, some frompublications like the Washington Post orDaily Mail, and other timesfrom extreme right-wing publications that have included white supremacist organizations.\n\nHe retweets comments from actor James Woods and conservative commentator Ann Coulter. His retweets aresometimes a source of controversy.Trump, who usuallyrefers to the democratic candidate as \"Crooked Hillary,\" deleted a tweet after some complained about the use of a Jewish star in the image, calling it anti-semitic, and noting the same image was used on a neo-Nazi message board.\n\nHistweets also directs folks to rallies and posts videos and photos from the events.\n\nNo one has ever beaten or come close to Trump when it comes to Twitter, Cornfield says.\n\nClinton uses her @hillaryclintonhandle topostpictures from rallies, retweetnegative Trump coverage from CNN and CNBC, retweet critical stuff about Trump (including a recent blastfromOhio governor John Kasich), photos and videos from her rallies and bus trip across the mid-west, and quotes from the candidate, which appear to be pulled from her stump speech.\n\nTo his constant blasts, Clinton often doesn\'t respond, but has urged him to \"Delete your account,\" Twitter speak for \"Shut up.\"\n\nClinton has taken some ground by more often using visuals with her tweets, however. Cornfield notes Clintongot more retweets of her messageduring the Democratic convention than the Republicans did, by using tweets with images and videos from the event. He published his findings on Medium.\n\nOffering the personal touch has clearly helped Trump greatly grow his audience. But what works for one candidate may not work for another.\n\nStream of consciousness tweets appeal to a different type of voter, the Trump voter, says DeMeers of Audience Bloom. Shes taking a calculated risk to not go there.\n\nTrump is more visual here than on Twitter, with graphics that support his views, short videos talking directly to the camera, complete texts of press releases, photos from rallies and the occasional rant. CNN will soon be the least trusted name in news if they continue to be the press shop for Hillary Clinton! said one post.\n\nClintons Facebook re-runs quotes (with photos) from convention and rally speeches, re-postings of Trump gaffes from ABC News and others, behind the scenes photos and campaign ads.\n\nIn this presidential cycle, its all about Twitter, despite Facebook having a much larger audience (1.6 billion to just over 300 million for Twitter.)\n\nBecause the Facebook algorithm only reaches a portion of the audience at any given time (mainly friends or followers), Twitter is seen as the way to reach the press, influencers and policy makers, since its a public forum that doesnt require registration to read, saysAlan Rosenblatt, a senior vice-president of political communications firm Turner4D.\n\nYouTube:  Clinton\'s YouTube channel has 16 million views and 64,000 subscribers, to Trump\'s 8 million and 45,000 subscribers.\n\nClinton offers 179 videos here, everything from president Barack Obama endorsing her, tributes to Clintons mom and being a grandmotherand a Quick Question series with soft, human interest Q&As on topics like best advice from her mother and what it was like moving her daughter to the college dorm.\n\nShe also showcases clips from the convention, (the same ones seen on Facebook) and campaign speech highlights. The most viewed video is the 2 minute Im running, video she used to announce the campaign, with nearly 5 million views.\n\nTrumps most viewed video is a short excerpt from himintroducing vice-presidential running mate Mike Pence at a press conference, with just over 2 million views. The 43 videos in total feature campaign ads, Trump talking directly to the camera about issues, complete speeches from rallies and short attack ads against Clinton.\n\nClinton has a stronger following on YouTubebecause she posts more often, says Turner4D\'s Rosenblatt. And with more campaign cash at her disposal and a larger staff, she has the resources to produce more slick videos, which can be shared to Facebook, Instagram and other outlets.\n\nInstagram: The candidates--2.2 million for Trump vs. 1.8 million for Clinton, use this platform to post photos and videos, the same ones that have been seen on Facebook, Twitter and YouTube. The difference is they are in the square format of Instagram, and often have text graphics as well. Instagram, which has 500 million daily users, is seen as a play for the youth votefor the candidates.\n\nSnapchat: Clinton has used Snapchat a bit, with the geofilter feature that lets people in a specific area create augmented reality frames for a limited amount of time. Snapchat\'s audience tends to be young, and very tech savvy.\n\nLinkedInClinton hasnearly 500,000 followers, while Trump doesn\'t appear to have an official presence.On LinkedIn Clinton posts articles about such topics as infrastructure and equal pay for women, first seen on her website, as well asher resume.\n\nMeanwhile, with more than 3 months to go until the fall election, Larry Sabato, the founder of the University of Virginia\'s Center for Politics,cautions to keep it all in perspective\"\n\nYes, the candidates have a large social following, but farmore people voted in the primaries, some 28 million (13 million for Trump, 15 million for Clinton) and even more,135 million, people traditionally vote in the fall election, he notes.\n\nFollow USA TODAY tech columnist and #TalkingTech host on Twitter, @jeffersongraham and listen to the daily podcast on Stitcher and iTunes.','2017-03-25 03:51:13'),(425,56,'5d66926bdc9fbc01541f969327cc25e69e6217bdb10c29b8d8f8dbd5283ed1fd','564a19080bb34604839ea7342e55c8c2','','','Thanks for your input.

They figured that paying $95 as a penalty for failing to obtain and maintain coverage would be far less expensive than the premium for any policy they could obtain. Many people experienced sticker shock when they realized how large their penalties would be.\n\nThats because the penalty for 2014 wasnt $95. The actual penalty was $95 for each adult age 18 or over plus $47.50 for each child under 18, with a maximum penalty of $285  or 1% of the total household income above the threshold for filing federal tax returns, whichever was larger. The maximum penalty for all households was capped at the national annual cost of an individual bronze tier insurance plan in 2014, which was $2,448, regardless of income and household size.\n\nFor example, the penalty for a single taxpayer who earned $45,000 in 2014 and remained uninsured for the entire year would be $348.50. Thats the result of subtracting the minimum income for being required to file a federal income tax return ($10,150 in 2014) from $45,000, for a result of $34,850, and then multiplying that figure by 1%. Ouch.\n\nIndividual mandate penalties for 2015 are even higher, increasing to $325 per adult plus $162.50 per child, for a maximum of $975  or 2% of household income, whichever is larger. As in 2014, the maximum penalty for all households has been capped at the 2015 national annual cost of an individual bronze tier plan.\n\nRemaining uninsured in 2016 will take an even bigger financial bite out of taxpayers pocketbooks. The penalty has been set for a hefty $695 per adult and $347.50 per child, with a maximum per household of $2,085 dollars. As an alternative, the penalty will be 2.5% of household income, with a maximum of the average annual premium of an individual Bronze tier health insurance plan sold through the marketplace. Taxpayers will pay whichever calculation results in the higher penalty.\n\nTaxpayers hoping to avoid the individual mandate penalty by obtaining health insurance coverage late in the year will most likely only be able to reduce the penalty rather than eliminate it. However, there are a number of exemptions based on personal circumstances and financial hardships that allow some taxpayers to avoid the penalty. To claim total or partial exemptions, taxpayers must file an application with Healthcare.gov. Taxpayers whose applications are approved receive an Electronic Confirmation Number (ECN) to claim the exemption on their federal income tax returns.\n\nThe list below represents an overview of personal exemptions to the individual mandate penalty. A full list of exemptions is available at Healthcare.gov. : Lowest-price Marketplace plans exceed 9.5% of adjusted gross income, or employer-provided healthcare plans exceed 8% of AGI.\n\nFor most hardship exemptions, taxpayers must file supporting documentation; others are automatic. Some taxpayers who qualify for hardship exemptions may be allowed to purchase catastrophic health insurance policies; others may qualify for a special enrollment period outside of open enrollment. The list below briefly describes hardship exemptions along with required documentation. A complete description of hardship exemptions and relevant forms are available through Healthcare.gov.\n\nThe best way to avoid the individual mandate penalty is to obtain health insurance coverage  either through the Marketplace, an employer or another health insurance plan that meets the minimum guidelines for the ACA. Many taxpayers who obtain insurance through the Marketplace are eligible for tax subsidies that significantly reduce premium payments or provide refundable tax credits. Other taxpayers will qualify for an additional cost-sharing subsidy that can be applied to Silver tier plans to lower the overall cost of deductibles, copays and coinsurance.\n\nIndividuals who have questions about their eligibility for tax credits, the individual mandate or any penalties they might owe can obtain assistance through Healthcare.gov. Specially trained Navigators can also assist individuals one-on-one, either in person or over the phone, with selecting appropriate coverage. Taxpayers facing large individual mandate penalties should consult with an accountant or with an attorney specializing in tax law.','2017-03-25 03:51:13'),(431,57,'65e6a39103a9e360e8c43255e07692a0a9e4ff1a6456f35ffc6c64a59234c13a','b79cdcd88aff45ac8005551109786180','','','While Bill Murray has certainly said some hilarious things over the years, suggesting taxes be taught to children using ice cream is not one of them.

Examples cited as Euromyths include stories about rules banning mince-pies, curved bananas and mushy peas.[1] Others include a story that English fish and chips shops would be forced to use Latin names for their fish (Sun, 5 September 2001),[8] quoted in [9] that double-decker buses would be banned (The Times, 9 April 1998),[10] that British rhubarb must be straight,[11] and that barmaids would have to cover up their cleavage.[12]\n\nIn some cases Euromyth stories have been traced to deliberate attempts by lobbyists to influence actions by the European bureaucracy, for instance the reintroduction of customs duties within the EU.[13][14] EU officials have also claimed that many such stories result from unclear or misunderstood information on complicated policies,[15] and are claimed to have seized on minor errors in stories as evidence that they are entirely fictional.[16]\n\nThe alleged ban on curved bananas is a long-standing, famous, and stereotypical claim[17][18][19][20] that is used in headlines to typify the Euromyth.[21][22] Amongst other issues of acceptable quality and standards, the regulation does actually specify minimum dimensions. It also states that bananas shall be free from deformation or abnormal curvature. However, the provisions relating to shape apply fully only to bananas sold as Extra class; some defects of shape (but not size) are permitted in Class I and Class II bananas.\n\nOn 29 July 2008, the European Commission held a preliminary vote towards repealing certain regulations relating to other fruit and vegetables (but not bananas). According to the Commission\'s press release, \"In this era of high prices and growing demand, it makes no sense to throw these products away or destroy them [...] It shouldn\'t be the EU\'s job to regulate these things.

In contrast, Lady Finger bananas sit at almost a straight 90-degree angle to the plants on which they grow. This results in the bananas in the bunch growing differently. The bananas on the top of the bunch grow straight up, while the bananas on the bottom of the bunch grow by twisting around.

Instead of continuing to grow towards the ground, they start to turn towards the sun. The fruit grows against gravity, giving the banana its familiar curved shape.\n\nBut why? The answer lies in the botanical history of the banana. It originated in the middle layer of the rainforest, where there is little sunlight.

Even before the announcement, Prabowo had alleged widespread electoral fraud and vowed to contest the result.\n\nPrabowo has three days to take his challenge to the constitutional court, the only Indonesian body with the authority to order a recount and overturn the results. However, with the final tally revealing a gap of eight million votes between the two candidates a recount is highly unlikely.\n\nJokowi\'s meteoric rise represents the maturing of this nation of 240 million people as a democracy. As Jokowi himself said, his dream of becoming president would have been unthinkable under the authoritarian leadership of former President Suharto.\n\nSheer personal determination aside, Jokowi\'s path to the top was cleared by Indonesia\'s decentralisation of power after street protests ousted Suharto in 1998. The devolution of power from Jakarta to the provinces forced local officials to become more accountable to the populace. It also boosted local involvement in politics. Equally important was the dissipating of the traditional notion that wahyu, or divine revelation, reverted from Jakarta and Java. Jokowi emerged out of this new political matrix.\n\nHis value-driven style of leadership is crafted from the democratic fundamental of serving the people. Jokowi\'s political morality also derives from Pancasila, Indonesia\'s official ideals, founded by the country\'s first President Sukarno. Among Pancasila\'s five principles is one calling for social justice for all Indonesians.\n\nAs the wildly popular two-term mayor of Surakarta, Jokowi transformed the city\'s management by cutting red tape, improving health services and nurturing more responsive public officials. Wearing his trademark simple white shirt, he personally solicited the views of street sweepers and stallholders in how their city should be run. Before he burst onto the scene, Indonesia had never seen the like. This street-style democracy gave Jokowi a solid platform for launching what would turn out to be a stunning rise to prominence.\n\nJokowi\'s common man approach has electrified Indonesia, ripping apart business-as-usual politics, where resources go to entrenched elites and other vested interests. A member of a prominent Javanese family and formerly married to Suharto\'s daughter, Prabowo, hails from this class. He also campaigned under a cloud of accusations of human rights abuses committed when he was a Suharto-era military general.\n\nPrabowo\'s resounding rejection of the results and the counter-rejection by the Election Commission nevertheless point to a new political landscape. Democracy is still only 16 years old in Indonesia. As it takes root, institutional tools such as election bodies and constitutional courts gain in stature and provide necessary alternative centres of power to reinforce the rule of law and contain political excesses.\n\nThe media in all its forms counts as another centre of power.\n\nOn July 4, just five days before the election, the influential Jakarta Post publication took the bold step of backing Jokowi- the first time in its 31-year history the newspaper had endorsed a candidate, \"There is no such thing as being neutral when the stakes are so high.While endeavouring as best we can to remain objective in our news reporting, our journalism has always stood on the belief of the right moral ground when grave choices must be made,\" its statement read.\n\nEarlier in the campaign, Hary Tanoesoedibjo, a billionaire tycoon who owns several TV and radio stations and newspapers, pledged support for Prabowo and running mate Hatta Rajasa.This is how a healthy media in vibrant democracies function. For a few weeks every few years, media outlets put aside their usual quest for objective journalism to rally the public to vote for a particular candidate.\n\nIndonesian social media also exploded with politically charged comment. According to the Asia Foundation more than 70 million Indonesians are using the internet and around 90 percent of these are on Facebook. More than 30 million tweet. Data gathered by the Qatar Computing Research Institute, from 21,000 followers in each camp, threw up fascinating alignments. Jokowi followers were more likely to follow US President Barack Obama - Jokowi\'s rise from obscurity has often drawn comparisons with Obama\'s political ascent. Prabowo\'s Twitter fans regularly referred to \"Islam\", or \"Muslim\", indicating his more traditional power base and well-publicised religious credentials.\n\nIn the last few weeks of the campaign, Jokowi\'s double-digit lead over Prabowo shrank after smear tactics. PoliticaWave, a company studying Indonesian social media, showed how most of the attacks targeted Jokowi. Online accusations suggesting that Jokowi was an ethnic Chinese and a former Christian inflamed anti-Chinese feelingin predominantly Muslim Indonesia.\n\nIn the hours before the July 22 announcement,tension on the streets was palpable, amid fears of violence between rival supporters. More than 250,000 police officerswere on duty across Indonesia and thousands of others surrounded the election commission building. The declaration of results sent a wave of relief around the country and abroad.\n\nAdults from the age of twenty and upwards will remember the protests that brought down Suharto in 1998 and the accompanying violence in East Timor that eventually led to the province\'s independence from Indonesia. While Prabowo\'s supporters favoured his strongman style, few in the country would agitate for a return to the old days of unrest.\n\nWhat\'s good for Indonesia is also good for the Asia-Pacific region. India, the world\'s largest democracy, carried out successful parliamentary elections in April and May, peacefully placing Narendra Modi in power as prime minister. Indonesians were keen to show their democracy was, at least, as capable.\n\nWith Philippines, another example of a democracy kicking off the vestiges of its authoritarian past, Thailand is now the only country in the region gripped by old-fashioned political turmoil, where military rulers have overthrown incumbents.\n\nStability in Indonesia will allow it to press on with its economic progress. Indonesia\'s strong economic growth of around five percent will continue, according to the Asian Development Bank. It\'s the world\'s 16th-largest economy and the strongest in the Association of Southeast Asian nations, the regional power bloc.\n\nHowever, Jokowi\'s clear vote margin also means the pressure is on him and his Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (PDI-P) to deliver. He\'ll need to be organised, focused and hard-headed if he wants to execute his Pancasila vision of social justice for all.\n\nArresting poverty will be a key challenge. The ugly truth is Indonesia\'s needs are great. Around 30 million people, out of 240 million, barely survive on $1.25 a day. Inequality is steadily rising, with a new super elite enjoying the fruits of this new growth. Prosperity is not being shared as it should be.\n\nJokowi will have to tackle fuel subsidies, which eat up a fifth of the annual budget, and undertake tricky reforms to lure in investment. He\'ll also have to improve the country\'s appalling infrastructure. He has promised 2000km of roads and 10 new seaports, badly needed to stitch this sprawling archipelago together. It won\'t be an easy ride.\n\nMoreover, at every step, the messy coalition politics that dominates Indonesia\'s political theatre could cripple Jokowi\'s abilities to achieve the transformation Indonesia needs. If Prabowo manages to persuade his seven-party coalition to stick together, before Jokowi takes office in October, this could leave Jokowi leading a minority government. This would undermine the president\'s abilities to govern and effect reform.\n\nIndonesia\'s short history of democracy is at a critical juncture. The stakes may have been high in the campaign, but they\'re even higher now. Indonesia must make sure that Jokowi\'s victory is indeed a victory for all.\n\nZarina Banu is a freelance writer, focusing on economics and business-policy in the Asia-Pacific.','2017-03-25 03:51:13'),(439,59,'66387e8b91fad9fd9751632df7d720ebb2644d76a5c8544c9d333c6cf1dd3c35','15617626ccc24548877e0de957338807','','','President Joko Jokowi Widodo knows very well the power of social media.

Social media also gives governments headaches. This is what I heard from prime ministers and presidents I met, he said.\n\nThere is news that brings commotion, Jokowi added.

We need determined and tough law enforcement.\n\nJokowi then announced plans to set up a National Cyber Agency that would combat fake news while securing the internet from potential hacking.\n\nThis move came after the Ministry of Communications and Information Technology in November blocked 11 websites in Indonesia over concerns that they contained hate speech, radical content or provoked sectarian sentiments.\n\nLast month, a group calling itself the Indonesian Community of Anti-Slander Research was established to challenge hoaxes disseminated over the internet.\n\nFake news threatens mainstream media because it spreads hatred, Yosep Stanley Adi Prasetyo, the head of Indonesias Press Council, an independent body established to protect press freedom, told BenarNews.\n\nPeople have a hard time distinguishing which is real news and which is a hoax because lots of news is produced by sites claiming to be professional news websites, Stanley said.\n\nThe values of the noble profession of journalists must be returned to the journalists who have the competence and have committed themselves to the code of ethics of the profession, he added.\n\nAnticipating the rise of fake news, the council plans to join with other journalism organizations to form an anti-hoax institution.\n\nIn addition, the council continues to certify the credentials of news organizations, having issued a barcode to 77 organizations that meet the ethics code.\n\nThis is just the kick off. The press council will continue the verification process in the next two year, he explained.\n\nThe Alliance of Independent Journalists (AJI) noted that many organizations have not passed the verification process but meet ethical standards.\n\nIn our opinion, [the certification program] received mixed reactions, mostly negative. This is because of the lack of socialization in the press community, AJI chairman Suwarjono said in a statement.\n\nAmong those who have allegedly been targeted by fake content is Basuki Ahok Tjahaja Purnama, the governor for Jakarta who is running for election on Feb. 15 but who is on trial over a blasphemy charge for a speech he made on the campaign trail in September.\n\nIn the speech, he quoted a verse from the Quran that was seen as insulting Islam. A video clip of the speech that was disseminated online went viral on social media and angered Muslims, but, in his testimony, Ahok claimed that the clip was edited in a way that distorted his words.\n\nAhok has said he never intended to offend Muslims when he cited the Surah Al-Maida Verse 51 from the Quran. Some interpret the passage as barring Muslims from having non-Muslim leaders.\n\nSince the story broke, conservative Muslims held three massive demonstrations demanding Ahok be jailed for allegedly demeaning the Quran.\n\nStories also targeted Ahoks ethnicity as a member of Indonesias Chinese minority. Reports included rumors that 10 million Chinese workers are coming to Indonesia or that a military leader has said communist China has started to meddle in Indonesia, a comment the general denies making.','2017-03-25 03:51:13'),(441,59,'66387e8b91fad9fd9751632df7d720ebb2644d76a5c8544c9d333c6cf1dd3c35','68cb2725df364bcf8ca8c9433ef74dd2','','','Fake news dominates Indonesias social media channels, prompting the government to step up measures to stop the misinformation that has already had dire effects on the countrys political landscape.\n\nIndonesias President Joko Jokowi Widodo has had enough of fake news. He wants to tackle the issue head-on and has called on his cabinet to be ready to crackdown on the spread of misinformation. We need determined and tough law enforcement, the young leader says.\n\nThis declaration came on the heels of heightened tensions with China and violent street protests against Jakartas governor Ahok, all thanks to widely-shared online articles with untrue or exaggerated claims. In fact, the problem is so severe that the Communications Ministry hasblocked 11 Islamic websites deemed to have spread ethnic, religious and racial tensions. They also arranged a meeting with representatives from Facebook to discuss inaccurate reporting on the highly-popular social media platform.\n\nIt is an important issue for Jokowi to address, Indonesia has one of the largest populations of active social media users, with an estimated 129 million people maintaining accounts. In such a vast and proactive community, information, or misinformation, spreads exceedingly fast.\n\nAlthough most of the posts aresatirical in nature, recent events reveal the circulation of content of a more malicious intent. To give one insightful example, Twitter user BoengParno caused widespread paranoia amongst Indonesians after sending a single tweet about the arrest of four Chinese nationals for planting imported chilli seeds supposedly contaminated with bacteria.\n\nThe tweet read, Havent people realised that Chinese attacks on this country are real in many ways. From drugs, illegal workers, now chilli bacteria. The allegation spread like wildfire and saw many citizens throw away their seeds and crops. The Chinese Embassy eventually had to issue a statement saying that the paranoia was, very worrying.\n\nHowever, the most visible impact of fake news on Indonesian society is in the ongoing trial of Jakartas governor over accusations of blasphemyfuelled by allegedly-doctored YouTube content. As an ethnic Chinese Christian, some of the posts in question have sought to heighten community tensions about him, highlighting the growing hard-line Islamist movement in the country and the power of social media to undermine social stability.\n\nThe problem here is the divided Indonesian community. Extremist groups make use of easily spread false news to prey on the anger of some Indonesians against the Chinese minority.These actions further entrench splits between Muslims and minority groups, a situation that religious groups themselves are trying to combat. Meanwhile, Jokowi also recognises this danger and is attempting to curb these hoaxes with his new National Cyber Agency (NCA).\n\nHis idea is an umbrella agency for existing government services that will merge with the National Encryption Agency to secure cyber activities. As such it will form a coordinating body for the cyber divisions of the Indonesian military, National Police and State Intelligence Agency, and focus onhandling material shared via social media and public websites. The details are still unclear about how exactly it will work to establish regulations and set policy for online communications, but the police force will play a role. This seems like a wide pool of powers, but the government says it will not look into any private information. Campaigners, however, are worried about an erosion of civil liberties.\n\nThe perceived threat towards freedom of speech is not unfounded. The Communications and Information Ministry has already blocked more than 800,000 websites,includingNetflix, Vimeo, Reddit and Imgur. And we may see more of this in the future, alongside collaboration with fact-checking sites, apps and Facebook pagesto surgically remove dubious posts and material. In Germany, for example,Facebook has a fact-check button that users can click on to flag articles that they think are misleading. An independent organisation then verifies these items and tags dubious materials as disputed.\n\nFalse news is a global problem, but Indonesia needs a local solution\n\nFake and biased reporting is not uniqueto Indonesia. This issue exists in almost every nation. And the basis is as much about culture as it is technology. People today share content that resonates with them without checking. In fact, based on findings in a recent BuzzFeed article, fake election stories attracted more attention than genuine ones from reputable sources. But does this mean that governments should police this material when users will not?\n\nIt is clearly in the public interest to take national action, but the options available to leaders like Jokowi are largely untested. This means he now has to quickly find a way to define the conversation, without letting it define him, as protests and consequences escalate. The development of a national agency is an innovative step, but getting the balance of civil liberties wrong could be just as dangerous for his levels of popular support as the fake news itself. Whatever he does will be too late to make an impact on the divisive gubernatorial elections, and the fate of his friend Ahok. The Governors public trial by Facebook continues. It will likely not be the last.','2017-03-25 03:51:13'),(442,59,'66387e8b91fad9fd9751632df7d720ebb2644d76a5c8544c9d333c6cf1dd3c35','abd162d9e01847b6a6b4fe6c54a069b3','','','Indonesian clerics are preparing to issue a fatwa against fake news after a series of damaging hoaxes on social media which targeted the Chinese and Christian minorities.\n\nThe move follows growing concern in the worlds most populous Muslim nation about the spread of fake news  a phenomenon that has been credited with fuelling recent ethnic and political tensions.\n\nSome of the spurious items in recent months include a claim that China was using contaminated chilli seeds to wage biological warfare against Indonesia, a claim that the design of new monetary notes contains an image of the communist hammer and sickle, and a claim that Indonesia has been inundated by ten million Chinese migrant workers (the government says the number was actually 21,000).\n\nJoko Widodo, the Indonesian president and the subject of numerous viral hoaxes, responded to the latter claim by stating: Ten million is the number of Chinese tourists we hope will come.\"\n\nThe fake news campaigns have led to public protests and have now prompted the Indonesian Ulema Council to propose a fatwa which would decree that spreading slander and lies is haram, or forbidden.\n\nMa\'ruf Amin, the councils chairman, said he wanted to co-operate on the fatwa with the government and had discussed it with the minister of communication and education.\n\n\"We asked what the government wanted and we provided [religious] guidance so that our approach will not be in opposition to government policy, he told Fairfax Media.\n\nThe spread of fake news comes amid increasing tensions ahead of next months gubernatorial election in Jakarta, the capital.','2017-03-25 03:51:13'),(443,59,'66387e8b91fad9fd9751632df7d720ebb2644d76a5c8544c9d333c6cf1dd3c35','a69ab18abea745538407ebb501982688','','','His image was steadily burnished by the media. In an interview with Australias \"Inside Story,\" Jokowi said, We go to the poor people, to the riverbank for example, and this is sexy for the media. If you interview in the office or shoot television footage in the office it is not sexy. Television is the primary way that Indonesians get their news, and Jokowi skillfully made himself into a TV star.\n\nIn Indonesia, there is one city where emerging stars go to prove themselves. Jakarta, Indonesias capital, is the countrys commercial, cultural, and political center. It has 10 million people, is one of the worlds most polluted cities, and is ringed by slums. It is the worlds largest city without a metro system, and suffers from major congestion. When Jokowi ended his second term as mayor of Solo early, in order to represent his party, PDI-P, in Jakartas 2012 gubernatorial elections, many were skeptical that his blusukan style of politicsof visiting people and collectively finding solutions for their problemswould work in a city 20 times the size of Solo.\n\nAnd though he won his election handily, Jokowi was an odd fit for Jakarta. The Jakarta political elite tend to come from august Indonesian political families; Jokowis dad, by contrast, was in the furniture business. The local media called him a Ndesoa Javanese redneckand he still maintains his deep central Javanese accent. There was something of Mr. Smith goes to Washington in Jokowis attempt to tame Jakarta. He stuck with the same approach he had perfected in Solo, visiting government offices early in the morning to check that local bureaucrats were doing their job, and consulting with slum dwellers he wanted to move from flood-prone areas. Jokowis legend continued to grow. Though he has served as governor for only a year and a half, his style of politics was effective in Jakarta. He cleared congested areas and moved slum dwellers on the riverbanks to permanent housing elsewhere, allowing him to widen canals and lessen flooding. He has developed public transit for Jakarta. Evans said, The MRT [Mass Rapid Transit], the ideas been around for 25 years, my god, now its happening. Well that didnt happen under anyone else. The thing that sustains his popularity is that he actually delivers. \n\nIn 2013, pollsters began including Jokowi on the list of potential presidential candidates. In late 2013, surveys recorded him with as much as 40 percent of the vote, with no other potential candidate approaching half that. Megawati Sukarnoputri, Indonesias first female president, was the chair of PDI-P. Though unpopular, she was believed to covet the partys nomination for president herself. She delayed her decision about whether to select Jokowi until just before the April legislative elections. Finally, she brought Jokowi to visit the grave of her father, SukarnoIndonesias first presidentand announced that Jokowi would represent the PDI-P in the presidential elections. There was little question, at the time, that Jokowi would win.\n\nThe first shock came during the legislative elections in April. How PDI-P fared would be an early test of the power of the Jokowi Effect. Polls had shown PDI-P gaining over 30 percent of seats in the legislature if Jokowi was selected as the partys presidential candidate. Instead, PDI-P won only 19 percent. Though the party became the largest party in Parliament, the vote was a major disappointment. Jokowi wasnt on the ballot, but he had asked his supporters for a landslide legislative election, and had very little to show for it. Yohanes Sulaiman, a lecturer at the Indonesian National Defense University, wrote in a blog post at the time that Jokowis aura of invincibility is broken.\n\nThe disappointing results only increased the tension between Jokowi and Megawati. Megawati was worried that Jokowi was using the PDI-P institution as a vehicle for his personal political ambitions, and that she and her family were being sidelined. According to M. Taufiqurrahman, the national editor of the Jakarta Post, she responded by trying to have her daughter placed as Jokowis VP, a suggestion that Jokowi rejected.\n\nMegawati is not a person to accept political marginalization quietly. She publicly lectured Jokowi, I made you a presidential candidate. But you should remember that you are a party official, with a function of implementing the partys programs and ideology. Prabowos campaign naturally seized on this and similar comments, and has repeatedly accused Jokowi of being \"controlled\" politically. Prabowo plays off of Jokowis rustic image to argue to voters that as hardworking and well-meaning as Jokowi may be, he is ultimately Megawatis puppet.\n\nThe campaigns inefficiencies have made it difficult to respond to Obor Rakyat, a splashy, well-funded tabloid that purports to provide evidence that Jokowi is a Christian of Chinese descent. Jokowi is a Javanese Muslim, but the charges stick because he is proudly pluralist and many of his most prominent supporters are Chinese or Christian. The paper is most widely circulated in East Java, a key battleground area that Prabowo will probably need to take in order to win the election. Jokowis campaign has, by all accounts, responded sluggishly to the charges. Weeks after the allegations started appearing, Jokowi released his birth certificate, showing that he was born Muslim, in Indonesia. The Birther controversy has not died, in part because Jokowi and his campaign proxies respond to the charges with great restraint. Puan Maharani, Megawatis daughter, and a PDI-P representative, said of the charges, Jokowis racial and religious backgrounds are clear. He is Javanese and a Muslim. However, if he was not, so what? Its not clear that this was an effective response. Adityo told me that many of his friendsincluding highly educated ones who studied abroadcontinue to quote from second-rate news sources in support of the allegations about Jokowi being Chinese and Christian.\n\nTaufiqurrahman, of the Jakarta Post, sat down with me the day after the paper, for the first time in its history, released an editorial endorsing a candidateJokowifor president. He worried that the democracy he had fought for, as a student activist in 1998, would be rolled back by a Prabowo victory. He said he began to learn about the Jokowi campaigns ineffectiveness when he dispatched reporters to cover Jokowi and Prabowo campaign rallies. The reporters covering Prabowo were invariably met at the airport with air-conditioned busses and served catered meals. The reporters covering Jokowi often ended up stranded at the airport for days.\n\nTaufiqurrahman marveled at Jokowis change in fortunes. Its astounding, really. It doesn\'t make any sense. Three months ago Jokowi still had a 60 percent approval rating. Since then, Jokowis numbers have been down all the time. I asked him to tell me the word that best summed up how he was feeling, a few days before the election. I think the right word is despair, he said.\n\nThis has been an incredibly dynamic campaign. Despite the partisanship of the media, and the Black Campaign, the election has featured five televised debates, and prompted serious discussion about the qualities that Indonesians want in their next president. The election has the same extravaganza qualities as American elections, with celebrities hosting concerts in favor of their preferred candidates, and legions of caf patrons debating whether Jokowi could still win if he loses East Java, or which way North Sumatra will swing.\n\nBut there remains something dark about it. Gladys, an Indonesian of Chinese descent, was a child in 1998, when Prabowo made a speech blaming the Chinese-Indonesian community for Indonesias troubles, and Chinese-Indonesian homes in Jakarta were ransacked. She told me about how, in 1998, her mother had purchased dark foundation, so that her complexion would appear more ethnically Indonesian. Gladys wondered whether, if Prabowo won, sooner or later, she would also have to wear make-up to avoid looking too Chinese.\n\nFears about a Prabowo presidency are based on his past statements and actions, but also promises he has made during the campaign. Dave McRae, senior research fellow at the Asia Institute, University of Melbourne, worried that Prabowo would unwind Indonesias democracy. In an e-mail, McRae said Prabowo has clearly stated his opposition to the key pillars of democracy. He opposes direct elections as costly and out of step with Indonesian culture, whereas they are the main way elected officials, the president included, are held accountable by the public in Indonesia.  There is no guarantee Prabowo would be able to achieve these changes if elected, but the fact that he is saying these things openly is cause for great concern, and hasn\'t received the scrutiny it merits within Indonesia.\n\nI spoke with retired General Subagyo Hadi Siswoyo, former Army chief of staff, and chair of DKP, the military committee that recommended Prabowos dismissal from the Army for his role in the 1998 kidnapping of young democracy activists. Siswoyo said, Much of the military today may be behind Prabowo, but the generals who know how insubordinate he wasthe generals with four starsthey could never support Prabowo. He is too unpredictable.\n\nThe races tightness means there is a greater risk of electoral violence, from supporters of both candidates. Andreas Harsono, an Indonesia researcher at Human Rights Watch, told me he worried that different polls will show different vote counts and that in the next 24 hours after the election either one or two will claim to be the winner. The margin of error is going to be bigger than the difference [in vote total]. There is a two-week period between when the vote is held and the central election commission announces the winner. It could be a messy 21 days. Taufiqurrahman, the Jakarta Post editor, said, If the margin is within 2 or 3 percent, this is going to be a tinderbox for conflict.\n\nHe added, We wouldnt be worrying about any of this if Jokowi had run a better campaign.\n\nCorrection: A previous version of this article misspelledAndreas Harsono\'s last name. And it will be two weeks, not three, before the official results are announced.','2017-03-25 03:51:13'),(444,59,'66387e8b91fad9fd9751632df7d720ebb2644d76a5c8544c9d333c6cf1dd3c35','58509e95086446b88910c00c2550b4d6','','','In late November, Indonesian social-media activist Ulin Yusron found himself depicted in a meme. The image, which went viral, falsely portrayed the long-haired male journalist as Amalia Ayuningtyas  a female election volunteer for the governor of Jakarta. The photo, the text claimed, was of Amalia immodestly casting off her usual hijab. It asked: Wheres the Veil??\n\nJakarta\'s Christian and ethnically Chinese governor  Basuki Tjahaja Purnama, popularly known as Ahok  is a target for hard-line Muslims, who have successfully pressured the authorities to put him on trial for blasphemy . It is not surprising that memes are being produced that seek to depict the Muslim volunteers in his camp as irreligious and profane.\n\nWhen I first saw it, I was able to laugh, Ulin tells TIME about the photo collage. But later on, it became so troublesome because there were people who believed it  [The meme] was around for quite a while, and I became tired of explaining it.\n\nHoaxes like this, and fake news items in general, have become a massive problem in Indonesia in recent months, coinciding with the hotly contested Jakarta gubernatorial election campaign. To be sure, the sharing of fake news on social media has contributed to political tension in many countries  by one estimate, it generated more social-media engagement than real news during the U.S. presidential election in November  but in Indonesia, with its recent incidences of domestic terrorism, and its long and bloody history of anticommunist, anti-Christian and anti-Chinese pogroms, inflaming ethnic and political tensions is potentially deadly.\n\nPresident Joko Jokowi Widodo, seen as a Muslim moderate, has vowed to crack down, telling a Cabinet meeting that fake news was nothing short of an attempt to destabilize his government. Slander, hatred and rude words on social media are increasingly troubling people, Jokowi tweeted on Dec. 29. We need determined and tough law enforcement.\n\nThe problem first drew significant attention during Indonesia\'s 2014 presidential election, in which Jokowi  Ahok\'s predecessor as Jakarta\'s top official  was a candidate. During electioneering, Jokowi was the constant target of a smear campaign that falsely claimed he was, among other things, the child of Indonesian Communist Party members, of Chinese descent, and a Christian. (He was forced to make his marriage certificate public to quell the rumors.)\n\nNow, the creators of fake news are targeting Ahok, who was deputy governor of Indonesia\'s sprawling capital under Jokowi. Ahok succeeded his boss in the governorship and, backed by Jokowis party, is now seeking his own mandate in the gubernatorial election next year, competing with two other rivals, including former President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono\'s son. Ahok\'s candidacy is opposed by hard-liners who, insisting that Indonesia\'s top jobs be filled Muslims only, want to quash any chances Ahok may have of following Jokowi into the national arena.\n\nAn edited video and transcript of a campaign speech Ahok made in September, uploaded onto Facebook, went viral and led to ultra-conservative Muslims accusing him of denigrating the Quran. (Ahok suggested in the speech that hard-liners who cited a Quranic verse to support their position that non-Muslims shouldn\'t hold high office were misleading voters. His exact words were: Ladies and gentlemen, you dont have to vote for me  because youve been lied to by those using [the Qurans] Surah al-Maidah verse 51.)\n\nThree massive demonstrations resulted, bringing tens of thousands of people to the streets of Jakarta, demanding that Ahok be jailed. He was subsequently put in the dock .\n\nAhok\'s Chinese ethnicity is the target of much of Indonesia\'s false news  highly disturbing in a country where tens of thousands of Chinese have lost their lives in pogroms dating back to Dutch colonial rule. There are false rumors of 10 million mainland Chinese workers swamping Indonesia (which Jokowi has rebuffed, saying that 10 million is the number of Chinese tourists we hope will come). Others claim that the design of Indonesias new monetary notes resembles Chinese currency  or that Ahoks free HPV vaccine program could make girls infertile, and is, therefore, part of a Chinese conspiracy to diminish the Indonesian population. Hoaxers also claimed that the commander of the armed forces, General Gatot Nurmantyo, has warned that communist China has started to meddle in this country. Both the Indonesian military and the general have denied he ever made such a statement.\n\nAt the same time, Anti-Chinese sentiment isnt independent of its own. It is part of a larger network, says the social-media activist Ulin, who is a supporter of Ahok. He says that fake news is also whipping up anticommunist and anti-Shiite feelings. All of this is to heighten anti-Ahok sentiment while at the same time de-legitimizing Jokowi.\n\nHoax news has been a daily phenomenon in Indonesia, says Titi Anggraini, executive director of the Association for Elections and Democracy, a Jakarta-based elections watchdog that is also known as Perludem in Indonesian. But, the spread of hoax news intensified during the 2014 presidential election and is intensifying in [the run-up to] the 2017 Jakarta gubernatorial election.\n\nThe government, watchdog groups and even religious organizations have taken steps to stem its spread. The Communications Ministry on Wednesday blocked 11 websites, mostly for spreading hatred and misinformation, following a similar step in November. Fact-check sites, apps and Facebook pages, run by activists and volunteers, have sprung up to set the record straight. Nahdlatul Ulama, the biggest Islamic mass organization in Indonesia, has kicked off an anti-fake-news campaign called #TurnBackHoax, while Muhammadiyah, the second biggest Islamic organization, has declared that spreading hoax news is tantamount to a sin. The Press Council has also said it will be verifying trusted media outlets.\n\nSuch actions are important to make things right and to teach a lesson to offenders, Titi tells TIME. But, she adds, The legal process, especially criminal punishment, is really ultimum remidium [the last resort]  and calls for digital literacy education. She also wants guarantees that law enforcement will respect freedom of expression.

NYC MAYOR MICHAEL BLOOMBERG: Now, I\'m not here as a member of any party, or to endorse any party platform. I am here for one reason, and one reason only: to explain why I believe it is my imperative that we elect Hillary Clinton as the next president of the United States. And to ask you to join with me in supporting her this November.\n\n \n\n When the Founding Fathers arrived here in Philadelphia to forge a new nation, they didn\'t come as Democrats or Republicans, or to nominate a presidential candidate. They came as patriots who feared party politics. I know how they felt. I\'ve been a Democrat, I\'ve been a Republican, and I eventually became an independent because I don\'t believe either party has a monopoly on good ideas or strong leadership.\n\n \n\n When I enter the voting booth each time, I look at the candidate, not the party label. I have supported elected officials from both sides of the aisle. Probably not many people in this room can say that, but I know there are many watching at home who can. And now, they are carefully weighing their choices. I understand their dilemma.\n\n \n\n I know what it\'s like to have neither party fully represent my views or values. Too many Republicans wrongly blame immigrants for our problems, and they stand in the way of action on climate change and gun violence. Meanwhile, many Democrats wrongly blame the private sector for our problems, and they stand in the way of action on education reform and deficit reduction.\n\n \n\n There are times when I disagree with Hillary. But whatever our disagreements may be, I\'ve come here to say: We must put them aside for the good of our country. And we must united around the candidate who can defeat a dangerous demagogue.\n\n \n\n I believe it\'s the duty of all American citizens to make our voices heard by voting in this election. And, if you\'re not yet registered to vote, go online. Do it now. It\'s just too important to sit this out.\n\n \n\n Now, we\'ve heard a lot of talk in this campaign about needing a leader who understands business. I couldn\'t agree more. I\'ve built a business and I didn\'t start it with a million-dollar check from my father. Because of my success in the private sector, I had the chance to run America\'s largest city for 12 years, governing in the wake of its greatest tragedy.\n\n \n\n Today, as an independent, an entrepreneur, and a former mayor, I believe we need a president who is a problem solver, not a bomb thrower. Someone who can bring members of Congress together, to get things done. And I know Hillary Clinton can do that because I saw it firsthand.\n\n \n\n I was elected mayor two months after 9/11, as a Republican  and I saw how Hillary Clinton worked with Republicans in Washington to ensure that New York got the help it needed to recover and rebuild. Throughout her time in the Senate, we didn\'t always agree\n\n  but she always listened. And that\'s the kind of approach we need in Washington today, and it just has to start in the White House.\n\n \n\n Given my background, I\'ve often encouraged business leaders to run for office because many of them share that same pragmatic approach to building consensus, but not all. Most of us who have created a business know that we\'re only as good as the way our employees, clients, and partners view us. Most of us don\'t pretend that we\'re smart enough to make every big decision by ourselves. And most of us who have our names on the door know that we\'re only as good as our word. But not Donald Trump.\n\n \n\n Throughout his career, Trump has left behind a well-documented record of bankruptcies, thousands of lawsuits, angry shareholders, and contractors who feel cheated, and disillusioned customers who feel ripped off. Trump says he wants to run the nation like he\'s run his business. God help us.\n\n \n\n I\'m a New Yorker, and New Yorkers know a con when we see one! Trump says he\'ll punish manufacturers that move to Mexico or China, but the clothes he sells are made overseas in low-wage factories. He says he wants to put Americans back to work, but he games the US visa system so he can hire temporary foreign workers at low wages. He says he wants to deport 11 million undocumented people, but he seems to have no problem in hiring them. What\'d I miss here?!\n\n \n\n Truth be told, the richest thing about Donald Trump is his hypocrisy. He wants you to believe that we can solve our biggest problems by deporting Mexicans and shutting out Muslims. He wants you to believe that erecting trade barriers will bring back good jobs. He\'s wrong on both counts.\n\n \n\n We can only solve our biggest problems if we come together and embrace the freedoms that our Founding Fathers established right here in Philadelphia, which permitted our ancestors to create the great American exceptionalism that all of us now enjoy. Donald Trump doesn\'t understand that. Hillary Clinton does. And we can only create good jobs if we make smarter investments in infrastructure and do more to support small businesses. Not stiff them. Donald Trump doesn\'t understand that. Hillary Clinton does.\n\n \n\n I understand the appeal of a businessman president. But Trump\'s business plan is a disaster in the making. He would make it harder for small businesses to compete, do great damage to our economy, threaten the retirement savings of millions of Americans, lead to greater debt and more unemployment, erode our influence in the world, and make our communities less safe.\n\n \n\n The bottom line is: Trump is a risky, reckless, and radical choice. And we can\'t afford to make that choice.\n\n \n\n Now, I know Hillary Clinton is not flawless; no candidate is. But she is the right choice  and the responsible choice  in this election. No matter what you may think about her politics or her record, Hillary Clinton understands that this is not reality television; this is reality. She understands the job of president. It involves finding solutions, not pointing fingers, and offering hope, not stoking fear.\n\n \n\n Over the course of our country\'s proud history, we have faced our share of grave challenges, but we have never retreated in fear. Never. Not here in Philadelphia in 1996, not at Gettysburg in 1863, not through two World Wars and a Great Depression, not at Selma or Stonewall, and not after 9/11  and we must not start now.\n\n \n\n America is the greatest country on Earth  and when people vote with their feet, they come here. The presidency of the United States is the most powerful office in the world, and so I say to my fellow independents: Your vote matters now. Your vote will determine the future of your job, your business, and our future together as a country.\n\n \n\n To me, this election is not a choice between a Democrat and a Republican. It\'s a choice about who is better to lead our country right now: better for our economy, better for our security, better for our freedom, and better for our future.\n\n \n\n There is no doubt in my mind that Hillary Clinton is the right choice this November. So tonight, as an independent, I am asking you to join with me  not out of party loyalty but out of love of country. And together, let\'s elect Hillary Clinton as the next president of the greatest country in the world, the United States of America.\n\n \n\n Let\'s elect a sane, competent person.','2017-03-25 03:51:13'),(454,61,'6b4dfe0bb0d6f99321a2006242c5e1365e8c0986c87269b34e4c897042c4ba4b','90a82cabb42f456d8311005adf58f304','','','Michael Bloomberg, the self-made billionaire and former Republican mayor of New York City, on Wednesday night told the Democratic National Convention that Hillary Clinton must be elected for the good of the country.\n\nBloomberg, now an independent, said that he is not endorsing the Democratic Party platform, going so far as to say that Democrats too often blame the private sector for economic troubles, and are obstructionists on issues of education reform and deficit reduction.\n\nBut he also said that he believes Trump is a \"dangerous demagogue\" who must be defeated, and that not all business experience is created equal.\n\n\"Most of us who have created a business know that we\'re only as good as the way our employees, clients and partners view us,\" Bloomberg explained. \"Most of us don\'t pretend we\'re smart enough to make every big decision by ourselves.

He was hit by two bombshells he made himself.\n\nHe has zero experience in political office. He claims, however, to be qualified for the presidency because he is a business genius. I was told by a Republican neighbor that hell run the nation like a business and shake things up in D.C.\n\nYes! Sir Lancelot Trump, our legendary knight in shining armor, will fire the lobbyists and rewrite the Constitution to help the little guy. Sadly, this legend is closer to Monty Python and the Holy Grail than reality. His pythons grip is well-chronicled.\n\nBillionaire Michael Bloomberg said, I have known Trump for decades. We have traveled in the same business circles. He is known among other millionaires as a con artist and among business owners as a cheat out to stiff everyone.\n\nRepublican mouthpiece Kellyanne Conway said, Donald Trump says hes for the little guy but hes actually built a lot of his businesses on the backs of the little guy and has a history of not paying contractors after theyve built something for him (CNN, 2/10/16). (She is now his campaign manager. Dont vomit.)\n\nRegardless, millions fell for his swaggering on The Apprentice. As a reminder, this was pure fiction. His claims to immense wealth are trumped up and one of the reasons he refused to release his tax returns. Then Bombshell No. 1 blew up.\n\nSome of his tax returns were leaked to the press. Our genius lost $916 million in 1995. This staggering loss was (a) in casinos where the odds favor the house; (b) during President Clintons economic boom years; (c) even after defrauding 4,000 contractors, and (d) self-inflicted.\n\nDemographics are the foundation of every real estate project just as much as the concrete. Atlantic City might have accommodated one overpriced gambling joint. Trump gave it three more, all cutting their own throats. He ignored the demographics. These are numbers indicating how many wallets would probably show up. If not enough show up, any project is doomed. His projects ended up in bankruptcy.\n\nHe showed colossal stupidity but waltzed off with enough investors money to buy a Boeing 757. He swaggers around in it to fool the yokels with his genius. Bloomberg said, Trump says he wants to run the nation like hes run his business. God help us.\n\nNot only his stupidity blew up in his face, his nonpayment of taxes did too. He bragged about it in the first debate with a smart-mouthed crack: That makes me smart. This made millions of voters smart once they realized he had called them idiots for paying their taxes. A Pew Research poll found last year that 53 percent of Americans were not concerned about their taxes. America is a low-taxed country by international standards. But 6 in 10 objected to wealthy moochers not paying their fair share.\n\nTheir avoidance of taxes is actually legal. Billionaire Warren Buffett pays taxes at a lower rate than his secretary, but at least he pays some taxes. He is a piker compared to Trump. The real estate lobby has rigged the tax code to make even bankers blush. Nation on the Take describes the utter stinking corruption that passes for Americas democracy. Expecting Trump to fix it is like putting the fox in charge of the chickens.\n\nBombshell No. 2 went off soon after, adding moral bankruptcy to financial bankruptcy. It was a video of Trump bragging he could assault women with impunity since he was a star. In the second debate he tried to brush it aside as locker room talk. I have rowed and played rugby but have never heard talk like that in locker rooms.\n\nSenior Republicans have run away in droves from this pariah. Many have even announced their intention to vote for Hillary. This turn of events has rendered obsolete my article on Trumps economic plans. Here are thumbnail sketches only.\n\nHis first tax plan would give massive breaks to the top 1 percent, adding $11 trillion to national debt. The Tax Policy Center says his second one would add $7 trillion but favors the ultra-rich even more. If you think either plan has the nations interests at heart, I have good news for you. Obamacare covers mental illness.\n\nAs for his economic policy, The Economist politely called him an idiot: Mr. Trump paints a picture of the economy that is irreconcilable with the facts. In summary, The Republican nominees ideas on the economy are thoughtless and dangerous\n\nAnd hypocritical, to boot: He gets his steel from China but says it preys on us. He defended himself, saying he was a businessman. The human weakness despised most by Christ was hypocrisy. Bloomberg nailed it: The richest thing about Trump is his hypocrisy.','2017-03-25 03:51:13'),(456,61,'6b4dfe0bb0d6f99321a2006242c5e1365e8c0986c87269b34e4c897042c4ba4b','ab1b0e0572844ad58e95d7353515f6af','','','The Super Bowl was an extraordinary game. It turned on a number of close-call decisions by referees on the field some of which were reviewed on appeal. When a ruling is appealed, the decision comes down from the booth and the game goes on. If there were no rules governing the game, there would be no game. And if there were no referees enforcing the rules, there also would be no game.\n\nThe comparison of the Super Bowl to the legal system is a simple one and by making it, I do not intend to suggest that the legal system is just a game. But, in the legal system as in football, the judges on the bench and the referees on the field are charged with enforcing the rules  sometimes in close calls. While we may not like a ruling, we respect and accept the authority of those entrusted with making it.\n\nSure we boo and hiss our opposition from the stands or directly at our televisions. And we call into sports radio debating whether the referee made the right call. However, what we do not do ever is question whether the referee or the booth had the right to rule. We understand that for the game to be played, it needs impartial arbitrators deciding the close calls.\n\nIt troubles me that President Donald Trump has done precisely that: questioned the authority of a judge to do his job and rule on a matter of law. Regardless of whether or not you think the judge got it right, and I am taking no position on that matter, my point is we must accept that the judge not only had the right, he had the responsibility to call it. For one branch of government to question the legitimacy of another is analogous to saying that teams should make their own rules and there should be no referees.\n\nThe Rule of Law is a tough concept to convey. But it is really, really important to our democracy. What it means is that as a society we accept that the law applies equally to everyone  the powerful, the powerless, rich, poor, rural, urban, whatever. The opposite of the Rule of Law is the rule of man: where one person or one group make arbitrary decisions based upon their own personal preferences and agendas without checks and balances. So, back to my football analogy: We accept that the New England Patriots are this years champions because the same rules applied to both teams and to all players equally. The Rule of Law creates predictability, equality and ultimately justice.\n\nThe second tough concept is the independence of the judiciary. Courts are an independent branch of government judges should not be politicians in black robes, beholden to a particular constituency or with an agenda. Rather, they are accountable only to the Rule of Law. Judges should enforce the law, without regard to popularity or political winds. And honoring the independence of the judiciary the checks and balances it provides is a key part of Americas constitutional structure.\n\nSo, on the one hand we seek judges who are impartial, and who understand their role in the constitutional scheme of things. And we expect procedures that are fair and even-handed. That is where the Institute for the Advancement of the American Legal Systemfocuses our energies: on choosing judges who have those characteristics and on building court procedures that work.\n\nThen we stand back and honor the system and the people who make it work: the judges. We disagree with rulings, we appeal them, but ultimately we accept them and go forward. When we attack the judges, we attack the whole system. And that, in and of itself, undermines the constitutional balance of powers and what it means to live in a free and civil society.\n\nRebecca Love Kourlis is the founder and executive director of the Institute for the Advancement of the American Legal System at the University of Denver.

In pursuit of personal advancement, I have made great deals to build my company and my net worth. Elect me president of the United States and I will place those talents and services at your disposal.\n\nTo many, its a compelling argument. Rather than another weak-kneed politician, America would have a CEO president  a titan of industry who could run a tight ship; a Gordon Gekko out to make America strong and rich again.\n\nBut how many Americans are aware of the grimy details of Trumps famously #winning record?\n\nAnd how many know that Donald J. Trumps vaunted business career is marked less by innovative, hard-charging business acumen, and more by good old-fashioned bullying? As one might expect, Trump claims to represent the interests of the blue-collar citizenry of this country. But his business record reveals a man with a penchant for persecuting the little man  or even the little old lady:\n\nTrump Asks the Government to Take Out an Atlantic City Widow\n\nIf there was ever an example of a caddish play, it was Trumps persecution of five-foot-three-inch-tall Atlantic City widow, Vera Coking.\n\nIn 1961, Coking bought a modest three-story house on Columbia Place in Atlantic City a short walk off the boardwalk. She raised her children in that house. She made a life in that house. For 25 years, Vera Coking lived in that house while Atlantic City began its transformation into a Jersey-style version of Vegas, complete with mega casinos and their billionaire owners.\n\nIn the early 80s, Penthouse magazine founder Bob Guccione offered Coking a cool million dollars for her property, which he wanted to raze to make way for a casino. She refused.\n\nUnfortunately for her, the story didnt end there. As the Washington Post reports, no sooner had Coking turned Guccione down, thanDonald Trump  in the middle of building his giant Trump Plaza casino  moved in for the kill. Trump offered to buy the property  he wanted to turn Cokings house into limousine parking  but, again, the sturdy woman refused his bid: The house wasnt for sale.\n\nAnd so, because nothing could be permitted to stand in the way of his ambition, Trump began playing hardball  with a widow.\n\nTrump was very much in favor of using the governments eminent-domain power, a power that  until the Supreme Courts scurrilous Kelo decision  was intended to (as a last resort) allow the government to forcibly acquire property from private owners for public use. By no reasonable interepretation could Trumps limousine parking lot be charactized as public use; on the contrary, it was for Trumps use and Trumps use alone. Robert VerBruggen summed up the situation well in a recent National Review piece: [Trump] has a track record of using the government as a hired thug to take other peoples property.\n\nCoking fought Trump and the development authority in court, until, eventually, the New Jersey Superior Court finally threw out the case. The court ruled that the casino and Trump were wrong, wrote the Washington Posts Manuel Roig-Franzia. The government couldnt take Cokings house and let Trump have it.\n\nCoking, according to the New York Daily News, called Trump a maggot, a cockroach, and a crumb for his behavior in the ordeal.\n\nVera Coking  still going strong  is now past 90 years old; she faced down the Donalds bullying and lived to tell the tale.\n\nTrump Ran a Scam University, Cheating Students Out of Thousands of Dollars\n\nIf there is one thing that Donald Trump knows how to sell, its his reputation as a real-estate mogul. (What else, after all, was the premise of NBCs The Apprentice?) But when little people attempted to learn from the master  to, in effect, become Trumps apprentices  he screwed them.\n\nAs National Reviews Jillian Kay Melchior has extensively reported, in 2005 Trump set up an unlicensed educational venture he christened Trump University.\n\nTrump promised to teach enrollees the secrets to his real-estate success. But, in reality, the venture was just a shakedown.\n\nThe students were told that they would be learning from hand-picked real-estate professionals. Moreover, they were pressured into paying for more expensive seminars where they were led to believe that Trump would personally impart his business secrets.\n\nInstead, after spending thousands of dollars on the seminars, some attendees were taken on tours of dilapidated Philadelphia neighborhoods.\n\nSome of the students were offered the opportunity to take pictures with Trump  or, rather, with a cardboard cut-out of the Donald.\n\nWhile Trumps people claimed that the courses were conducted in a first-class manner and that the materials were high-quality and first-rate, one attendee, Richard Hewson, wrote in an affidavit: We concluded that we had paid over $20,000 for nothing, based on our belief in Donald Trump and the promises made at the [organizations] free seminar and three-day workshop . . . The whole thing was a scam.\n\nIn October 2014, Reuters reported that a New York judge had ruled Trump personally liable for operating a for-profit investment school without the required license.\n\nTrump University reportedly earned nearly $40 million in revenue before its unceremonious shuttering  with some students paying as much as $35,000 to attend the seminars.\n\nDonald Trump may claim to mentor his apprentices on TV, but in the real world  he just screws them.\n\nTrump Used Illegal Immigrants to Build Trump Tower  and Then Cheated Them\n\nDonald Trump claims he will shut down illegal immigration  thereby protecting those low-skilled American workers whose wages and jobs are imperiled by the influx. What he doesnt tell his audiences, however, is that he has employed illegal immigrants on various projects over the years, including the construction of his empires crown jewel: Trump Tower.\n\nNearly 200 Poles  nicknamed the Polish Brigade  worked twelve-hour shifts, seven days a week with no overtime and were paid irregularly (if at all), according to the New York Times; almost two decades later many of the Polish men Trumpcheated were still trying to make him pay up.\n\nThey were undocumented and worked off the books, Manhattan federal Judge Charles Stewart said of the Polish Brigade. No records were kept, no Social Security or other taxes were withheld.\n\nDuring the trial, Trump denied knowing that illegal immigrants had been working on his property, despite the fact that members of the Polish Brigade were easily distinguishable (they didnt wear hardhats). Even more damning, many of the Poles testified that Trumps people threatened the Polish Brigade with deportation if any caused trouble.\n\nRELATED: The Art of the Deal-Breaker\n\nThe presiding judge found that Trump, his partner, and the contractor on the job, engaged in a conspiracy and that [Trump] knew the Polish workers were working off the books, that they were doing demolition work, that they were non-union, that they were paid substandard wages with no overtime pay, and that they were paid irregularly if at all; the appeals court found that if it was true that Trump and his associates did not know he was employing illegal immigrants on his job they should have known.\n\nThe case was finally settled in 1999  19 years after demolition work began and 16 years after the suit was filed.\n\nTrump, of course, now rails against illegal immigration, calling it a wrecking ball aimed at U.S. taxpayers.\n\nTrump Loves Vets  Unless They Get in His Way\n\nDonald Trump loves Americas veterans  or at least thats what he tells us  going so far as to skip the final Republican debate before the Iowa caucuses in order to run his own show and raise funds for veterans charities.\n\nBut Trumps championing of veterans may just be a campaign ploy, as his past actions have rarely matched his current rhetoric.\n\nForbess Emily Canal found that the billionaire developer donated only $57,000 to veterans organizations through his foundation between 2009 and 2013. To put that in perspective, the Trump Foundation donated nearly $5.5 million in total in that period, including between $100,001 and $250,000 to the Clinton Foundation.\n\nWorse, Trumps tight-fistedness pales in comparison to the way he treated veterans trying to earn an honest living.\n\nBeginning in the years after the Civil War, New York granted special licenses to veterans who wanted to set up street-vending stalls. As any visitor to the Big Apple can see, many veterans have taken advantage of the special licensing program. But Donald J. Trump wanted the veterans out of sight: Do we allow Fifth Ave., one of the worlds finest and most luxurious shopping districts, to be turned into an outdoor flea market, clogging and seriously downgrading the area? Trump wrote in a 1991 letter to John Dearie, the chairman of the state assemblys Committee on Cities.\n\nMichael Daly of the Daily Beast reports that Trump was still at it in 2004 when he wrote a letter to New York mayor Michael Bloomberg pleading for the end to the veteransstreet stalls.\n\nDonald Trump is all for veterans  unless they ruin his fabulous views of Trump Tower.\n\nA single incident could be explained away as a one-off, an anomaly. Two or three or four incidents? Thats a pattern. And the pattern is clear: Donald Trump bullied his way through life. To Trump, the livelihoods, property rights, or expectations of fairness of the little people didnt matter a wit in his pursuit of wealth and power.\n\nBut what evidence do we have that Trump is finished being a bully?

Bloomberg issued several remarks critical of Donald Trump during his DNC speech, including referring to his candidacy as a con and mocking his business acumen, but he did not say the words attributed to him above.\n\nA full transcript of Bloombergs speech can be found here, while the relevant portion has been reproduced below:\n\nIm a New Yorker, and New Yorkers know a con when we see one! Trump says hell punish manufacturers that move to Mexico or China, but the clothes he sells are made overseas in low-wage factories. He says he wants to put Americans back to work, but he games the US visa system so he can hire temporary foreign workers at low wages. He says he wants to deport 11 million undocumented people, but he seems to have no problem in hiring them. Whatd I miss here?! Truth be told, the richest thing about Donald Trump is his hypocrisy. He wants you to believe that we can solve our biggest problems by deporting Mexicans and shutting out Muslims. He wants you to believe that erecting trade barriers will bring back good jobs. Hes wrong on both counts. We can only solve our biggest problems if we come together and embrace the freedoms that our Founding Fathers established right here in Philadelphia, which permitted our ancestors to create the great American exceptionalism that all of us now enjoy. Donald Trump doesnt understand that. Hillary Clinton does. And we can only create good jobs if we make smarter investments in infrastructure and do more to support small businesses. Not stiff them. Donald Trump doesnt understand that. Hillary Clinton does. I understand the appeal of a businessman president. But Trumps business plan is a disaster in the making. He would make it harder for small businesses to compete, do great damage to our economy, threaten the retirement savings of millions of Americans, lead to greater debt and more unemployment, erode our influence in the world, and make our communities less safe. The bottom line is: Trump is a risky, reckless, and radical choice. And we cant afford to make that choice.\n\nNonetheless, some newspapers misquoted Bloomberg and reported that he had referred to Trump as a con artist:\n\nIt was Florida senator Marco Rubio who referred to Trump (more than once) as a con artist during the campaign for the Republican nomination:\n\nWe are so excited about what lies ahead for our campaign, Rubio said. You see, just five days ago, we began to unmask the true nature of the front-runner so far in this race. Five days ago, we began to explain to the American people that Donald Trump is a con artist. Two weeks from tonight right here in Florida we are going to send a message loud and clear, Rubio said. We are going to send the message that the party of Lincoln and Reagan and the presidency of the United States will never be held by a con artist.\n\n','2017-03-25 03:51:13'),(459,62,'7039c9016dec0fa7a6ae83e283299a14202349eccd62d7463a6f81b9727407e1','768663662e5c42999110442d87b5bb2b','','','Spongebob Squarepants is looking a lot brighter these days.

The series chronicles the adventures and endeavors of the title character and his various friends in the fictional underwater city of Bikini Bottom. The series\' popularity has made it a media franchise, as well as the highest rated series to ever air on Nickelodeon, and the most distributed property of MTV Networks. As of 2015, the media franchise has generated $12 billion in merchandising revenue for Nickelodeon.[2]\n\nMany of the ideas for the series originated in an unpublished educational comic book titled The Intertidal Zone, which Hillenburg created in 1989.[3] He began developing SpongeBob SquarePants into a television series in 1996 upon the cancellation of Rocko\'s Modern Life, and turned to Tom Kenny, who had worked with him on that series, to voice the title character. SpongeBob was originally going to be named SpongeBoy, and the series was to be called SpongeBoy Ahoy!, but these were both changed, as the name was already trademarked.\n\nNickelodeon held a preview for the series in the United States on May 1, 1999, following the television airing of the 1999 Kids\' Choice Awards. The series officially premiered on July 17, 1999. It has received worldwide critical acclaim since its premiere and gained enormous popularity by its second season. A feature film, The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie, was released in theaters on November 19, 2004, and a sequel was released on February 6, 2015. On July 21, 2012, the series was renewed and aired its ninth season, beginning with the episode \"Extreme Spots\".\n\nThe series has won a variety of awards, including six Annie Awards, eight Golden Reel Awards, two Emmy Awards, 12 Kids\' Choice Awards, and two BAFTA Children\'s Awards. Despite its widespread popularity, the series has been involved in several public controversies, including one centered on speculation over SpongeBob\'s intended sexual orientation, and another focusing on the perceived declining quality of the show\'s content since the release of the first film. In 2011, a newly described species of fungi, Spongiforma squarepantsii, was named after the cartoon\'s title character.\n\nThe series revolves around its title character and his various friends. SpongeBob SquarePants is an energetic and optimistic sea sponge (although his appearance more closely resembles a kitchen sponge) who lives in a sea pineapple and loves his job as a fry cook at the Krusty Krab. He has a pet snail, Gary, who meows like a cat. Living two houses down from SpongeBob is his best friend Patrick Star, a dim-witted yet friendly pink starfish who lives under a rock. Despite his mental setbacks, Patrick still sees himself as intelligent.[4] Squidward Tentacles is SpongeBob\'s next-door neighbor and co-worker at the Krusty Krab.[5] Squidward is an arrogant and ill-tempered octopus who lives in an Easter Island moai and dislikes his neighbors (especially SpongeBob) for their childlike behavior. He enjoys playing the clarinet and painting self-portraits, but hates his job as a cashier.\n\nAnother close friend of SpongeBob is Sandy Cheeks, a squirrel from Texas.[6] She is a scientist and an expert in karate.[7][8] She lives in an oak tree entrapped in a clear glass dome locked by an airtight, hand-turned seal. When outside of her dwelling, she wears an astronaut-like suit because she cannot breathe underwater.[5] Mr. Krabs, a miserly crab obsessed with money, is the owner of the Krusty Krab restaurant and SpongeBob\'s boss.[5] Krabs has a teenage whale daughter named Pearl, whom he values equally with his riches. His rival, Plankton, is a small green copepod who owns a low-rank fast-food restaurant called the Chum Bucket, located across the street from the Krusty Krab.[10] Plankton spends most of his time planning to steal the secret recipe for Mr. Krabs\'s popular Krabby Patty burgers, so as to gain the upper hand and put the Krusty Krab out of business.[11] The majority of Plankton\'s plans come from his intelligent yet sarcastic computer wife Karen, who is more competent and less conceited than him. When SpongeBob is not working at the Krusty Krab, he can often be found at Mrs. Puff\'s boating school (the underwater equivalent of a driver\'s education course). SpongeBob is perpetually unable to pass Mrs. Puff\'s exams, which is why he almost always walks around town.[12]\n\nOther recurring characters appear throughout the series, such as the muscular lifeguard of Goo Lagoon, Larry the Lobster; a pirate specter known as the Flying Dutchman; and retired superheroes Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy, who are idolized by SpongeBob and Patrick. Most double-length episodes of the show are hosted by a live action pirate named Patchy and his pet parrot Potty, whose segments are presented in a dual narrative with the animated stories.[13]\n\nThe series predominantly takes place in the benthic underwater city of Bikini Bottom which, according to some third-party sources, is located in the Pacific Ocean beneath the real-life coral reef known as Bikini Atoll.[14][15] In 2015, Tom Kenny confirmed that the fictitious city was named after Bikini Atoll, but denied an Internet fan theory that connected the series\' characters to actual nuclear testing that occurred in the atoll.[16]\n\nThe citizens live in mostly aquatic-themed buildings and use \"boatmobiles\", amalgamations of cars and boats, as a mode of transportation. Recurring establishments present in Bikini Bottom include two competing restaurants, the Krusty Krab and the Chum Bucket; Mrs. Puff\'s Boating School; and Shady Shoals Rest Home. Goo Lagoon, a popular beach hangout, is within the vicinity of the city, as is Jellyfish Fields. There are also a few episodes with businesses such as the grocery store, joke store, and mattress store.\n\nWhen the crew began production on the pilot, they were tasked with designing the stock locations where \"the show would return to again and again, and in which most of the action would take place, such as the Krusty Krab and SpongeBob\'s pineapple house\".[17] The idea for the series was \"to keep everything nautical\", so the crew used a great amount of rope, wooden planks, ships\' wheels, netting, anchors, boilerplates, and rivets in creating the show\'s setting. Bubbles filing up the screen is also a nautical technique used to transition from scene to scene.[17]\n\nThe series features \"sky flowers\" as a main setting material.[17] They first appeared in the pilot and have since become a common feature throughout the series.[17] When series background designer Kenny Pittenger was asked what they were, he answered, \"They function as clouds in a way, but since the show takes place underwater, they aren\'t really clouds\".[17] Since the series was influenced by tiki, the background painters have to use a lot of pattern.[17] Pittenger said that the sky flowers were meant to \"evoke the look of a flower-print Hawaiian shirt\".[17]\n\nSeries creator Stephen Hillenburg first became fascinated with the ocean as a child. Also at a young age, he began developing his artistic abilities. However, these two interests would not coincide for a long timethe idea of drawing fish seemed boring to him. During college, he majored in marine biology and minored in art. After graduating in 1984, he joined the Ocean Institute, an organization in Dana Point, California, dedicated to educating the public about marine science and maritime history.[18][19]\n\nWhile Hillenburg was there, he created a precursor to SpongeBob SquarePants: a comic book titled The Intertidal Zone, which was used by the institute to teach visiting students about the animal life of tide pools.[19] The comic starred various anthropomorphic sea lifeforms, many of which would evolve into SpongeBob characters. Hillenburg tried to get the comic professionally published, but none of the companies to which he sent it were interested.[19]\n\nDuring his time of employment at the Ocean Institute, Hillenburg attended an animation festival and determined that he wanted to pursue a career in that field. He had already been planning on returning to college for a master\'s degree in art. Instead, he chose to study experimental animation at the California Institute of the Arts.[19] His thesis film, Wormholes, is about the theory of relativity.[21] It was screened at festivals, and at one of these, Hillenburg met Joe Murray, creator of the popular Nickelodeon animated series, Rocko\'s Modern Life. Murray was impressed by the style of the film and offered Hillenburg a job.[21][22] Hillenburg joined the series as a director and later, during the fourth season, he took on the roles of producer and creative director.[21][22][23]\n\nMartin Olson, one of the writers for Rocko\'s Modern Life, read The Intertidal Zone and encouraged Hillenburg to create a television series with a similar concept. At that point, Hillenburg had not even considered creating his own series. However, he realized that if he ever did, this would be the best approach.[19][21] He began to further develop some of the characters from The Intertidal Zone, including the comic\'s \"announcer\", Bob the Sponge.[19] He wanted his series to stand out from most popular cartoons of the time, which he felt were exemplified by buddy comedies such as The Ren & Stimpy Show. As a result, Hillenburg decided to focus on one main character: the weirdest sea creature that he could think of. This led him to the sponge.[19] Bob the Sponge resembles an actual sea sponge, and at first Hillenburg continued this design.[19][21][22] In determining the new character\'s personality, Hillenburg drew inspiration from innocent, childlike figures that he enjoyed, such as Charlie Chaplin, Laurel and Hardy, Jerry Lewis, and Pee-wee Herman.[19][22][26][27] He then considered modeling the character after a kitchen sponge and realized that this idea would perfectly match the character\'s square personality.[19][21][22]\n\nTo voice the central character of the series, Hillenburg turned to Tom Kenny, whose career in animation had started alongside Hillenburg\'s on Rocko\'s Modern Life. Elements of Kenny\'s own personality were employed in further developing the character.[28][29] Initially, Hillenburg wanted to use the name SpongeBoy the character would have had no last name, and the series would have been called SpongeBoy Ahoy![30] However, the Nickelodeon legal department discovered after voice acting had been completed for the original seven-minute pilot episode that the name \"SpongeBoy\" was already in use for a mop product.[30] Flaming Carrot Comics creator Bob Burden also owned the trademark to a character of the same name.[31] In choosing a replacement name, Hillenburg felt that he still had to use the word \"Sponge\", so that viewers would not mistake the character for a \"Cheese Man\". He settled on the name \"SpongeBob\". \"SquarePants\" was then chosen as a family name after Kenny saw a picture of the character and remarked, \"Boy, look at this sponge in square pants, thinking he can get a job in a fast food place.\"[26] Hillenburg loved the phrase upon hearing Kenny say it and felt that it would reinforce the character\'s nerdiness.[26][32]\n\nIn 1997, while pitching the cartoon to Nickelodeon executives, Hillenburg donned a Hawaiian shirt, brought along an \"underwater terrarium with models of the characters\", and played Hawaiian music to set the theme. The setup was described by Nickelodeon executive Eric Coleman as \"pretty amazing\".[21] When they were given money and two weeks to write the pilot episode \"Help Wanted\",[21] Derek Drymon, Stephen Hillenberg, and Nick Jennings returned with what was described by Nickelodeon official Albie Hecht as, \"a performance [he] wished [he] had on tape\".[21] Although executive producer Derek Drymon described the pitch as stressful, he said it went \"very well\".[21] Kevin Kay and Hecht had to step outside because they were \"exhausted from laughing\", which worried the cartoonists.[21]\n\nIn an interview, Cyma Zarghami, the current president of Nickelodeon, said, \"their [Nickelodeon executives\'] immediate reaction was to see it again, both because they liked it and it was unlike anything they\'d ever seen before\".[34] Zarghami was one of four executives in the room when SpongeBob SquarePants was screened for the first time.[34]\n\nSeries creator Stephen Hillenburg has served as the executive producer over the course of the series\' entire history, and functioned as the showrunner from the series\' debut in 1999 until 2004. The series went on hiatus in 2002, after Hillenburg halted production to work on a feature film of the series, The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie.[31] Once the film was finalized and the third season finished, Hillenburg resigned as the series\' showrunner. Although he no longer has a direct role in the production of the series, he still maintains an advisory role and reviews each episode.[34][36]\n\nWhen the film was completed, Hillenburg intended for it to be the series finale, \"so [the show] wouldn\'t jump the shark.\" However, Nickelodeon wanted more episodes,[31] so Hillenburg appointed Paul Tibbitt, who previously served on the show as a writer, director, and storyboard artist, to take over his role as showrunner and produce further seasons.[37] Hillenburg considered Tibbitt one of his favorite members of the show\'s crew,[38] and \"totally trusted him\".[35] Tibbitt still holds the showrunner position, and has also functioned as a supervising producer since 2005 and an executive producer since 2008.[37][39]\n\nOn December 13, 2014, it was announced that Hillenburg would return to the series in an unspecified position.[40]\n\nFor SpongeBob SquarePants a team of five outline and premise writers creates the initial storylines. Writer Luke Brookshier said, \"SpongeBob is written differently than many television shows\".[41] Writing for an episode of the series starts with a two-page outline. A storyboard director then takes the outline and develops it into a full episode jokes and dialogue are added during this stage.[41][42] Another writer for the series, Merriwether Williams, described in an interview that she and Mr. Lawrence would write a draft for an episode in an afternoon and be done at 4 o\'clock.[42]\n\nHillenburg decided early on, prior to starting the production of the series, that he wanted SpongeBob SquarePants to be storyboard-driven, rather than script-driven.[43] This required an approach in which artists \"would take a skeletal story outline and flesh it out with sight gags, dialogue and a structure that would strike a balance between narrative and whimsy\".[43] Hillenburg originally wanted \"a team of young and hungry people\" to work on the series.[33] The primary figures, who had previously worked with Hillenburg on Rocko\'s Modern Life, consisted of Alan Smart, Nick Jennings, and Derek Drymon.[33] Head writer Steven Banks said, \"The writers come up with an idea and write premises and outlines describing the story, and the storyboarders (who are also writers) write the dialogue while they draw the storyboard panels. Most other shows are script-driven. We don\'t write scripts and that has made all the difference!\"[44]\n\nThe writing staff often used their individual life experiences for inspirations to come up with the storylines of the series\' episodes.[33][35] For example, the episode \"Sailor Mouth\", in which SpongeBob and Patrick learn profanity,[35] was inspired by creative director Derek Drymon\'s experience of getting in trouble as a child for using the f-word in front of his mother.[33] Drymon said, \"The scene where Patrick is running to Mr. Krabs to tattle, with SpongeBob chasing him, is pretty much how it happened in real life\".[33] The end of the episode, in which Mr. Krabs uses even more profanity than SpongeBob and Patrick, was inspired \"by the fact that my [Drymon\'s] mother has a sailor mouth herself\".[33] The idea for the episode \"The Secret Box\" also came from one of Drymon\'s childhood experiences.[35][45] Hillenburg explained, \"Drymon had a secret box [as a kid] and started telling us about it. We wanted to make fun of him and use it.\"[35]\n\nAlmost every episode is divided into two 11-minute segments. Hillenburg explained that \"[I] never really wanted to deliberately try to write a half-hour show\".[35] He added, \"I wrote the shows to where they felt right\".[35] Each 11-minute segment takes about five months to produce.[46][47]\n\nSpongeBob SquarePants has six main cast members: Tom Kenny, Bill Fagerbakke, Rodger Bumpass, Clancy Brown, Carolyn Lawrence, and Mr. Lawrence.\n\nKenny provides the voices of SpongeBob SquarePants, his pet snail Gary, the French Narrator, Harold SquarePants, Patchy the Pirate, and the Dirty Bubble. Kenny previously worked with Hillenburg on Rocko\'s Modern Life and, when Hillenburg created SpongeBob SquarePants, he approached Kenny to voice the character.[48] The voice of SpongeBob was originally used by Kenny for a minor background character in Rocko\'s Modern Life.[30] Kenny says that SpongeBob\'s high-pitched laugh was specifically created to be unique. They wanted an annoying laugh in the tradition of Popeye and Woody Woodpecker.[49]\n\nFagerbakke voices Patrick Star[50] and other miscellaneous characters. At the same time when Hillenburg, Derek Drymon, and Tim Hill were writing the pilot \"Help Wanted\", Hillenburg was also conducting auditions to find voices for the characters.[33] Fagerbakke auditioned for the role of Patrick after Kenny had been cast.[51] In an interview, Fagerbakke compared himself to the character and said, \"It\'s extremely gratifying\".[52] Fagerbakke modeled his performance whenever Patrick is angry after that of American actress Shelley Winters.[53]\n\nBumpass performs the voice of Squidward Tentacles and other miscellaneous characters. Arthur Brown, author of Everything I Need to Know, I Learned from Cartoons!, has compared Squidward\'s voice to that of Jack Benny\'s,[5] a similarity Bumpass says is mostly unintentional.[54] Hillenburg originally had Mr. Lawrence in mind for the role of voicing Squidward.[33]\n\nClancy Brown provides the voice of Mr. Krabs.[55]\n\nCarolyn Lawrence provides the voice of Sandy Cheeks.[56] Lawrence got the role of Sandy when she was in the Los Feliz neighborhood in Los Angeles. She met Donna Grillo, a casting director, on a sidewalk. Lawrence was with a friend who knew Grillo, and she said Lawrence had an interesting voice. Grillo brought in Lawrence to audition and she got the part of Sandy.[57][58] Lawrence modeled her performance of Sandy after that of American actress Holly Hunter.[59]\n\nMr. Lawrence voices Plankton. Drymon said, \"We knew Doug [Lawrence] from Rocko, where he was a storyboard director and where he also did the voice of Filburt. We were showing Doug the storyboard, and he started reading back to us in his Tony the Tiger/Gregory Peck voice. It was really funny, and we wound up having SpongeBob use a deep voice when he entered the Krusty Krab for the first time\".[33] Hillenburg loved the voice and decided to give Lawrence the part of series villain, Plankton.[33] Aside from Plankton, Mr. Lawrence also voices recurring characters like Larry Lobster.[60]\n\nKaren, Mrs. Puff, Pearl, and the Flying Dutchman are voiced by Kenny\'s wife Jill Talley,[61] Mary Jo Catlett,[62] Lori Alan[63] and Brian Doyle-Murray,[64] respectively.[65] Mr. Krabs\' mother, Mama Krabs, who debuted in the episode \"Sailor Mouth\", was voiced by writer Paul Tibbitt.[66][67][68] However, voice actress Sirena Irwin overtook Tibbitt\'s role as the character reappeared in the fourth-season episode \"Enemy In-Law\" in 2005.[69] Tom Kenny portrays Patchy the Pirate, the president of the fictional SpongeBob SquarePants fan club, while series creator Hillenburg voiced the character of Potty the Parrot.[70] After Hillenburg\'s departure as showrunner in 2004, Tibbitt was given the role in voicing Potty the Parrot.[71]\n\nIn addition to the regular cast, episodes feature guest voices from many ranges of professions, including actors, athletes, authors, musicians, and artists. Recurring guest voices include: Ernest Borgnine, who voiced Mermaid Man from 1999 until his death in 2012;[72] Tim Conway as the voice of Barnacle Boy;[73] and Marion Ross as Grandma SquarePants.[74] Notable guests who have provided vocal cameo appearances includes David Bowie as Lord Royal Highness in the television film Atlantis SquarePantis,[75][76] John Goodman as the voice of Santa in the episode \"It\'s a SpongeBob Christmas!\", Johnny Depp as the voice of the surf guru, Jack Kahuna Laguna, in the episode \"SpongeBob SquarePants vs. The Big One\",[77] and Victoria Beckham as the voice of Queen Amphitrite in the episode \"The Clash of Triton\".[78][79]\n\nVoice recording sessions always include a full cast of actors, which Kenny describes as \"getting more unusual\".[80] Kenny said, \"That\'s another thing that\'s given SpongeBob its special feel. Everybody\'s in the same room, doing it old radio-show style. It\'s how the stuff we like was recorded\".[80] Series writer Jay Lender said, \"The recording sessions were always fun ...\"[81] For the first three seasons, Hillenburg and Drymon sat in on the record studio, and they directed the actors.[82] In the fourth season, Andrea Romano took over the role as the voice director.[82] Wednesday is recording day, the same schedule followed by the crew since 1999.[82] Casting supervisor Jennie Monica Hammond said, \"I loved Wednesdays\".[82]\n\nApproximately 50 people work together in animating and producing an episode of SpongeBob SquarePants.[41] Throughout its run, production of the series has been handled domestically at Nickelodeon Animation Studio in Burbank, California, while the finished animation has been created overseas at Rough Draft Studios in South Korea.[35][83] Storyboarding for each episode is done by the crew in California. The storyboards are then used as templates by the crew in Korea,[35] who animate by hand, color cels on computers, and paint backgrounds. Episodes are finished in California, where they are edited and have music added.[41] Every season, character designs are updated or modified to solve technical issues in the animation.[84]\n\nDuring the first season, the series used cel animation.[37] A shift was made the following year to digital ink and paint animation.[37] In 2009, executive producer Paul Tibbitt said \"The first season of SpongeBob was done the old-fashioned way on cells, and every cell had to be part-painted, left to dry, paint some other colours. It\'s still a time-consuming aspect of the process now, but the digital way of doing things means it doesn\'t take long to correct\".[37]\n\nIn 2008, the crew shifted to using Wacom Cintiqs for the drawings instead of pencils.[31] The fifth season episode \"Pest of the West\" was the first episode in the series to which the crew applied this method.[85] Series background designer Kenny Pittenger said, \"The only real difference between the way we draw now and the way we drew then is that we abandoned pencil and paper during the fifth season\".[31] The crew began the shift while they were working on the episode. Pittenger said, \"It was while we were working on \'Pest of the West\', one of the half-hour specials, that we made the switch ... did you notice?\"[31] The shift to Wacom Cintiqs let the designers and animators draw on computer screens and make immediate changes or undo mistakes. Pittenger said, \"Many neo-Ludditeser ... I mean, many of my cohortsdon\'t like working on them, but I find them useful. There\'s no substitute for the immediacy of drawing on a piece of paper, of course, but digital nautical nonsense is still pretty fun\".[31]\n\nA stop-motion opening sequence for the series\' 10th anniversary special was created by LA-based animation studio Screen Novelties.[86] The group was re-enlisted a few years later to produce the eighth season episode \"It\'s a SpongeBob Christmas!\" This was the first full-length episode in the series to be produced in stop motion animation.[88][89] Mark Caballero, Seamus Walsh, and Christopher Finnegan of Screen Novelties animated the episode, and Caballero and Walsh also served as its directors.[90]\n\nThe theme song was composed by Mark Harrison and Blaise Smith,[92] while the lyrics to the song were written by series creator Stephen Hillenburg and the series\' original creative director Derek Drymon. The melody was inspired by the sea shanty \"Blow the Man Down\".[22] An old oil painting of a pirate is used in the opening sequence. It has been dubbed \"Painty the Pirate\", and according to Tom Kenny, Hillenburg found it in a thrift shop \"years ago\".[30] Patrick Pinney gives voice to Painty the Pirate, singing the theme song as the character.[22] Hillenburg\'s lips were imposed onto the painting and move along with the lyrics.[30] Kenny joked that this is \"about as close of a glimpse as most SpongeBob fans are ever going to get of Steve Hillenburg\", because of Hillenburg\'s private nature.[22]\n\nA cover of the song by Avril Lavigne can be found on the SpongeBob SquarePants Movie soundtrack.[93][94] Another cover by the Violent Femmes aired on Nickelodeon as a promotion for the series moving to prime time.[95]\n\nSteve Belfer, one of Hillenburg\'s friends from CalArts, wrote and performed the music that is played over the end credits.[33] This theme includes ukulele music, per Hillenburg\'s request.[33] Drymon said, \"It\'s so long ago, it\'s hard to be sure, but I remember Hillenburg having the Belfer music early on, maybe before the pilot\".[33]\n\nThe series\' music editor and main composer is Nicolas Carr.[91] After working with Hillenburg on Rocko\'s Modern Life, Carr struggled to find a new job in his field. He had been considering a career change when Hillenburg offered him the job. The first season\'s score primarily featured selections from the Associated Production Music Library, which Carr has said includes \"lots of great old corny Hawaiian music and big, full, dramatic orchestral scores.\"[91] Rocko\'s Modern Life also used music from this library. It was Hillenburg\'s decision to adopt the approach. The selections for SpongeBob SquarePants have been described by Carr as being \"more over-the-top\" than those for Rocko\'s Modern Life.[91]\n\nHillenburg also felt that it was important for the series to develop its own music library, consisting of scores that could be reused and re-edited throughout the years. He wanted these scores to be composed by unknowns, and a group of twelve was assembled. They formed \"The Sponge Divers Orchestra\", which includes Carr and Belfer. This group went on to provide the majority of the music for later seasons, although Carr still draws from the Associated Production Music Library, as well as another library that he founded himself Animation Music Inc.[91]\n\nNickelodeon began celebrating the 10th anniversary of the series on January 18, 2009 with a live cast reading of the episode \"SpongeBob vs. The Big One\". The reading a first for the series was held at that year\'s Sundance Film Festival.[99][100] The episode, which would not premiere on TV until April 17, featured Johnny Depp as a guest star.[101] Other celebratory actions taken by the network included the launching of a new website for the series (spongebob.com) and the introduction of new merchandising. A \"SpongeBob and water conservation-themed element\" was also added to Nickelodeon\'s pro-social campaign The Big Green Help.[99] In an interview, Tom Kenny said, \"What I\'m most proud of is that kids still really like [SpongeBob SquarePants] and care about it ... They eagerly await new episodes. People who were young children when it started 10 years ago are still watching it and digging it and think it\'s funny. That\'s the loving cup for me\".[102]\n\nThree nights before the official anniversary date, an hour-long documentary of the series, Square Roots: The Story of SpongeBob SquarePants, premiered on VH1.[98][99][100][102][103] Critically acclaimed duo Patrick Creadon and Christine O\'Malley created the film as a followup to I.O.U.S.A.  a documentary on America\'s financial situation. Creadon remarked, \"After spending two years examining the financial health of the United States, Christine and I were ready to tackle something a little more upbeat. Telling the SpongeBob story feels like the perfect fit.\"[99] On Friday July 17, Nickelodeon marked the official anniversary of the series, with a 50-hour television marathon titled \"The Ultimate SpongeBob SpongeBash Weekend\". The marathon began with a new episode, \"To SquarePants or Not to SquarePants\". Saturday saw a countdown of the top ten episodes as picked by fans, as well as an airing of The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie. The marathon finished on Sunday, which saw a countdown of episodes as picked by celebrities, as well as the premiere of ten new episodes.[99][104][105]\n\nNickelodeon continued celebrating the anniversary through the rest of the year. An eight-episode DVD set featuring \"To SquarePants or Not to SquarePants\" shortly followed the marathon, with a July 21 release.[106][107] Next a 2,200 minute, 14-disc DVD set titled The First 100 Episodes was released on September 22.[107][108][109] Finally, on November 6, an hour-long television film, titled Truth or Square, debuted on Nickelodeon. The film is narrated by Ricky Gervais and features live action cameo appearances by Rosario Dawson, Craig Ferguson, Will Ferrell, Tina Fey, LeBron James, P!nk, Triumph the Insult Comic Dog, and Robin Williams.[110][111][112] It was released as part of a five-episode DVD set on November 10.[113]\n\nWithin its first month on air, SpongeBob SquarePants overtook Pokmon\'s position as the highest rated Saturday-morning children\'s series. It held an average national Nielsen rating of 4.9 among children aged two through eleven, denoting 1.9 million viewers.[114][115] Two years later, the series had firmly established itself as Nickelodeon\'s second highest rated children\'s program, after Rugrats. It had gained a significant adult audience by that point  nearly 40 percent of the series\' 2.2 million viewers were aged 18 to 34.[116] That year, 2001, Nickelodeon took the \"Saturday-morning ratings crown\" for the fourth straight season.[117] In response to this weekend-found success, the studio gave SpongeBob SquarePants time slots at 6 PM and 8 PM, Monday through Thursday, to increase exposure of the series.[116][118] By the end of that year SpongeBob SquarePants boasted the highest ratings for any children\'s series, not only on Nickelodeon, but on all of television.[119][120][121] Weekly viewership of the series had reached around fifteen million, at least five million of which were adults.[119]\n\nIn October 2002, another Nickelodeon series titled The Fairly OddParents ranked as the No. 2 program for children between 2 and 11 years old.[122] Its ratings at that time were almost equal to SpongeBob SquarePants\' then-average of 2.2 million viewers per episode.[122] The Fairly OddParents even briefly surpassed SpongeBob SquarePants, causing the latter series to drop into second place  at this time The Fairly OddParents had a 6.2 rating and nearly 2.5 million child viewers, while SpongeBob SquarePants had a 6.0 rating and 2.4 million kids 211.[123] Nickelodeon \"recognized\" The Fairly OddParents for its climbing ratings and installed it into a new 8 P.M. time slot, previously occupied by SpongeBob SquarePants.[122] In an interview, Cyma Zarghami, then-general manager and executive vice president of Nickelodeon, said, \"Are we banking on the fact that Fairly OddParents will be the next SpongeBob? ... We are hoping. But SpongeBob is so unique, it\'s hard to say if it will ever be repeated\".[122]\n\nHowever, in 2012, it was reported that the series\' ratings were declining.[124][125] The average number of viewers aged 2 to 11 watching SpongeBob at any given time dropped 29% in the first quarter from a year earlier, according to Nielsen.[126] Wall Street Journal business writer John Jannarone suggested that the age of the series and oversaturation of the series might be contributing to the decline of the series\' ratings, and might also be directly responsible for the decline in Nickelodeon\'s overall ratings.[127] Media analyst Todd Juenger directly attributes the decline in Nickelodeon\'s ratings to the availability of streaming video content on services like Netflix, a provider of on-demand Internet streaming media.[128]\n\nPhilippe Dauman, the president and CEO of Viacom, contradicted the notion, saying he did not think \"the limited amount of Nick library content on Netflix ... has had a significant impact\".[129][130] A Nickelodeon spokesman said SpongeBob is performing consistently well and remains the number one rated animated series in all of children\'s television.[127] He added, \"There is nothing that we have seen that points to SpongeBob as a problem\".[127] Dauman blamed the drop on \"some ratings systemic issues\" at Nielsen, citing extensive set-top-box data that \"does in no way reflect\" the Nielsen data.[131]\n\nJuenger noted that SpongeBob could affect the ratings of other Nickelodeon programming because children often change channels to find their favorite programs, then stay tuned into that network.[127] Nickelodeon recently reduced its exposure in television. In the first quarter of 2012, the network cut back on the number of episodes it aired by 16% compared with a year earlier.[127]\n\nOn April 22, 2013, Netflix CEO Reed Hastings announced their intentions not to renew their existing deal with Viacom.[132] Since then, Viacom\'s deal with Netflix expired, and shows such as SpongeBob and Dora the Explorer were removed.[133] On June 4, 2013, Viacom announced a multi-year licensing agreement which would move its programs, such as SpongeBob and Dora the Explorer, to Amazon.com, Netflix\'s top competitor.[134][135] Amazon agreed to pay more than $200 million to Viacom for the license, its largest subscription streaming transaction ever.[136][137]\n\nSpongeBob SquarePants is one of the longest-running series on Nickelodeon.[138] It became the Nickelodeon series with the most episodes, during its eighth season, surpassing the 172 episodes of Rugrats with 178.[139] In its ninth season, a total of 26 episodes pushed the series over the 200th episode mark, reaching 204 produced episodes.[140][141][142] In a statement, Brown Johnson, animation president for Nickelodeon, said, \"SpongeBob\'s success in reaching over 200 episodes is a testament to creator Stephen Hillenburg\'s vision, comedic sensibility and his dynamic, lovable characters. The series now joins the club of contemporary classic Nicktoons that have hit this benchmark, so we\'re incredibly proud\".[143][144]\n\nSpongeBob SquarePants has received generally positive reviews from critics, and it has been noted for its appeal towards different age groups. James Poniewozik of Time magazine described the title character as \"the anti-Bart Simpson, temperamentally and physically: his head is as squared-off and neat as Bart\'s is unruly, and he has a personality to matchconscientious, optimistic and blind to the faults in the world and those around him\".[145] According to Laura Fries of Variety magazine, the series is \"a thoughtful and inventive cartoon about a hopelessly optimistic and resilient sea sponge ... Devoid of the double entendres rife in today\'s animated TV shows, this is purely kid\'s stuff ... However, that\'s not to say that SpongeBob is simplistic or even juvenile. It\'s charming and whimsical, but clever enough to appeal to teens and college-aged kids, as well\".[146] The New York Times critic Joyce Millman said SpongeBob \"is clever without being impenetrable to young viewers and goofy without boring grown-ups to tears. It\'s the most charming toon on television, and one of the weirdest. And it\'s also good, clean fun, which makes sense because it is, after all, about a sponge\". Millman wrote, \"His relentless good cheer would be irritating if he weren\'t so darned lovable and his world so excellently strange ... Like Pee-wee\'s Playhouse, SpongeBob joyfully dances on the fine line between childhood and adulthood, guilelessness and camp, the warped and the sweet\".[147]\n\nRobert Thompson, a professor of communications and director of the Center for the Study of Popular Television at Syracuse University, told The New York Times, \"There is something kind of unique about [SpongeBob]. It seems to be a refreshing breath from the pre-irony era. There\'s no sense of the elbow-in-rib, tongue-in-cheek aesthetic that so permeates the rest of American cultureincluding kids\' shows like the Rugrats. I think what\'s subversive about it is it\'s so incredibly naivedeliberately. Because there\'s nothing in it that\'s trying to be hip or cool or anything else, hipness can be grafted onto it\".[148] In another interview with LA Times, he commentated on the show\'s adult audience: \"[On one hand] It\'s a kind of time machine that transports parents back to when they watched TV in their footie [pajamas]. On the other hand, it\'s very hip in the way it\'s presented. It is very edgy to adults who know how to read and listen between the frames.\"[149] In a 2007 interview, Barack Obama named SpongeBob his favorite TV character and admitted that SpongeBob SquarePants is \"the show I watch with my daughters\".[150][151][152] British Prime Minister Gordon Brown has also said he watches the series with his children.[34]\n\nSpongeBob SquarePants has received many awards and nominations; among these are two Emmy Awards (\"Outstanding Special Class Animated Program\" in 2010[153] and \"Outstanding Sound Editing  Animation\" in 2014);[154] six Annie Awards;[155][156][157][158][159][160] and two BAFTA Children\'s Awards.[161][162] Television critics Alan Sepinwall and Matt Zoller Seitz included the series in their 2016 book TV (The Book) as the 22nd greatest American television series of all time, stating that \"SpongeBob SquarePants is an absurdist masterpiece that Salvador Dal and Groucho Marx would have watched together in their smoking jackets\".[163][164] In 2006, IGN ranked SpongeBob SquarePants 15th on its list, \"Top 25 Animated Series of All Time\",[165] and in 2013, it ranked the series 12th on its list, \"The Top 25 Animated Series for Adults\".[166] Additionally, the website\'s UK division ran a \"Top 100 Animated Series\" list, and like its US counterpart, ranked SpongeBob SquarePants 15th.[167]\n\nThe series is among the \"All-TIME 100 TV Shows\" as chosen by Time television critic James Poniewozik in 2007. He said, \"It\'s the most funny, surreal, inventive example of the explosion in creative kids\' (and adult) entertainment that Nick, Cartoon Network and their ilk made possible\".[168] Viewers of the UK television network Channel 4 voted SpongeBob SquarePants the 28th \"Greatest Cartoon\" in a 2004 poll.[169][170] TV Guide listed the character of SpongeBob SquarePants at No. 9 for its \"50 Greatest Cartoon Characters of All Time\".[171] In 2013, the publication ranked SpongeBob SquarePants the eighth \"Greatest TV Cartoon of All Time\".[172] In June 2010, Entertainment Weekly named SpongeBob one of the \"100 Greatest Characters of the Last 20 Years\".[173]\n\nIn July 2009, Madame Tussauds wax museum in New York launched a wax sculpture of SpongeBob in celebration of the series\' 10th anniversary. This made SpongeBob the first animated character to ever receive a statue made entirely out of wax.[174][175][176][177] In May 2011, a new species of mushroom, Spongiforma squarepantsii, was described, named after the series\' title character.[178]\n\nThe character has also become a trend in Egypt at Cairo\'s Tahrir Square.[179] After the Egyptian Revolution of 2011, SpongeBob became a fashion phenomenon, appearing on various items of merchandise from hijabs to boxer shorts.[180][181] The phenomenon led to the creation of the Tumblr project called \"SpongeBob on the Nile\". The project was founded by American students Andrew Leber and Elisabeth Jaquette and attempts to document every appearance of SpongeBob in Egypt.[182] Sherief Elkeshta cited the phenomenon in an essay about the incoherent state of politics in Egypt in an independent monthly paper titled Midan Masr. He wrote, \"Why isn\'t he [SpongeBob] at least holding a Molotov cocktail? Or raising a fist?\"[183] The phenomenon has even spread to Libya, where a Libyan rebel in SpongeBob dress was photographed celebrating the revolution.[184] Although The Guardian and Vice have asserted that the trend has little to no political significance,[179][180] \"joke\" presidential campaigns have been undertaken for SpongeBob in Egypt and Syria.[180][182]\n\nA clip was posted to YouTube in February 2013 that features soldiers in the Russian army and navy singing the SpongeBob SquarePants theme song as they march.[185][186] According to the website that uploaded the video, this is one of the \"most popular marching songs\" in the Russian military.[185] The video garnered nearly 50,000 views within its first week.[186]\n\nIn 2005, a promotional video which showed SpongeBob and other characters from children\'s shows singing together to promote diversity and tolerance was attacked by an evangelical group in the United States because they saw SpongeBob as being used to \"advocate homosexuality\".[187][188] James Dobson of Focus on the Family accused the video of promoting homosexuality, due to it being sponsored by a pro-tolerance group.[188] The incident accentuated questions as to whether or not SpongeBob is gay. Although the character has enjoyed popularity with gay viewers, series creator Stephen Hillenburg had already denied the issue three years earlier, clarifying at the time that he considers the character to be \"somewhat asexual\".[189] After Dobson\'s comments, Hillenburg reasserted his position, stating that sexual preference does not play a part in what they are \"trying to do\" with the series.[190][191] Tom Kenny and other production members were distraught that such an issue had arisen.[30]\n\nDobson later stated that his comments were taken out of context, and that his original complaints were not with SpongeBob, the video, or any of the characters in the video, but rather with the organization that sponsored the video, the We Are Family Foundation. Dobson indicated that the We Are Family Foundation posted pro-gay material on their website, but later removed it.[192] After the controversy, John H. Thomas, the United Church of Christ\'s general minister and president, said they would welcome SpongeBob into their ministry. He said \"Jesus didn\'t turn people away. Neither do we\".[193]\n\nJeffery P. Dennis, author of the journal article \"Queertoons\", argued that SpongeBob and Sandy are not romantically in love, while adding that he believed that SpongeBob and Patrick \"are paired with arguably erotic intensity\".[194] Martin Goodman of Animation World Magazine described Dennis\' comments regarding SpongeBob and Patrick as \"interesting\".[195][a] Ukrainian website Family Under the Protection of the Holy Virgin, which has been described as a \"fringe Catholic\" group by The Wall Street Journal, levied criticism against SpongeBob SquarePants for its alleged \"promotion of homosexuality\".[197] The group sought to have the series banned, along with several other popular children\'s properties. The National Expert Commission of Ukraine on the Protection of Public Morality took up the matter for review in August 2012.[197]\n\nIn April 2009, Burger King released a SpongeBob-themed advertisement featuring a parody of Sir Mix-a-Lot\'s song \"Baby Got Back\". The Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood protested the ad for being sexist and inappropriately sexual, especially contemplating that SpongeBob\'s fan base includes young children.[198][199][200][201][202] In official statements released by Burger King and Nickelodeon, both companies claimed that the campaign was aimed at parents.[201][202]\n\nA 2011 study conducted at the University of Virginia and published in the journal Pediatrics suggested that allowing preschool-aged audiences to watch the series caused short-term disruptions in mental function and attention span due to frequent shot changes.[204][205] A Nickelodeon executive responded in an interview that the series was not intended for an audience of that age and that the study used \"questionable methodology and could not possibly provide the basis for any valid findings that parents could trust\".[206][207]\n\nCritics\' reviews of early SpongeBob episodes praised the show for its wit, clever humor, and \"uncanny brilliance\".[attribution needed][208] However, in 2007, around the airing of season five, the tone and emphasis of the show began to change. Some fans \"began to turn away from the show\",[attribution needed] causing online fansites to \"[become] deserted\".[attribution needed][126] They pointed to a shift from clever humor to what they perceived as \"boring, unfunny humor... geared too much towards children\".[attribution needed][209]\n\nPaul Tibbitt, showrunner from season four to the season 9 episode, \"SpongeBob, You\'re Fired!\" has been the subject of criticism.[209] While The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie was generally well received by fans of the show, it is also considered a turning point in the show\'s history, as many fans believe the decline occurred after the film\'s release,[126] when Stephen Hillenburg resigned as showrunner and Tibbitt was appointed to replace him. Episodes produced since the movie have been variously categorized as \"kid-pandering attention-waster[s]\",[210] \"tedious\",[211] \"boring\" and \"dreck\",[212] a \"depressing plateau of mediocrity\",[213] and \"laugh-skimpy\".[214]\n\nIn February 2011, creator Hillenburg first announced the release of the 32-page bimonthly comic book series, SpongeBob Comics, based on the show.[244][245] The release marked the first time Hillenburg authored his own books. He said, \"I\'m hoping that fans will enjoy finally having a SpongeBob comic book from me\".[244][245] The comic book series is published by Hillenburg\'s production company, United Plankton Pictures, and distributed by Bongo Comics Group.[244][245] Although the characters of the series had previously appeared in Nickelodeon Magazine and in Cine-Manga, the first issue of SpongeBob Comics marked the first time the characters have appeared in their own comic books in the United States.[244][245] Hillenburg described the stories from the comic books as \"original and always true to the humor, characters, and universe of the SpongeBob SquarePants series\".[244][245]\n\nChris Duffy, the former senior editor of Nickelodeon Magazine, serves as managing editor of SpongeBob Comics.[244][245] Hillenburg and Duffy met with various cartoonistsincluding James Kochalka, Hilary Barta, Graham Annable, Gregg Schigiel, and Jacob Chabotto contribute to each issues.[244][245] Retired horror comics writer and artist Stephen R. Bissette returned to write a special Halloween issue in 2012, with Tony Millionaire and Al Jaffee.[246] In an interview with Tom Spurgeon, Bissette said, \"I\'ve even broken my retirement to do one work-for-hire gig [for SpongeBob Comics] so I could share everything about that kind of current job\".[247]\n\nIn the United Kingdom, Titan Magazines publishes comics based on SpongeBob SquarePants every four weeks. These comics were first published on February 3, 2005.[248] Titan Magazines teamed-up with Lego to release a limited edition SpongeBob-themed comic.[249]\n\nParamount Pictures and Nickelodeon Movies produced The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie, an animated film adaptation of the series that was released on November 19, 2004.[250] The film was directed by creator Stephen Hillenburg, and was written by long-time series writers comprising Hillenburg, Derek Drymon, Tim Hill, Kent Osborne, Aaron Springer, and Paul Tibbitt. Hillenburg and Julia Pistor produced the film, while the film score was composed by Gregor Narholz.[251][252][253] The film is about Plankton\'s evil plan to steal King Neptune\'s crown and send it to Shell City. SpongeBob and Patrick must retrieve it and save Mr. Krabs\' life from Neptune\'s raft and their home, Bikini Bottom, from Plankton\'s plan. The film features guest appearances by Jeffrey Tambor as King Neptune, Scarlett Johansson as the King\'s daughter Mindy, Alec Baldwin as Dennis, and David Hasselhoff as himself.[254] It received positive critical reception,[255][256] and grossed over $140 million worldwide.[257]\n\nTwo television films were released. The two television films are SpongeBob\'s Atlantis SquarePantis released in 2007 and SpongeBob\'s Truth or Square released in 2009.\n\nA sequel to the 2004 film was released in theaters on February 6, 2015.[258] The series\' main cast members are reprise their roles,[259] and the underwater parts are traditionally animated in the manner of the series and the live-action parts uses CGI animation with the SpongeBob characters.[260][261] The film has a budget similar to the previous film and did not cost more than $100 million to produce.[262][263][264]\n\nOn April 30, 2015, Viacom announced a third movie was in development.[265] On August 3, 2015, via Twitter, Vincent Waller confirmed that the sequel is in pre-production and that Paul Tibbitt will once again direct.[266]\n\nCollections of original music featured in the series have been released on the albums SpongeBob SquarePants: Original Theme Highlights (2001), SpongeBob\'s Greatest Hits (2009), and The Yellow Album (2005). The first two charted on the US Billboard 200, reaching number 171 and 122, respectively.[267][268] Several songs have been recorded with the purpose of a single or album release, and have not been featured on the show. For example, the song \"My Tidy Whities\" written by Tom Kenny and Andy Paley was released only for the album The Best Day Ever (2006). Kenny\'s inspiration for the song was \"underwear humor\".[269] Kenny said, \"Underwear humor is always a surefire laugh-getter with kids ... Just seeing a character that odd wearing really prosaic, normal, Kmart, three-to-a-pack underwear is a funny drawing ... We thought it was funny to make a really lush, beautiful love song to his underwear\".[269] The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie  Music from the Movie and More..., a soundtrack album featuring the score of The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie, was released along with the feature-length film in November 2004. Various artists including the Flaming Lips,[270] Wilco,[271] Ween,[272] Motrhead,[273] the Shins,[274] and Avril Lavigne[275] contributed to the soundtrack that reached number 76 on the US Billboard 200.[276]\n\nSpongeBob SquarePants 4-D film and ride opened in various locations, including Six Flags Over Texas, Flamingo Land Resort, and the Shedd Aquarium.[277] The ride features water squirts, real bubbles, and other sensory enhancements. In 2012, Nickelodeon teamed up again with SimEx-Iwerks Entertainment and Super 78 to produce SpongeBob SquarePants 4-D: The Great Jelly Rescue.[278] The attraction opened in early 2013 at the Mystic Aquarium & Institute for Exploration.[279] The attraction was also released at the Nickelodeon Suites Resort Orlando in Orlando, Florida.[280][281][282] The seven-minute film follows SpongeBob, Patrick and Sandy to their old hijinks while rescuing the jellyfish of Jellyfish Fields from Plankton\'s evil clutches.[279]\n\nSpongeBob SquarePants appears at the Mall of America\'s Nickelodeon theme park re-branded from the Mall of America\'s Park at MOA, formerly Camp Snoopy, to Nickelodeon Universe in the Minneapolis-St. Paul suburb of Bloomington, Minnesota. The new theme park features a SpongeBob-themed Gerstlauer Euro-Fighter custom roller coaster, the SpongeBob SquarePants Rock Bottom Plunge, which has replaced the Mystery Mine Ride and Olde Time Photo store on the west end of the theme park, which opened March 15, 2008.[283][284]\n\nOn May 23, 2015, an interactive 3D show titled \"SpongeBob SubPants Adventure\" opened in Texas at Moody Gardens. According to Moody Gardens President and CEO John Zendt, \"Visitors will be able to interact with the Nickelodeon characters on a digital stage as they have never been able to do before.\"[285][286][287]\n\nNumerous video games based on the series have been produced. Some of the early games include Legend of the Lost Spatula (2001)[288] and SpongeBob SquarePants: Battle for Bikini Bottom (2003).[289] The 2003 video game was added to the Greatest Hits by Sony.[290][291] It also served as the engine basis for a video game based on the The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie. Heavy Iron Studios, the game\'s developers, tweaked the graphics to give the game a sharper and more imaginative look than that of Battle for Bikini Bottom. They also increased the polygon count, added several racing levels, and incorporated many of the creatures seen in the film.[292] In 2013, Nickelodeon published and distributed SpongeBob Moves In!, a freemium city-building game app developed by Kung Fu Factory for iOS.[293][294][295][296]\n\nNickelodeon launched the first global SpongeBob SquarePants-themed short film competition, SpongeBob SquareShorts: Original Fan Tributes, in 2013.[297][298] The contest encourages fans and filmmakers around the world to create original short films inspired by SpongeBob for a chance to win a prize and a trip for four people to a screening event in Hollywood. The contest opened on May 6 and ran through June 28, 2013.[299][300] On July 19, 2013, Nickelodeon announced the finalists for the competition,[301][302][303] and, on August 13, 2013, the \"under 18 years of age\" category was won by David of the United States for his \"The Krabby Commercial\", while the \"Finally Home\" short by Nicole of South Africa won the \"18 and over\" category.[304]\n\nThe popularity of SpongeBob SquarePants inspired merchandise from T-shirts to posters.[50] It was reported that the franchise generated an estimated $8 billion merchandising revenue for Nickelodeon.[305] It is also the most distributed property of MTV Networks.[272] SpongeBob is viewed in 170 countries speaking 24 languages, and has also become \"a killer merchandising app\".[306] The title character and his friends have been used as a theme for special editions of well-known family board games, including Monopoly,[307] Life,[308] and Operation,[309] as well as a SpongeBob SquarePants edition of Ants in the Pants,[310] and Yahtzee.[311]\n\nIn 2001, SpongeBob SquarePants signed a marketing deal with Target Corporation and Burger King, expanding its merchandising.[116] The popularity of SpongeBob has translated well into sales figures. In 2002, SpongeBob SquarePants dolls sold at a rate of 75,000 per week, which was faster than Tickle Me Elmo dolls were selling at the time.[312] SpongeBob has gained popularity in Japan, specifically with Japanese women. Nickelodeon\'s parent company Viacom purposefully targeted marketing at women in the country. Skeptics initially doubted that SpongeBob could be popular in Japan, as the character\'s design is very different from already popular designs for Hello Kitty and Pikachu.[313] Ratings and merchandise sales showed SpongeBob SquarePants has caught on with parents and with college audiences.[314] In a recent promotion, college-oriented website Music.com gave away 80,000 SpongeBob T-shirts, four times more than during a similar promotion for Comedy Central\'s South Park.[314]\n\nKids\' meal tie-ins have been released in snacks and fast food restaurants in many parts of the world, including Burger King in Europe and North America, as well as Wendy\'s in North America, and Hungry Jack\'s in Australia. A McDonald\'s Happy Meal tie-in with SpongeBob-themed Happy Meal boxes and toys was released in Europe and other international markets in the summer of 2007.[315] In Australia, the advertisement for the McDonald\'s SpongeBob Happy Meal won the Pester Power Award because the ads are entice young children to want its food because of the free toy.[316] As a tie-in beverage for the DVD release of The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie, 7-Eleven released the limited edition \"Under-the-Sea Pineapple Slurpee\" in March 2004.[317] Pirate\'s Booty released limited edition SpongeBob SquarePants Pirate\'s Booty snacks in 2013.[318][319]\n\nIn 2007, high-end SpongeBob-themed electronics have been introduced by Imation Electronics Products under the Npower brand, including MP3 players, digital cameras, a DVD player, and a flatscreen television.[320] Pictures of SpongeBob SquarePants also began to appear on the labels of 8 oz. cans of Green Giant cut green beans and frozen packages of Green Giant green beans and butter sauce, which featured free stickers in 2007 as part of an initiative to encourage kids to eat their vegetables.[321] The Simmons Jewelry Co. released a $75,000 diamond pendant as part of a SpongeBob collection.[176][322] In New Zealand, the UK-based Beechdean Group unveiled the SpongeBob SquarePants Vanilla Ice Cream character product as part of a licence deal with Nickelodeon.[323] NZ Drinks launched the SpongeBob SquarePants bottled water.[324]\n\nBuild-A-Bear Workshop introduced the new SpongeBob SqaurePants collection in stores and online in North America on May 17, 2013.[325][326][327] Shoppers can dress their SpongeBob and Patrick plush in a variety of clothing and accessories. Sandy Cheeks and Gary the Snail are also available as pre-stuffed minis.[328] Build-A-Bear Workshop stores nationwide celebrated the arrival of SpongeBob with a series of special events from May 17 through May 19.[329]\n\nOn July 13, 2013, Toyota, with Nickelodeon, unveiled a SpongeBob-inspired Toyota Highlander.[330] The 2014 Toyota Highlander was launched on SpongeBob Day at the San Diego\'s Giants v.

Their main point of evidence seems to rest on claims that they scoured through previous debate footage of Clinton and couldnt a single instance of her touching her face.\n\nPerhaps knowing how implausible this would sound to rational people across the political spectrum, the site wants us to know they get it, this sounds absolutely nuts. But no, dont walk away. We can explain everything:\n\nAnd as with any conspiracy theory, good or bad, there seem to be a ton of people perfectly willing to align themselves with it in the face of healthy skepticism. Or, even, you know, actual evidence.Adding fuel to the fire, the video was reportedly taken down from YouTube after a number of user complaints.\n\nAnother site even asked professional poker player Mike Matusow to weigh in and he totally agrees: Hillary Clinton was cheating. Of course, one quick scroll through his Twitter reveals a series of borderline unhinged missives about Clinton, accusing her of murder amongst other crimes. Along with being a 4 time World Series of Poker champion, his own bio also lists him as operating in the formal capacity of current political activist against Hillary Rotten Clinton. So, you know, an authority figure.\n\nSadly, this is just the latest conspiracy theory to emerge less than 48 hours since Trump and Clinton held their first debate. Within moments, a number of people were claiming that Clinton wore a secret earpiece feeding her answers and lines to use against Trump. A similarly unsubstantiated claim was made by liberals against George W. Bush during his 2004 debates with John Kerry.\n\nThings have gotten so crazy that Snopes, the site dedicated to debunking or confirming rumors, weighed in. Heres what they had to say:\n\nThe above-displayed video does not provide any evidence that Hillary Clinton and Lester Holt communicated via hand signals so that Clinton could indicate to Holt when she wanted him to call on her so she could get in a \"zinger.\" The creator of the video simply strung together several unrelated events  Clinton scratching her face, Holt making a comment, Clinton replying to Trump  and then claimed that they were somehow connected to a furtive signaling plot without providing any proof.','2017-03-25 03:51:13'),(473,63,'72ec08f85c10026c82b8ccf4c61df421c20f204a64de736d38b8085b531144e8','3d50fb870cb64353bc4ffc680e3dff0d','','','A compelling claim now gaining traction among angry shut-ins, Tinfoil Hat Monthly subscribers and other avid Donald Trump supporters suggests that Hillary Clinton communicated with the moderator Lester Holt via subtle and not-so-subtle hand signals throughout the Sept. 26 Trumpalooza  er, debate  at Hofstra University.\n\nIn fact, no less an authority on conspiracies than Rush Limbaugh, renowned for his trenchant political observations and playful sense of humor, weighed in on the controversy on his radio show, lending credence to the intrigue.\n\nAccording to the eagle-eyed patriots who first tipped the rest of us to the outrages perpetrated by the hand-signaling cabal, Clinton routinely rubbed her nose, plucked her eyebrows, picked baby kale from her teeth and otherwise blatantly gestured to Holt when she felt that Trump was making an especially cogent point. Holt would then cut off Trump mid-flow, or would lob a softball question to the Beast of Benghazi  er, Clinton  thus shifting the momentum back to the Democrat and away from the only legitimate mansplainer on the stage.\n\nNot content with sabotaging Trumps microphone and keeping him perpetually off-balance with questions tied to current events and grounded in historical fact, Holt and Private Server Sally  er, Clinton  were in cahoots throughout the night in a display of mainstream-media sycophancy the likes of which we havent seen since journalists around the country reported that the most recent (the fifth? sixth? seventh?) Benghazi investigation undertaken by Congress found no new evidence of culpability or wrongdoing by a Person of Interest in Vince Fosters Murder  er, Clinton.\n\nWith clear and present evidence of the lamestream medias bias now so glaringly revealed, we should all stay alert for any signs of similarly dexterous machinations in the next debate. Thus, some things to watch for on Oct. 9 in St. Louis:\n\n- If ABCs Martha Raddatz or CNNs Anderson Cooper blinks more than twice in one minute while looking at either candidate, or while looking away from either candidate, or while looking at his or her fellow moderator, one can be certain that, as Trump has repeatedly and eloquently cautioned over the past many months, theres something going on.\n\n- If the Little Rock She-Devil  er, former First Lady  mentions jobs, womens rights, childrens health, ISIS, the NRA, Wells Fargo, Vladimir Putin, politics, the Pope or her grandchildren  unprompted  its a lock that Raddatz or Cooper has managed to get to her, probably via finger taps or some sort of liberal telepathy. Or liberalepathy. (Thats a real thing. I think.)\n\n- If Trump again refuses, as is his right as a self-avowed Very Rich American Person, to explain why he will not release his personal tax returns, and if the Whitewater Harpie  er, two-term senator from New York  suggests that Trumps opacity in regard to his taxes is likely designed to cover the fact that he has never paid any federal taxes, or because he has not given away anything like the amount that he has always claimed hes donated to charities over the years, you can take it to the bank: Those earrings that Pneumonia Mary  er, the tireless fighter for 9/11 first responders  is wearing are not mere accessories. Theyre Bluetooth receivers wired directly into Debbie Wasserman Schultzs South Florida war room.\n\n- If no citizen participant in the town-hall style debate demands that the Wall Street Puppetess  er, longtime advocate for early childhood education  offer an explanation why she volunteered to defend a child rapist back in the 1970s, then its incontrovertible: Every person in that room was hand-picked by Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook, including the ushers, the lighting designers, and even Trumps hair architect. Or hairchitect. (That also is a real thing. Im pretty sure.)\n\n Finally, if the debate starts on time; remains decorous and civilized throughout the full 90 minutes; manages to illuminate real, substantive differences between the two candidates; and if the Sexual Pagan  er, Hillary Clinton  declares afterward that she resoundingly bested an unprepared, temperamentally unfit and occasionally unhinged Trump (yet again) in front of tens of millions of American voters, well, there you have it, folks: proof positive that the election process has been rigged since the start by the Leftist-Black Lives Matter-Zionist-Politically Correct-Kenyan Mafia-Vegan Thug-Socialist Healthcare-Ivory Tower-Elitist Egghead Industrial Complex.\n\nBut hey, theres always 2020 and the chance of a Cruz-Bachmann dream ticket.

According to the blog, on some occasions, after Clinton had touched her face, Holt helped her by attacking Trump or countering his statements.\n\nInfowars claimed the video shows Clinton making the first signal just before the taxes zinger.\n\nThe video evidence, according to YouTube conspiracy theorist No World Order, shows that Clinton signaled to Holt at least six times during the debate. She made long-drawn-out face scratching movements that indicated to the moderator that she wanted a chance to respond to Trumps comments or arguments.\n\nThis gave Clinton an advantage because it allowed her to interject with pre-planned zingers at opportune moments during the debate, according to conspiracy theorists.\n\nEvidence that Clinton and Holt were communicating secretly is clear from the fact that each time Clinton scratched her face, Holt intervened to her advantage, conspiracy theorists claimed.\n\nAnticipating skeptical reactions from viewers, the True Pundit blog claimed that it searched through videos of Clintons past speeches, campaign appearances, and even her 2008 debate performances and found that she practically never touches her face with her finger during public appearances.\n\nIn fact, she rarely touches her face at all, the blog declared.

According to the claim, immediately after the debate, as Clinton walked away, a man rushed to her podium and snatched all of the notes she used during the debate and took them to Holt (see video below).\n\nThe notes contained most likely all the questions and pre-planned answers to Holts questions, YouTube user Rusty TV claimed. It was a #RiggedDebate.\n\nBut online fact-checker Snopes dismissed the claims as baseless, insisting that the video does not show evidence that Clinton and Holt communicated via hand signals during the debate.\n\nThe creator of the video simply strung together several unrelated events  Clinton scratching her face, Holt making a comment and Clinton replying to Trump  and then claimed that they were somehow connected to a furtive signaling plot without providing any proof, Snopes argued.\n\nThe website also refuted claims that Clinton rarely touches her face with her fingers in public by publishing multiple photos showing Clinton touching her face in public.\n\nSnopes noted that Trump also touched his face multiple times during the debate.','2017-03-25 03:51:13'),(476,63,'72ec08f85c10026c82b8ccf4c61df421c20f204a64de736d38b8085b531144e8','2103eb27cf9341eea07c66db1bcf674b','','','A comprehensive video has surfaced that rather convincingly shows Hillary Clinton using hand signals like a third base baseball coach to prompt moderator Lester Holt to quickly call on her to counter comments by opponent Donald Trump during Mondays first Presidential Debate.\n\nThe video breaks down each one of Clintons movements which are followed by either Holt calling on her to comment and retort with what she believes is a zinger or Holt attacking Trumps dialogue.

It is simply ridiculous to claim that Clinton never once touched her face during a speech, campaign rally, or debate:\n\n\n\n It should be noted that Hillary Clinton was not the only one making these gestures during the first presidential debate:\n\nIt should also be noted that (as shown in the image at the head of this page) the two candidates were physically separated on the stage, and therefore in order to catch the supposed signals from Hillary Clinton, moderator Lester Holt  who didnt have the advantage of the split-screen shot presented to television viewers  would had to have been rather obviously watching her even when she was not speaking.\n\nIf Donald Trump truly dominated the early part of the debate but then lost his advantage, the more logical explanation is that his opponents strategy to throw him off his game simply worked as expected:\n\nThe quiet Mr. Trump took the first shift, presenting a general-election version of his forceful campaign persona minus the bluster, insults and defenses of his anatomy. He pushed his case firmly, hitting his campaigns focal points on the economy and trade. But it didnt take long for Mrs. Clinton to find the other Mr. Trump under that thin second skin. Her needling began immediately. She referred to her opponent as Donald, where he pointedly called her Secretary Clinton. (Yes, is that O.K.? he asked at his first reference to her.) She referred to his starting a business with a $14 million loan from his father, which Mr. Trump preferred to call a very small loan. The digs targeted Mr. Trumps status and founding mythos, triggering his image-protection reflex. He became combative and rattled, letting his opponent lead him down rhetorical detours (at one point he revived an old feud with Rosie ODonnell) knowing that he would follow his ingrained ABCs: always be counterpunching. It was Tony Soprano vs. Dr. Melfi, TVs biggest antihero blustering against the woman who had gotten inside his head.\n\nThis conspiracy theory also doesnt account for the much more obvious approach that if Hillary Clinton really wanted to say something during the course of the debate when it wasnt her turn to speak, she could simply have interrupted her opponent rather than invoking secret hand signals and waiting to be called upon by the moderator  as she did in fact do multiple times  while Donald Trump also did so, but three times as often.','2017-03-25 03:51:13'),(478,64,'7422e00db36ddb332244a669b167f3f9889d1aedb4cb0f6b10a5dcf8b4a00051','5abf5a35d6e241cca495dcef4482aa21','','','The nuclear deal clinched between Iran and six major world powers caps more than a decade of negotiations.

The U.S. and others believe war crimes are being committed as part of their campaign.\n\nThe three-way talks between Foreign Minister Javad Zarif and his Russian and Syrian counterparts were being held on Friday, and his ministry said he would be returning the same day.\n\nHis schedule beyond that has not been announced, but spokesman Bahram Qassemi said earlier it was too tight for him to travel to London to receive the award at a ceremony early next week.\n\nKerry will be going, however, to the ceremony to receive the Chatham House Prize, the State Department confirmed on Thursday. The trip will take him to Ireland on Sunday, and then on Monday to London, where he will receive the prize, hold talks on Libya, and meet with Londons first Muslim mayor, Sadiq Khan.\n\nAwarded by the Royal Institute of International Affairs (Chatham House), the prize is given to individuals or institutions deemed by the institute to have made the most significant contribution to improving international relations in the previous year.\n\nThis year it decided that Kerry and Zarif fit the bill, for their role in driving the negotiations that produced the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA).\n\nIt described the nuclear dispute one of the most intractable diplomatic standoffs in international affairs in the 21st century, and the negotiated agreement as one that many thought impossible.\n\nOvercoming enormous technical complexity, entrenched domestic opposition in the United States and Iran and three decades of intense hostility between their two countries, Kerry and Zarifs leadership and commitment, in particular, were imperative to sustaining and driving the negotiations to their successful conclusion, Chatham House said.\n\nThe prize is usually presented by the institutes patron, Queen Elizabeth, or senior royals on her behalf. Prevent recipients include Hillary Clinton (2013), Aung San Suu Kyi of Burma (2011) and Ukraines pro-Western President Viktor Yushchenko (2005).\n\nIn Washington, State Department spokesman John Kirby said Kerry was not seeking the award but was grateful and thankful that hes been selected for it.\n\nI think hed be the first to tell you that it was very much a team effort, involving others in the U.S. government such as Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz, as well as representatives of the other countries involved in the negotiations, Kirby said. (The P5+1 group comprised the U.S., Britain, France, Russia, China and Germany, and the European Union played a convening role.)\n\nBy contrast, Kirbys Iranian counterpart, Qassemi said Zarif views the award as one belonging to the Iranian nation for its resistance.\n\nDr. Zarif believes that the prize belongs to the great Iranian nation, who managed to overcome pressures and sanctions in recent years with their resistance and wisdom, he said.\n\nKerry evidently developed a close working relationship with Zarif during the marathon negotiations in Europe. The two have met numerous times and talk frequently talk on the phone.\n\nKerry has characterized Zarif as leaning moderate in a difficult and turbulent political environment.\n\nThere are people in Iran who want a different Iran, an Iran that reaches out to the world, an Iran thats engaged with people, an Iran that can re-enter the global community with respect and with acceptance, he said at a University of Chicago event on Wednesday, without naming Zarif.\n\nThere are those who are the hardliners who fight that every step of the way, Kerry added. They fought the nuclear agreement that we arrived at \n\nThe administration maintains that the JCPOA has made the world safer by removing the specter of a nuclear-armed Iran from a volatile region, even as the U.S. continues to have serious differences with Iran over its regional policies, sponsorship of terror, human rights record and ballistic missile activity.\n\nThe White House has also accused mostly Republican critics of the deal of being wildly misinformed or lying.\n\nCritics say an emboldened Iran, having benefited financially from the easing of sanctions entailed in the agreement, is behaving even more aggressively in the region.\n\nThey worry that the agreement, which allows Tehran to keep nuclear facilities and some infrastructure intact, will lead inevitably to a nuclear-capable Iran, pointing to JCPOA sunset clauses easing restrictions on the program after 10-15 years.\n\nRepublican presidential nominee Donald Trump at last months first presidential debate called it one of the worst deals ever made by any country in history.\n\nEarlier, Kerry and Zarif were rumored to be among nominees for the 2016 Nobel peace prize. It went to Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos for his efforts to end the long civil war in his country.','2017-03-25 03:51:13'),(481,64,'7422e00db36ddb332244a669b167f3f9889d1aedb4cb0f6b10a5dcf8b4a00051','2a8337fefcaf486a8978d02a5f287d6b','','','While Iran nuclear deal was undergoing intensively in 2014 and 2015, first guesses were shaped that a possible nuclear deal can bring those involved to the attention of Noble committee. Now, with almost a year and half after signing of the deal and with Oct. 6 around the corner, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif and US Secretary of State John Kerry are speculated by some media to be among candidates for the title of Nobel Peace Prize.\n\nIn fact the recent history of this prize shows interesting facts which strengthen the assessments that the committee chooses some nominees and laureates by political means and goals. While the history of peace prize sees names such as Martin Luther King, Mother Theresa, Lech Walesa and Nelson Mandela, on the other hand there are names that considering the title of the award being about peace might surprise one that how come such people have even been nominated for the award and let alone being the laureate!\n\nIn 1973, Henry Kissinger of the United States and Le Duc Tho of Vietnam were jointly named as winners. Le Duc Thos refusal to receive the award along with Kissinger can be telling enough how surprisingly political the award is. He had had long experience of fighting against great powers when he negotiated with Henry Kissinger for an armistice in Vietnam between 1969 and 1973. It was after the defeat of the French when Vietnam was divided. The USA supported its puppet government in South Vietnam. When the United States decided to negotiate after 1968, Le Duc Tho was appointed North Vietnam\'s chief negotiator, confronting Henry Kissinger.\n\nWhen Hanoi was bombed at Christmastime on Kissinger\'s orders, Le Duc Tho agreed to an armistice. But when he received the Peace Prize together with Kissinger in the autumn of 1973, he refused to accept it, as his opposite number had violated the truce. In other words, Noble committee had awarded Kissinger for his bombardment of Vietnam.\n\nOnly 5 years after U.S.-Vietnam award, another instance occurred when the award was given jointly to Egyptian President Mohamed Anwar al-Sadat and Prime Minister of Israeli regime Menachem Begin. The two received the award for signing The Camp David Accords. The agreement was the result of twelve days of secret negotiations at Camp David and was signed in White House with U.S. President Jimmy Carter witnessing it, in form of two frameworks. The first framework (A Framework for Peace in the Middle East), which dealt with the Palestinian territories, was written without participation of the Palestinians and was condemned by the United Nations.\n\n1978 Nobel Peace Award was given to two figures who had decided for occupation of Palestine and didnt even let the Palestinians know about it. An agreement which was opposed by the United Nations and was a treason by Sadat against the Muslim world. The second framework (A Framework for the Conclusion of a Peace Treaty between Egypt and Israel) led to the 1979 Egypt-Israel Peace Treaty. Anwar Sadats negotiations with Israeli regime was amid unanimous opposition of Muslim world and a betrayal to the war world of Islam had with a regime which had occupied Palestine. He had agreed to recognize the usurping regime and gave up Palestinian lands to liberate occupied lands in the Sinai. This betrayal was in fact the reason which led Khalid Islambouli to assassinate Sadat.\n\nSo the 1978 Nobel Peace Award was given to two figures who had decided for occupation of Palestine and didnt even let the Palestinians know about it. An agreement which was opposed by the United Nations and was a treason by Sadat against the Muslim world.\n\nNotably enough, Jimmy Carter similarly won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2002.\n\nWhile the 1978 prize had hailed the two winners for so-called contribution to peace, it was just a matter of time to prove that neither the agreement and efforts for which they were awarded, nor the selection of the committee were correct. The Nobel Peace Prize 1994 was awarded jointly to Yasser Arafat, Shimon Peres and Yitzhak Rabin, Again, \"for their efforts to create peace in the Middle East.\"\n\nShimon Peres was no peacemaker. Ill never forget the sight of pouring blood and burning bodies at Qana, this is how Robert Fisk describes former Israeli regime president Peres in the Independent after his death last week. Only two years after he was awarded the prize, Peres ordered a heinous massacre in Qana village within an attack on a UN refugee camp killing 106 civilians almost half of them children and burning and injuring 116 more unarmed, defenseless people.\n\nRobert Fisk who has been outside the camp at the time of attack recounts the bittering event; when the world heard that Shimon Peres had died, it shouted Peacemaker! But when I heard that Peres was dead, I thought of blood and fire and slaughter. I saw the results: babies torn apart, shrieking refugees, smoldering bodies. It was a place called Qana and most of the 106 bodies  half of them children  now lie beneath the UN camp where they were torn to pieces by Israeli shells in 1996. I had been on a UN aid convoy just outside the south Lebanese village. Those shells swished right over our heads and into the refugees packed below us. It lasted for 17 minutes.\n\nThough Peres claimed that it was a bitter surprise that the camp was filled by several hundred people, while as Fisk has put it It was a lie. The Israelis had occupied Qana for years after their 1982 invasion, they had video film of the camp, they were even flying a drone over the camp during the 1996 massacre  a fact they denied until a UN soldier gave me his video of the drone, frames from which we published in The Independent. The UN had repeatedly told Israel that the camp was packed with refugees.\n\nIt is a fact that a Nobel Peace Prize laureate who has been remembered as peacemaker since his death last week, was the main person responsible for massacre of innocent people in Qana. And it is of course noteworthy that the Palestinian figure who shared the award with him  Yasser Arafat  was reportedly assassinated with poison by the Israeli regime, a matter which is under investigation.\n\nBarack Obama, the 44th President of the United States, was awarded the peace prize for his extraordinary efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and cooperation between peoples, while he had been in power for less than eight months when he was picked for the title. Among reasons the Noble committee had considered as factors for Obama being the winner was his support for the vision of a world free from nuclear weapons and his advocacy for dialogue and cooperation across national, ethnic, religious and political dividing lines. They also believed that Obama had improved relations of Muslim world and the West.\n\nAccording to the Nobel staff, he had done all of these things within only 8 months in office! From the abovementioned issues, he had only delivered a speech in Cairo talking about better relations between Muslims and the West. In other words, the award was given to the lip service he had paid so far without any deeds!\n\nBut with the experience of 1994, it is good to have a look at President Obamas foreign policy as his term is coming to an end. His Secretary of State and currently presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton admits in her book that the Obama administration and she had supported regime change and welcomed the coup in Honduras which ousted democratically elected Manuel Zelaya in 2009.\n\nShe has also admitted that under her term in office, the United States supported formation of extremist groups in the Middle East and it led to the events in Libyas Benghazi and of course formation of Daesh or ISIL. In 2015, Former Director of Defense Intelligence Agency Michael Flynn announced that Americans willfully allowed ISIL and Al-Nusra rise in Syria and Iraq to weaken Bashar Assad in Syria. It was also announced in secret documents revealed by sources in the United States.\n\nIn Ukraine, U.S. supported another regime change by the means of its so-called democracy promoting programs by funding NGOs and groups in the country to rig the election as it was done before within color revolutions in that part of the world. Obama and his men didnt even accept a referendum in Crimea in which majority of people vote for being part of Russia.\n\nAnother instance of such interventions into domestic affairs of other countries can be widely seen in the Middle East where under the umbrella of NED and USAID program, Washington spent millions of dollars to provoke social movements, especially after the chain of unrests and revolutions in the region. The protests which ousted democratically elected President Morsi in Egypt were according to studies led by a number of activists and NGOs funded directly by National Endowment for Democracy. The same NGOs part of whom were arrested in 2011 and the assets of some of them were frozen a couple of weeks ago.\n\nSudan was another scene in Africa where Obama administration pursued their agenda to divide the country into two parts the result of which is now turned to be poverty and economic and political problems in the two parts of the same country.\n\nBarack Obama who was hailed for his words about a world free from nuclear weapons is now seeking plans to renovate nuclear weapons of the United States and continues to support the Israeli regime, Pakistan and India who are not signatories to NPT and have stockpiled nuclear warheads. Meanwhile, as he is supposed to be an advocate of dialogue and cooperation between different religious groups, his administration has hit the highest record of arms sale to Saudi Arabia  $115 billion. While Riyadh is the safe haven of many extremist and terrorist groups and it is no secret now that Wahhabi ideology of Saudis is the root cause of extremism and terrorism carried out across the world in name of Islam and the country has long been sowing discord among Islamic sects. It was just last month when a conference in Grozny gathering all Sunni groups and sects excluded Wahhabism from Sunni beliefs and never invited anyone from this ideology to the massive event where many scholars and figures were invited and Al-Azhar figures participated too.\n\nNow with the possibility of an award for U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, it would be no surprise if the committee picks Kerry in another political move to provide Obama administration and John Kerry with a legacy at the end of their term in office.\n\nIt is however possible to see Kerry hailed for contributing to global peace, even if John Kerry has been representing terrorist groups in Syria and even if his negotiations led to a direct U.S. attack on Syrian government forces in Deir Ezzor. It is however possible to see Kerry hailed for contributing to global peace, even if John Kerry has been representing terrorist groups in Syria and even if his negotiations led to a direct U.S. attack on Syrian government forces in Deir Ezzor; and even if he and his country are supporting armed groups who are officially affiliated with Al-Qaeda which is by the U.S. and U.N. considered as terrorist group; he can be winner even if he has supported Saudi-led invasion of Yemen which has killed thousands of innocent people, many of them women and children.\n\nThe truth is that even in case of Irans nuclear deal for which Zarif and Kerry are expected to be shortlisted for an award, like the case in 1973, only one part of it deserves the award and the American side has not fulfilled its commitments in the deal and no real outcome has occurred as the United States is politically barring the JCPOA from going forward.\n\nSo there is no wonder if John Kerry is added to the list of many politicized picks of the Nobel committee and FMs of a country like U.S. which has the darkest history of attacking other countries and a country like Iran which has never attacked or interfered into affairs of other countries for at least a century, go hand in hand to receive an award for peace!\n\nHamid Reza Gholamzadeh has done his MA in North American Studies and his focus has been on US policies towards the Middle East.

Carl Bildt, the former Swedish prime minister, tweeted happily:\n\nThe Vienna deal is a capitulation to one of the worst regimes on earth. Far from requiring the Iranians to dismantle their illicit nuclear program, the accord leaves almost all of it intact. In exchange for little more than a promise to delay its development of nuclear warheads, Tehran is rewarded with $150 billion in sanctions relief and, within a few years, the lifting of the UN embargo on conventional weapons and missile sales. The Islamic Republic is the worlds foremost state sponsor of terrorism, yet nothing in the agreement requires any change in its notorious behavior. And despite the regimes long record of treaty violations and deceit, the deal enables it to stall for almost a month before complying with a demand for access by inspectors  hardly the anytime, anywhere, 24/7 inspections that the Obama administration had claimed it would insist on.\n\nThe White House wanted to sign a deal; Irans rulers wanted to ensure their path to the bomb and nuclear legitimacy. Both got what they wanted. The consequences will be a nuclear arms race in the Middle East, more Iranian terrorism and subversion, and a greater likelihood of war.\n\nIt wouldnt be the first time.\n\nThe Obama/Kerry willingness to concede anything for a nuclear deal with Iran has been likened to Neville Chamberlains infamous Munich agreement with Adolf Hitler in 1938. Then, too, shameless capitulation was hailed as a triumph of peacemaking and diplomacy. Chamberlain was cheered as a hero in the press and on the street, and he won a resounding vote of confidence in Parliament. He was widely nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize, including by a dozen members of the Swedish parliament. Who knows  he might have received it, had Hitler waited just a little longer before invading Czechoslovakia.\n\nAll too often the Nobel Committee has seen fit to bestow its prestigious honor on men who negotiated peace accords that ended up undermining peace. In 1973, the prize was awarded to Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and North Vietnams Le Duc Tho, lead negotiators of the Paris Peace Accords that purported to end the Vietnam War. In reality, the accords paved the way for US withdrawal, effectively abandoning South Vietnam to defeat and brutal occupation by the communist North.\n\nThe Locarno Treaties of 1925, now largely forgotten, settled Germanys borders with Western Europe, and were extravagantly portrayed as guaranteeing that Germany would never again violate the peace. France and Germany Ban War Forever, cheered The New York Times, and the Nobel Committee, intoxicated with the spirit of Locarno, awarded peace prizes to the French, British, and German foreign ministers who negotiated the deal. Yet the treaties deliberately left Germanys eastern borders open to revision. In essence, one Polish leader remarked bitterly, Germany was officially asked to attack the east, in return for peace in the west. The promised peace was a mere bubble. The war Locarno facilitated would prove all too bloodily real.\n\nThe Nobel Peace Prize for the Oslo Accords  presented in 1994 to Yasser Arafat, Yitzhak Rabin, and Shimon Peres  was another blunder that looks even worse in retrospect. A peace prize for Arafat, an arch-terrorist and hatemonger who devoted his life to the destruction of peace? It was as contemptible a choice as the Nobel Committee has ever made. Of course, theres always next year.\n\nJeff Jacoby can be reached at jacoby@globe.com.

Barack Obama\'s name heads the list although he probably is disqualified by the Committee\'s premature, unjustified award back in 2009. Attention, therefore, is focused on Secretary Kerry and Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif. Their sharing of the prize could be seen as a neat way to honor the achievement without judging who exactly is most responsible for it. There is precedent -- let us recall how Oslo decided to pair Anwar Sadat with Menachem Begin in 1978, and then Yasser Arafat, Yitzhak Rabin and Shimon Peres in 1994.\n\nNow, in a sense, we are facing a similar situation. Here is why. There are a number of premises that underlie the judgment that the nuclear agreement is a monumental accomplishment in the cause of peace. Yet, they in fact are all of dubious validity. They can be boiled down to these propositions:\n\n1. Iran had a strong interest in building a bomb and was acquiring the capability to do.\n\n2. Its motives were suspect because it had engaged in some activities that were not reported to the IAEA as it was required to do under terms of the Non-Proliferation Treaty to which it is a signatory\n\n3. This was the basis for judging the matter to be an \"existential\" threat to Middle East peace and stability\n\n4. Military hostilities could have occurred unless this concern was alleviated.\n\n5. Hostilities could have been by the United States and/or Israel who perceived Iran to be a threat to them.\n\n6. Iran could have responded by initiating military action in retaliation against them or against 3rd parties\n\n7. Therefore, an accord on terms that settled the issue between the United States and Iran (but not Israel) was a significant step away from war and toward peace.\n\n8. Obama demonstrated uncommon courage and political skill in overcoming strong resistance to the agreement in Congress\n\n1.The Islamic Republic of Iran never has had a dedicated nuclear weapons program. Whatever research activities it engaged in that could be relevant to such a program ceased in 2003 -- as confirmed by the exhaustive report of the Office of National Intelligence in 2007 and reconfirmed on a number of occasions since. We should bear in mind the significance of that date not because the American invasion of Iraq struck fear in the hearts of the regime\'s leaders, but rather because it eliminated their mortal enemy Saddam Hussein whose attack in 1980 (later aided by the United States) started a bloody seven year war and whose own interest in WMD was revealed by inspections that followed in the wake of his defeat in the 1991 Gulf War.\n\nMuch of the confusion about Iranian capabilities and intentions derives from the objective reality that a wide range of peaceful nuclear program permitted under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty have potential military applications. The enrichment of uranium is foremost among them. Therefore, Iranian interest in mastering those technologies does not represent either violation of the NPT nor should be taken as a sign of commitment to development of an atomic weapon. Iran\'s \'sin\' - which has been the trigger for the entire skein of indictments and penalties - was the failure to report the opening of one facility to the International Atomic Energy Commission the operation of one particular facility.\n\n2.The foremost \"threat\" presented by Iran in the minds of American and Israeli leaders has not been the prospect of nuclear armaments per se. Instead, it has been Iran\'s emergence as a Middle Eastern power challenging the dominance of the United States and its allies. The remote possibility of its acquiring a nuclear capability surely heightened their level of concern. However, that core concern was independent of the nuclear issue. The issue did serve the strategic purpose of providing justification for isolating the IRI economically and politically, particularly the imposition of crippling sanctions.\n\n3.Further evidence of that proposition is provided in abundance by the hardline position of the Obama administration in rejecting out-of-hand any suggestion of a normalization of relations between Washington and Teheran. This is despite the obvious convergence of interest in confronting the rise if ISIL. While rejecting even tactical cooperation on this and other regional problems, the United States has pursued a relentless propaganda campaign that castigates Iran as the instigator of conflicts throughout the region, e.g. Yemen, Syria, Lebanon despite their having multiple causes among which Iranian actions are not primary.\n\n4-6. Military conflict over the Iranian nuclear issue during the long standoff could take only one form -- American and/or Israeli airstrikes against Iranian nuclear facilities. Both countries threatened such: the Israelis explicitly and repeatedly; the United States obliquely. Otherwise, this was a crisis which, in and of itself, did not involve hostilities nor necessarily would provoke them. Iran, certainly, had no reason or intention of doing so.\n\nIt is true that Iran might have retaliated to an air assault by a number of military actions: attacking American bases elsewhere in the region; attacking shipping in the Persian Gulf; or launching missiles against Israel. Avoiding that scenario is by definition a contribution to peace; the means of avoidance, though, was to refrain from the initial aggressive military action in the first place.\n\nThen there is the question of whether the hypothetical Iranian acquisition of a nuclear weapons capability (demonstrated or not) constituted such a singular threat to international peace that the United States and its allies were justified in declaring that eventuality as being so dire as to warrant resort to all means to prevent it. If so, then logically it follows that the coercive diplomacy they pursued could be considered to be an act in the cause of peace,\n\nTo accept this proposition, we must make the assumption that a hypothetical Iranian nuclear capability at some point in the future constituted a magnitude of threat much greater than that posed by extant nuclear powers. They number nine: the United States, Russia, Britain, France, China, India, Pakistan, North Korean and Israel. In addition, South Africa at one time possessed nuclear weapons (as was known to Western intelligence). It is debatable at least that a conjectured nuclear Iran in fact would have been in a threat category of its own compared to North Korea and Israel.\n\n7. Based on the above assessment, there is sound reason to question whether the Iran nuclear accord represents a truly outstanding contribution to peace. Moreover, there are side-effects that point in quite the opposite direction. We should weigh in the balance the following: the spike in American sales of advanced weapons to Israel, Saudi Arabia and the Gulf principalities; American complicity in the Saudi led assault on Yemen (motivated by a Washington approved Saudi desire to counter what it claims is Iranian/Shi\'ite influence among the Houthis) which has produced enormous destruction and loss of life; the resulting strengthening of the Yemen based al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsular; and moves to enter into tacit understanding with the al-Qaeda Syrian affiliate al-Nusra also to counter Iranian influence as manifest in its backing of the Assad regime. Together, this set of American policies also fuels a sectarian conflict between Sunnis and Shi\'ites that is setting ablaze the entire region.\n\nAll of these actions, and consequences, flow directly from Washington\'s judgment that they were imperative to offset the nuclear accord with Iran by currying favor with Israel, Saudi Arabia and the minor Gulf states. It is hard to see why the resulting Yemeni and Palestinian lives destroyed should whether so lightly in the ethical balance -- and why most ignore them completely -- when considering the award of a Nobel Peace Prize.\n\n8. There most certainly unprecedented opposition to the nuclear agreement from Congress (especially the unified bloc of Republicans) and the pro-Israel lobby. Well-funded, highly organized and backed by an orchestrated lobbying campaign in the media, these \"contras\" came within a few votes of forcing a Presidential veto and not many more from passing a resolution of rejection. We should bear in mind, though, that much of this fierce resistance was of Obama\'s own doing. First, he and his administration had contributed mightily to the depiction of the Islamic Republic of Iran as a regime beyond the pale to whom the standard measures of threat assessment didn\'t apply. For six years, there was the steady chorus of denunciation. Washington reciprocated Iran\'s hostility with stigmatized the Islamic Republic as inherently Evil, an existential menace, and therefore a government that had best disappear (\"Death to the IRI.\" This added to an atmosphere of fright which skewed consideration of all matters Iranian.\n\nSecond, Obama\'s passivity in the face of his humiliation by Bibi Netanyahu, in cahoots with the Republican leadership, emboldened both to take radical measures never before seen = and, in the process, aggravated fears and anxieties.\n\nObama\'s rhetoric between the signing of the nuclear accord and the Congressional votes was bellicose and uncompromising to the extent that it heightened concerns - real or confected - that even this strict set of restrictions did not suffice as iron clad guarantees against Iranian nuclear ambitions in the future.\n\nIn summary, there are substantial grounds for distancing oneself from the facile, widespread assessment that the Nobel Peace Prize should be awarded to those who negotiated nuclear deal. The Iranian leadership, which had their own reasons for desiring an agreement, understandably may well have decided that those conditions -- qualifying the country\'s national sovereignty as never before done short of total defeat in war -- were intolerably onerous. Instead, they reached the judgment that their national interests were better served by accepting the accord. It is not self-evident that Obama, or the U.S. government in general, did anything exceptional to encourage them to make that choice. Ritual denunciations of the IRI and its intentions were the order of the day. Washington set and maintained an extraordinary harsh set of conditions to the very end. A less eager leadership in Teheran might never have conceded the highly dubious and unprecedented demands of the Americans. Most important in this regard, Iran in fact they had no nuclear weapons program to abandon and by all appearances did not even consider one after 2003. Hence, they had little to lose.\n\nIt follows that the \"problem\" itself was freighted with exaggerated importance. As noted above, we witnessed an orchestrated campaign to demonize the IRI for reasons having no direct connection to their nuclear activities. In a sense, the celebration is for resolving a pseudo-crisis created to a large extent by the behavior of those who preen as peace-makers.\n\nThere is additional consideration to take into account. The Nobel Peace Prize is awarded to persons; therefore, the prospective awardees\' worthiness cannot be assessed exclusively in regard to one accomplishment. This is particularly so when he has been involved in several diplomatic actions simultaneously. In regard to Secretary Kerry, let us keep in mind that he directed American foreign policy when Washington gave the green light to the Israeli government\'s indiscriminate killing of Palestinian civilians in Operation Protective Edge -- and when the United States continued to prosecute a pointless war in Afghanistan that involved the notorious drone \'signature\' strikes.\n\nAs stipulated in Alfred Nobel\'s will, the prize should go to \"who shall have done the most or the best work for fraternity between nations, for the abolition or reduction of standing armies and for the holding and promotion of peace congresses.\"\n\nTo award the Nobel Peace Prize to Obama or Kerry would be an offense to the truth unmatched since the prize was given to Henry Kissinger and Le Duc Tho. By the way, the Nobel Committee also managed to overlook Mahatma Gandhi -- determining in 1948, the year after his death, that there was no one deserving of the prize.','2017-03-25 03:51:13'),(484,64,'7422e00db36ddb332244a669b167f3f9889d1aedb4cb0f6b10a5dcf8b4a00051','67148f3c52fd45c6aa6e0db55e3dbe5c','','','You start out in 1954 by saying, Nigger, nigger, nigger.

The Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), known commonly as the Iran Deal, aims to restrict uranium enrichment for 15 years, cut the stockpile of low-enriched uranium by 98%, reduce the number of gas centrifuges by two-thirds over a 13 year period and opens all such facilities to monitors within the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).

That year, the thrice-divorced Austin housekeeper married her 75-year-old millionaire employer, Steven Beard. Suddenly, Celeste had it all: a Texas mansion, plenty of money, and a stable life for her two daughters. But on October 2, 1999, Celeste\'s picture-perfect life came crashing down with one blast from a 20-guage shotgun. That night, an armed intruder slipped into Steven\'s bedroom and fired a point-blank shot directly into his chest. Steven survived the initial shot, but five months later, died from complications related to his injury. By then, however, Texas authorities had a suspect in custody--Celeste\'s lesbian best friend, Tracey Tarlton. The former bookstore manager eventually implicated Celeste in the plot to kill her husband. At the trial, defense attorneys alleged Tarlton was simply a jealous woman with a terrifying and deadly love interest in Celeste. Prosecutors, on the other hand, claimed the Celeste had manipulated her fiend into perpetrating the shooting in order to inherit Steven\'s vast fortune. To support their claim, prosecutors even called Celeste\'s own daughters to the stand. Both girls testified that their mother had sought a hit man to silence Tracey before her arrest. The jury found Celeste guilty of conspiracy to commit murder and sentenced her to 20 years in prison.Virginia Larzelere was well off, even by coastal Florida\'s relatively high standards. Her husband Norman was a successful Daytona Beach dentist, and Virginia enjoyed a beautiful home, expensive cars, a yacht and an airplane. But the good times came to an abrupt end on March 8, 1991, when a masked gunman broke into Norman\'s office and killed him with a shotgun blast to the chest. In the murder investigation that ensued, police quickly discovered that the Larzelere family was anything but ordinary. It appeared that the couple financed their lavish lifestyle by funneling narcotics through Norman\'s dental practice, and both engaged in numerous extramarital affairs. Digging deeper, the cops also uncovered a two-million dollar life insurance policy that Virginia had taken out on her husband. Then, the Larzelere\'s live-in help, Steve Heidel, came forward with the exact location of the murder weapon. Heidel told police that Virginia and her son, Jason, had asked him to dispose of the weapon following the shooting. On May 5, 1991, both Virginia and Jason were charged with first-degree murder in the death of Norman Larzelere. At her trial, prosecutors described Virginia as an opportunist looking to cash in on her husband\'s hefty life insurance policy. The defense, however, argued that Steve Heidel was the actual mastermind behind the murder. In the end, the jury sided with prosecutors and sentenced Virginia to death. In a separate trial seven months later, Jason Larzelere was acquitted on all charges.Few smiles were brighter than those of Clara and David Harris. Both dentists, they shared a thriving practice and a seemingly perfect marriage. But that changed in July of 2003, when Clara began to suspect her husband was having an affair with his secretary. Intent on catching them in the act, Clara hired a private detective to tail the couple around town. A few days later, the detective called Clara to tell her that he had followed David and his secretary to a hotel rendezvous - the same hotel that Clara and David had been married in. Enraged over the news, Clara grabbed her stepdaughter and drove to the hotel to confront David. When Clara saw him exit the building, she gunned her Mercedes and ran over him - several times. At her trial, Clara\'s attorneys said she had been pushed to the limit by her difficult-to-please husband. According to the defense, Clara had quit her practice, hired a personal trainer and undergone plastic surgery in an effort to make David happy. But the jury showed her little sympathy, especially after watching a videotape of the vehicular homicide that had been taped by, ironically, the detective Clara had hired to tail David. Convicted of 2nd degree murder, she\'s currently serving a 20-year sentence.Russian migr Elena Kiejliches was living the American dream. At 36, she had two beautiful children, a millionaire husband, and a sprawling mansion in Staten Island\'s upscale Toldt Hill neighborhood. But Elena\'s fairytale life came crashing down in March of 2000, when her husband, Borys, went missing. A month later, Borys turned back up - dead and dismembered in a cardboard barrel found floating in a marsh in Queens. Police first suspected the Russian mob in Borys\' death. But the focus of their investigation soon shifted to Elena after they learned she had been having an affair with a man named Messiah Justice, an aspiring rapper and con artist. Following an interrogation with Justice, police charged the Russian housewife with murder. At trial, Justice testified that he had helped Elena dispose of Borys\' body, but that the Russian housewife had pulled the trigger herself. The prosecution contended that Elena had shot Borys after he had threatened to divorce her and leave her destitute. The defense, however, painted Justice as an opportunist looking to cut a deal with the DA. The jury found Elena guilty of second-degree murder. She was sentenced to 22 years to life in prison.A bright and bubbly surgical technician, Kim Hricko led a comfortable middle-class existence with her husband, Steven. But the Hricko\'s sunny, suburban image vanished in smoke and flame on Valentine\'s weekend of 1998 when Steve and Kim went on a romantic getaway at a golf resort on Maryland\'s Eastern Shore. As part of the special Valentine\'s package, the resort staged a murder mystery play where guests watched the staged whodunit and then attempted to solve the puzzle. But after the play, the plot thickened when the couple\'s room caught fire and Stephen\'s charred body was discovered on the hotel room floor. Though Kim claimed her husband had gotten drunk and died from smoke inhalation, the resulting autopsy showed no signs of either alcohol or carbon monoxide anywhere in his body. At Kim\'s trial, the prosecution argued that she had knocked Stephen out with Succinylcholine - a nearly untraceable muscle paralyzer used in surgery - in order to collect on his $400,000 life insurance policy. Found guilty on both charges, she\'s currently serving life plus 30 years for arson and murder.Lee Ann Reidel always had a thing for hunky men. So when she married Long Island gym owner Paul Reidel in 1998, everyone thought it was the perfect match. Lee Ann just had one small problem with her new husband - his crack cocaine addiction. In July of 2000, Lee Ann took the couple\'s infant son and moved in with her mom in Florida. After being separated for six months, the couple reconciled when Paul agreed to go into rehab. But just when things were starting to look up for the Reidel family, tragedy struck. On January 17, 2001, a gunman shot someone fitting Paul\'s description outside his gym in Long Island. When the police arrived at the scene, it wasn\'t Paul that lay dead on the asphalt, it was his partner and best friend, Alex Algeri. Detectives made their first break in the case when they arrested a drug-abusing bodybuilder named Scott Pagett. In his interrogation, Pagett fingered a Florida strip-club bouncer named Ralph \"Rocco\" Salierno as the actual triggerman. Pressing Pagett more, investigators discovered that Rocco and Lee Ann were having an affair. With the information in hand, authorities immediately charged the two for the murder of Alex Algeri. At their trial, prosecutors alleged that Algeri was the unintended victim of a scheme to murder Paul Reidel for his insurance money. Though Lee Ann and Rocco each tried to pin the murder on each other, the jury found them both guilty and sentenced the former lovers to life in prison.Ruthann Aron was an overachiever. The wife of a respected urologist in the upscale D.C. suburb of Potomac, Maryland, Ruthann was a successful real estate developer and aspiring politician. In 1994, she made a run to be the Republican nominee for the U.S. Senate, but lost, partly due to a local attorney who dogged the campaign with allegations of shady business deals. Ruthann, however, was undeterred. In 1997, she was gearing up to run for a Montgomery County commission seat. But her political ambitions were thwarted yet again when a local landfill operator went to the police claiming she\'d approached him about finding a hit man. After an elaborate sting operation, Ruthann was arrested for soliciting the murders of, not just her old political nemesis, but her husband as well. At trial, prosecutors claimed Ruthann feared her marriage was heading for a divorce, which might hurt her political career. In addition to the testimony of the landfill operator and the undercover cops, the prosecution had Ruthann\'s own voice on surveillance tapes literally spelling out the names of her intended victims. Faced with overwhelming evidence, Ruthann\'s attorneys argued that Ruthann was mentally ill. The trial resulted in a hung jury. Ruthann then pled no contest and served three years in the county jail.24-year-old Joyce Cohen went from rags to riches when she met and married Miami construction millionaire Stan Cohen in 1981. Together, the couple lived lavishly in an exclusive Coconut Grove mansion, went skiing at their Steamboat Springs ranch, and partied all night long at Stan\'s Miami nightclub. But Joyce\'s party came to an abrupt end on March 7, 1986, when she frantically called 911 claiming that Stan had been murdered by three intruders that had broken into their mansion. To cops, the story seemed plausible. At the time, Miami was plagued with home invasion robberies and, like many Miami real estate developers in the 1980s, there were rumors that Stan was involved with some shady characters. But when a convicted felon already serving jail time came forward with information that Joyce had hired him and his friends to do Stan in, cops swept in and arrested her. At trial, prosecutors painted Joyce as a gold-digging murderess who killed Stan after he had threatened divorce. Faced with losing the luxurious life-style she had grown accustomed to, Joyce had plotted her husband\'s murder with three men she had met on the Miami club scene. The jury found her guilty of murder but was unable to reach a unanimous decision at her sentencing. With the jury deadlocked, the judge sentenced her to 25 years to life. Joyce will be eligible for parole in 2014.To everyone who knew her, Susan Wright seemed like she had everything. Married to successful salesman Jeff Wright, she was a stay-at-home mom raising two adorable young children in their suburban Houston home. But, then, in January of 2003, Jeff mysteriously disappeared. Susan told others that Jeff had walked out after striking their five-year-old son. But, one of Jeff\'s co-workers became suspicious and called the cops. With police closing in, Susan eventually told local authorities that she had killed Jeff - in self-defense - and buried his body in the backyard. At her trial, the prosecution claimed Susan had killed Jeff not in self-defense, but for insurance money. Her lawyers, on the other hand, painted Jeff as an abusive husband and claimed that Susan killed him after he attacked her with a knife. But there were plenty of holes in Susan\'s story; 192 to be exact. That\'s how many times Susan had stabbed Jeff in \"self-defense.\" The jury convicted Susan of first-degree murder and sentenced her to 25 years in prison.Diane Zamora and her fianc, David Graham, had a bright future ahead of them. High school sweethearts, the couple had met in 1991 as volunteers in the Texas Civil Air Patrol. She was an honor roll student bound for Annapolis, and he was a track star with an appointment to the Air Force Academy. But their ambitions to serve their country were derailed on December 4th, 1995, when a farmer discovered the battered body of Adrianne Jones, a sophomore member of David\'s high school track team, laying in a field. Brutally beaten, she had been shot in the head. After nine months of dead ends, investigators got a tip from one of Diane\'s Annapolis classmates. According to the informant, Diane had admitted that she and David had murdered Adrianne after David had confessed that he\'d had sex with the girl. In September of 1996, both Zamora and Graham were arrested for the murder. Given separate trials, the young lovers turned on each other and said that the killing had been the other\'s idea. Neither defense worked. Both were found guilty and given life sentences.Blond, spunky, and ambitious, Kristin Rossum seemed to be going places. A summa cum laude graduate of San Diego State University, she worked as a toxicologist at the San Diego medical examiner\'s office. Her husband, Greg, worked for an up-and-coming biotech firm. Well-educated, highly intelligent, and good-looking, their future seemed limitless. But Kristin\'s picture-perfect life came to an end on November 6, 2000, when she returned home from work and found Greg dead of an apparent suicide, his body covered in rose petals. At autopsy, police discovered Greg had died from an overdose of the drug, Fentanyl. Fentanyl, cops soon found out, was a drug Kristin had a lot of contact with at her toxicology job. When police learned that a large amount of the drug had been reported missing from the lab where Kristin worked, they hauled her in for Greg\'s murder. At her trial, prosecutors said that Kristin had poisoned Greg with the drug and then covered his body with rose petals mimicking a scene from her favorite movie, \"American Beauty\" in an effort to make the cops believe the death was a suicide. As for motive, prosecutors asserted that Kristin had developed a secret addiction to crystal methamphetamine. When Greg threatened to expose Kristin\'s drug habits, she plotted his death with a co-worker she\'d been having an affair with. Portrayed as a lying and manipulative druggie, the jury found Kristin guilty of Greg\'s murder and sentenced her to life in prison.By most accounts, Debra Baker had the perfect job. She was the bookkeeper and business manager of Jerry Sternadel, a millionaire Texan entrepreneur. She was also a close confidant of Sternadel\'s wife, Lou Ann. They were so close that many, including Lou Ann\'s husband, began to suspect that the pair were more than just friends. In 1990, Jerry fell deathly ill. As he lay in his hospital bed, he told anyone who would listen that he thought Debra and Lou Ann had poisoned him. He died shortly afterward. A follow-up autopsy revealed that Jerry had ingested a lethal dose of arsenic. When a trace of the poison was found in a storage shed rented to Debra, she was immediately arrested and charged with Jerry\'s murder. At trial, prosecutors painted a picture not of a love triangle, but of a hate triangle. Jerry hated his wife and wanted to divorce her. Debra hated her boss. And Lou Ann hated the thought of losing her lavish lifestyle. Prosecutors argued that Debra had poisoned Jerry before he could divorce her beloved friend, Lou Ann. Based on the evidence of the arsenic found in Debra\'s storage shed, the jury found her guilty of murder. But in a surprising legal twist, the same jury that had convicted her sentenced her to only10-years probation and fined her $10,000. In 2003, Debra Baker was arrested for parole violations. She was sentenced to 10 years in prison.The daughter of a wealthy Michigan businessman, Carolyn Warmus enjoyed a life of privilege that included a swanky apartment on New York\'s Upper East Side and an all-expenses-paid education at exclusive Columbia University. After earning a Masters degree in elementary education, Carolyn landed a job teaching computer science at Greenville Elementary in Scarsdale, New York. There, she met and began dating a popular sixth grade teacher named Paul Solomon. Paul, however, just happened to be a married man. Their torrid affair continued until Paul made a gruesome discovery on the evening of January 15, 1989. That day, he found his wife, Betty Jean, shot to death in the couple\'s condo. The focus of the subsequent investigation quickly centered on Paul\'s obsessed lover, Carolyn Warmus. Sorting through Carolyn\'s phone records, investigators discovered that the blond bombshell had made a few calls to a P.I. named Vinnie Parco. Parco admitted to police that he had sold Carolyn a .25-caliber automatic - the exact weapon used to kill Betty Jean Solomon. There was also evidence that Carolyn had purchased ammunition from a New Jersey gun dealer on the exact day of the murder. Though it took two trials, Carolyn Warmus was eventually found guilty of murder and sentenced to 25 years to life in prison.Adele and Steven Craven were the perfect suburban couple. Adele was a trained mortician; Steven was a high-flying Delta Airlines pilot with a sky-high salary. They had a beautiful home in upscale Covington, Kentucky; their two young sons loved their school; and Steven could reach the Delta hub at Cincinnati in minutes. Being close to the airport was also convenient for Adele. Unbeknownst to Steven, she was having an affair with Delta baggage handler Rusty McIntyre. But the lovers needed more space-the cops had already caught them having sex in a car in a church parking lot-and they wanted Steven\'s $500,000 life insurance payoff. So Adele got Rusty to hire a hit man. For $15,000, small-time crook Ronald Pryor agreed to bludgeon Steven to death with a crow bar. On the morning of July 12, 2000, the three attacked Steven in the Craven\'s basement. When twelve blows of the crow bar didn\'t kill her husband, Adele gave Pryor a loaded pistol to finish the job. Within days, all three were arrested and charged with murder. Tried together in June 2001, McIntyre and Pryor were convicted of murder and sentenced to death. Adele cried at her trial in November 2002, swearing she was innocent and dearly loved Steven, a good man and a good father. Steven\'s murder was McIntyre\'s idea, she said. He stalked her, spied on her, seduced her, and when she tried to break up, he hired Pryor to kill her husband. To escape the death penalty, McIntyre turned State\'s witness, but Pryor refused to testify. The jury couldn\'t decide who to believe and on December 6 the judge declared a mistrial. In a second trial scheduled to begin in January 2004, both McIntyre and Pryor agreed to testify against Adele. Feeling the noose tighten around her neck, she pleaded guilty to masterminding the murder-for-hire plot. She received a life sentence without the possibility of parole for twenty years. All three are currently serving time in the Kentucky prison system.When a long-suffering wife shoots an intruder in the dark and he turns out to be her no-count husband, the cops suspect it\'s murder.

Then in May of 1990, Pam\'s life took a tragic turn when her husband, Gregg, was found shot to death in their home after an apparent robbery. Pam was devastated and appeared on numerous news programs asking for help in solving her husband\'s murder. A tip led police to the high school where Pam worked, where they arrested two teen-aged boys. One of them was Billy Flynn, a 15-year-old student who claimed Pam was his lover. Flynn told the authorities he had killed Greg Smart at Pam\'s request. Another teen, Cecelia Pierce, agreed to help police record conversations with Pam about the murder. Caught on tape coaching the girl on what to say, one-time media darling Pam Smart was arrested and charged with murder. Prosecutors claimed she was bored with her husband and had him killed so she could collect his life insurance money.

She is serving life in prison without the possibility of parole.At 31, Donna Yaklich was married to a Pueblo Colorado narcotics detective, and raising a son and four stepchildren on the family\'s farm. One December evening in 1985, shots rang out, killing her husband Dennis. The authorities struggled to find clues to the execution style shooting. They suspected it was linked to Dennis\' work as a narcotics detective. After months of dead ends, a tip led them to two teenage gunmen... and eventually back to Donna Yaklich, herself. But Donna had another surprise for the authorities. Her attorneys argued she was a battered woman and the murder was her last desperate attempt to end the abuse. It was a controversial legal move, claiming that she hired the hit men in self-defense. After one mistrial, and a grueling second trial, Donna Yaklich was acquitted of first-degree murder. But she was convicted on the charge of conspiracy. She was sentenced to forty years in prison. Now eligible for parole, Donna says she is sorry for her crime.Yesenia Patino was the other woman. The exotic 34-year-old brunette was living very comfortably, thanks to her generous, and married, lover Daniel Willoughby. In February of 1991, Dan\'s wealthy wife was brutally murdered while on vacation in Mexico. Arizona authorities opened their own investigation, suspicious of husband Dan and his mistress. While delving into the murder, cops uncovered Yesenia\'s big secret: she was a transsexual. Not even her lover knew that she had been born a man. When Yesenia was arrested, she admitted that she had helped Dan kill his wife so she could start a new life with him. Yesenia delivered the testimony that put Dan on death row. For her involvement, Yesenia was sentenced to 35 years in a Mexican prison. Five years later, Yesenia claimed that she had committed the murder on her own.

Yesenia remains in prison.German native Manuela Garcia had fallen in love with an American serviceman and moved to Colorado. But 15 years into her marriage, the mother of three wanted to return home. Instead, in July of 1996, Manuela landed in a Colorado police station, after hacking her husband to death with an axe. She told officers her husband had forced himself on her and she had grabbed the axe to protect herself. Investigators found flaws in Manuela\'s story, most notably evidence that her husband had been drugged and unable to fend off the deadly axe attack. Prosecutors say she planned the attack in an attempt to free herself from her husband and return to Germany. Defense attorneys, however, described her as a battered woman, driven to kill after more than a decade of abuse. The jury found Manuela guilty of second-degree murder, but the conviction was overturned on appeal. Facing a second trial, Manuela pled guilty and was sentenced to 16 years in prison.Jeena Han had overcome a difficult childhood to become co-valedictorian at her high school, just like her twin sister Sunny.

When she needed help, her sister Sunny took her in. But sibling rivalry and close quarters proved too much. Their volatile relationship drove them apart. In November of 1996, two assailants bound and gagged Sunny and her roommate, but police intervened before they were harmed. Cops quickly traced the murder attempt back to Sunny\'s twin sister, Jeena. Prosecutors say it was part of a devious plan to assume Sunny\'s identity and leave the country. Jeena and her two accomplices were tried and convicted. She is serving 26 years to life in prison.A doctor\'s wife and mother of five, Dora Cisneros led an ordinary suburban life in Brownsville, Texas.

She was outspoken about her son\'s struggle to stay out of gangs and about the dangers other children in the community faced. She even teamed up with a popular high school senior, Aaron Iturra, to educate other students on gang violence. But when Aaron was executed in his home, police began to suspect that Mary wasn\'t leveling with them. Two teenagers were convicted of the shooting, but wiretaps on Mary\'s phone revealed a startling secret. Eugene\'s anti-gang activist was actually running a street gang out of her living room. And as police had suspected, Mary had ordered the hit on Aaron. She was tried and convicted of aggravated murder and hindering prosecution. Mary was sentenced to life in prison, but on appeal that sentence was reduced to 25 years.Laura Rogers was trapped in an unhappy marriage. Her husband, Walter, was controlling and abusive and had used his contracting work to move the family often and isolate them from friends and relatives. Then, in April of 2004, Walter was killed by a single shotgun blast. Laura claimed it was suicide, but police saw through her story. When her pregnant 16-year-old daughter tried to take the rap for Walter\'s murder, Laura confessed. She had killed Walter and she had a reason. Laura\'s daughter had told her a shocking story. Walter had been raping the 16-year-old and was the father of her baby. Even worse, there was a video tape to prove it. After watching the graphic images of her husband raping her own daughter, Laura was devastated. That night, she walked into the bedroom and shot Walter as he slept. Under a deal with the state\'s attorney, Laura pled guilty, facing up to 10 years in prison. The judge sentenced her to the maximum, and then reduced the sentence to time served, saying Laura had rid the world of a horrible human being.

They lived together in a trailer on a few acres with a view of Washington\'s Mt. Rainer. But Stella wanted more. Then, in June of 1986, Bruce dropped dead on the deck of the trailer. Doctors said it was emphysema; Stella swore it was the Excedrin he\'d taken just moments before his collapse. Six days later, a local woman died of cyanide poisoning from tainted Excedrin capsules. More tainted pills were found on a drugstore shelf, which led to a nationwide recall. That\'s when Stella Nickell called police. She said she had some of the recalled Excedrin and believed that tainted capsules had killed her husband, too. A test confirmed cyanide in his system, making Stella eligible for an extra hundred thousand dollars from Bruce\'s life insurance. But that money, coupled with flecks of algae found in the tainted capsules, also made her the prime suspect. The blockbuster testimony of Stella\'s own daughter, who claimed Stella had been trying to get rid of Bruce for years, sealed Stella\'s fate. Stella was arrested and charged with federal product tampering. A jury convicted her and sentenced her to 90 years in a federal penitentiary.Blonde, beautiful and ambitious, Kim Anderson never had any trouble finding success or successful men. In fact, by the time she was 34, Kim had been married to two of them, and had given birth to two children by each. Her second husband, Brent Anderson, was a successful divorce attorney from the nearby town of Celina. Shortly after the birth of her fourth child, Kim\'s marriage to Brent began to falter. Brent filed for divorce in October of 2000, and a bitter custody battled ensued. Just a few days before the divorce was to be final, Kim called 911 and told police that she had shot her husband. Cops found Brent lying dead in a bedroom closet with eight bullets in him. According to Kim, when she confronted her husband about his alleged molestation of their son, he became enraged and lunged at her. She claimed she instinctively picked up her handgun and shot. At trial, her attorneys argued she had acted in self-defense. But, prosecutors argued that the shooting was premeditated, pointing out that Kim had never claimed spousal abuse during the divorce proceedings. In a controversial verdict, the jury acquitted Kim of all charges in the killing. Brent\'s family sued her in civil court and the civil jury didn\'t believe she was in imminent danger at the time of the shooting. They ordered her to pay $540,000 to her husband\'s family.Gail Bennett had led a life of hard choices. Raised on a Texas farm, she had spent her childhood taking care of her siblings. When she left home, she began a string of bad marriages. By 1990, she was filing for her third divorce. With one daughter grown, and a son living with her second ex-husband, Gail was at a crossroads in her life. That\'s when ex-husband number three, Tony, convinced her to come back to him. She did, and immediately regretted it. During a drunken rage, Tony brandished a rifle and threatened Gail. She pulled her pistol and shot him, wounding him. But that wouldn\'t be the worst part of the night. Sheriff Presley Lamar Pippin decided to let her go and even gave her a ride home. He offered to stand guard, in case Tony came back. Later that night, Pippin came into Gail\'s bedroom and forced himself on her. Fearing the Sheriff\'s power, and the pending charges in the shooting of her husband, Gail kept quiet about the rape. But when a grand jury decided not to indict Gail for shooting Tony, she went to the Austin Police about the rape. The case went before a grand jury, but Sheriff Pippin claimed the sex was consensual. Pippin wasn\'t indicted, and was soon re-elected. But Gail wasn\'t finished. She filed a civil suit, claiming the Sheriff had violated her civil rights. The federal judge didn\'t buy Sheriff Pippin\'s claim of consensual sex and admonished him for his abuse of police authority. The Sheriff and Archer County were ordered to pay $2 million in damages, though the award was reduced on appeal.It looked like Sandy Murphy had hit the jackpot when she started dating wealthy casino heir Ted Binion.

She was married and had started a successful business. But, Martha\'s relationship with her husband, Jeffrey, was troubled. She became depressed and started taking a cocktail of anti-depressants and painkillers. She also started looking elsewhere for companionship. In 2004, she met three younger Hispanic men after a fireworks display in downtown Nashville and took them to a hotel where they continued the \"party.\" Martha began a relationship with one of them, Rafael de Jesus Rocha-Perez. She separated from Jeffrey and moved into an extended stay hotel with Rafael. But, Jeffrey was determined to patch things up and convinced her to move back. She agreed, but she didn\'t return alone. Rafael secretly took up residence in the guest bedroom closet and managed to go unnoticed by Jeffrey, who worked long hours and rarely went into that part of the house. But, on Sunday April 10, 2005, Jeffery heard snoring coming from the closet and found the unwanted houseguest. Almost 24 hours later, Martha called police to report a murder. When police arrived at the scene, they found Jeffrey\'s corpse soaking wet on the bathroom floor with a black plastic bag tied around his head. Martha and Rafael were tried together, and each pointed the finger at the other. But, neither convinced the jury. They were both convicted of first-degree murder in September 2006 and sentenced to life in prison.Amy Bosley and her husband, Robert, were making a name for themselves in their small Kentucky community. Together they ran a successful roofing and chimney sweep business. But, tragedy struck on the night of May 17, 2005. Police received a frantic call from Amy claiming an intruder had shot Bob and was still in the house. Police launched a manhunt for the intruder, but the lead investigator immediately suspected something was wrong with Amy\'s story. Bob had been shot seven times while sleeping, and his gun was missing. Also missing were the shell casings, which should have littered the crime scene. When police found the missing casings in the Bosley\'s washing machine, they placed Amy under arrest. Police also discovered a motive: the Bosleys were deep in debt, and, unknown to Bob, the IRS was literally knocking at their door over a $1.5 million tax bill. Amy first pleaded not guilty, but her case didn\'t hold up well during a dramatic four-hour pretrial hearing, and she reconsidered. In September of 2006, she pled guilty in a deal strongly influenced by Bob\'s family. His parents, now raising the couple\'s two children, wanted to spare the kids from having to testify against their mother.Kimberly Cunningham had known Coy Hundley for 18 years, and she trusted him. As her sister\'s longtime boyfriend, Coy was practically an uncle to Kimberly\'s three children, and he often had them over to his home. He was the farthest thing from Kimberly\'s mind when she tried to discover why her 16-year-old daughter was depressed. The teenager told her mom that she had a terrible secret that she had been keeping from her mom for seven years: Coy Hundley and his son - her cousin -- had been sexually molesting her since she was nine years old. Furious, Kimberly drove to Hundley\'s workplace the next morning to confront him. When Hundley laughed and asked her what she was going to do about it, Kimberly pulled out a gun and shot him eight times. She then drove herself to the sheriff\'s office and turned herself in. When she went to trial, the jury deadlocked. At a second trial, the jury found her guilty of voluntary manslaughter, killing in the heat of passion. The judge sentenced Kimberly to four years in prison. She\'s still out on bond, pending the outcome of an appeal.In 1987, four-time divorcee Margaret Frost married Las Vegas real-estate mogul, Ron Rudin. With Ron\'s $11 million dollar fortune to draw from, Margaret was thrilled to be able to pursue her passion for buying and selling antique furniture. By 1994, however, Ron\'s penchant for women and alcohol had put some serious cracks in the Rudin\'s once rock-solid marriage. Things only got worse when 64-year-old Ron mysteriously disappeared on December 18, 1994. A month later, Ron\'s burnt body was discovered by three fishermen near Lake Mojave, Nevada. Found with him were pieces of an antique trunk that authorities were able to trace back to Margaret. Police built their case against Ron\'s widow and, by April of 1997, authorities finally had enough evidence for a murder indictment against 52-year-old Margaret. But by that time, she had gone on the lam. In 1999, Margaret was discovered living in Revere, Massachusetts with retired firefighter Joseph Lundergan. She\'d been telling people her husband was killed by a terrorist. On May 2, 2001, seven years after Ron was killed, Margaret was found guilty of murder. She received a sentence of 20 years in prison.When 15-year-old Susan Bolling\'s parents sent her to respected therapist Felix Polk, they had no way of seeing the future, no way of knowing that almost 30 years later, Susan would be would be Felix\'s wife, the mother of his children - and his murderer. Less than a year after Susan\'s therapy began, the middle-aged psychologist had fallen in love with his young patient. They married when Susan was 25, and over the next 20 years Susan raised their three sons while Felix\'s career as a therapist, lecturer and teacher flourished. To the outside world, they were a perfect family; inside, Susan and Felix were waging a violent battle of wills, each at times threatening to kill the other, and forcing their sons to choose sides. The war of the Polks reached its climax in October of 2002, after Susan moved out, and a judge granted Felix custody of their son and the house. Days later, on Monday, October 14, their youngest son came home to find his father\'s dead body. He had been knocked unconscious and stabbed 27 times in the chest, sides, arms, legs, and feet. Susan claimed she killed Felix in self-defense. During her trial, Susan fired a series of court appointed attorneys and represented herself. She was convicted of 2nd degree murder and sentenced to serve 16 years to life in prison.Matthew and Mary Winkler were well known in the small town of Selmer, Tennessee. Matthew was the popular young pastor of the Fourth Street Church of Christ, and Mary was his cheerful wife, a stay-at-home mom who kept busy caring for the couple\'s three young daughters. But, the Winkler\'s 10-year marriage would come to a quick and violent end in March, 2006. When Matthew didn\'t show up for a Wednesday night service, several congregants went to the Winkler home to check on him. They found Matthew dead in the bedroom, shot in the back. Mary and the girls were nowhere to be found. An Amber alert for the girls led police to Alabama, where they found Mary and her daughters safe. Then, authorities promptly arrested Mary for Matthew\'s murder. She confessed, telling police that she and Matthew had argued the evening of March 20th, and the next morning, she retrieved a shotgun from the closet and shot Matthew in the back while he lay in bed. Mary said that between Matthew\'s constant criticism and arguments over money, she had finally \"snapped.\" Police later learned that, unknown to Matthew, Mary had deposited more than $17,000 worth of bad checks into the family\'s account. At trial, her attorneys claimed she was an innocent victim of a notorious check scam operation. Prosecutors contended that she knew exactly what she was doing, since she had withdrawn most of the money before the checks cleared and deposited the cash into a private account. In April 2007, Mary was acquitted of murder but convicted on the charge of manslaughter. She served 60 days in a mental health facility, and was released on August 14, 2007.Jessica McCord and her ex-husband Alan Bates had a bitter divorce, and an even more bitter custody battle over their two young daughters. Both Jessica and Alan had remarried: Jessica to a police officer she met while working as a secretary for the Birmingham Police Department, Alan to a co-worker in a Maryland theater company. In the seven years following their divorce, Jessica had repeatedly tried to deny Alan visitation and contact with his daughters, moving frequently and having her phone number changed so he couldn\'t call. When Alan flew to Birmingham from Maryland in February of 2002, he and Jessica would have their final showdown over their daughters. They met in a lawyer\'s office to hammer out a new custody agreement. Later that afternoon, Alan and his wife went to the McCord\'s home to pick up the girls, but Jessica had a different plan. She lured them into the back of the house, where her police officer husband shot them both multiple times. The McCords then set out to create an alibi, buying theater tickets and visiting Home Depot. Afterwards, they drove the Bates\' rental car several hours into Georgia, with the bodies in the trunk, and torched it. When police discovered the bodies, it didn\'t take long to trace the Bates\' movements back to the McCord home. Crime scene techs found traces of blood, a bullet that matched a bullet found in one of the bodies, and evidence of a cleanup. At her trial, prosecutors claimed that Jessica was a vindictive woman with a history of violence against her ex. The defense could only find one character witness to speak in Jessica\'s favor: her mother. The jury found her guilty and sentenced her to life.Pretty, ambitious, 24-year-old law student Adrienne Hickson was looking forward to a career in criminal law, and to spending her life with her college sweetheart, Shawn Washington. After college, she got into a prestigious law school in Washington, D.C. while Shawn got a full-time job in Atlanta. They stayed together despite the 600 miles separating them. But, after a year apart, the long-distance relationship was showing signs of strain. When Adrienne went to Atlanta to visit Shawn in December, 2005, they fought constantly. She began to time him when he went out and called constantly to keep tabs on him. On December 21, after a loud argument in the parking lot of Shawn\'s apartment, the two decided to take the fight inside. Ten minutes later, Shawn stumbled back out, covered in blood and clutching his shoulder. While friends rushed him to the hospital, Adrienne got in her car and went home to her family in South Carolina. She came back on Christmas night to visit Shawn in the hospital but discovered he was dead -- and there was a warrant out for her arrest. In June, 2007, the former law student found herself in a courtroom, not as an attorney, but as a defendant. Her defense claimed she was a battered woman; the prosecutor said that Adrienne was the one with a history of violence. When the jury deadlocked, Adrienne took an Alford plea, which meant she accepted punishment, without admitting guilt. She was sentenced to five years in prison.After nine years of marriage to a Navy man, Elizabeth Reynolds had settled back in the small Texas neighborhood where she and her husband both grew up. While he finished his tour of duty, Elizabeth stayed in Texas, working on the couple\'s home and finishing her bachelor\'s degree in psychology at Texas A&M. But the lonely Elizabeth soon became infatuated with a local man, Albert Benitez. Benitez was a former police officer who was teaching law enforcement at a nearly community college. Elizabeth signed up for Albert\'s class, and it wasn\'t long before she became interested in more than what her professor had to say. They began dating, and Elizabeth not only initiated divorce proceedings against her husband, she began to change herself to please Albert; she had a tummy tuck, got braces and died her hair blonde. But after all the time and money spent to please him, she discovered Albert was still seeing other women. On the night of August 8, 2003, Elizabeth brought pizza and a movie to Albert\'s house, and spent the night. The next morning at 7:30am, as they were getting ready to leave the house, a strange man knocked on the door, and when Albert answered, the man opened fire on him. When the shooter drove away with Elizabeth in the car, Albert managed to call 911 to report that he was shot and his girlfriend kidnapped by the shooter. Although he has pronounced dead five times during surgery, Albert survived. When Elizabeth mysteriously turned up unharmed and without a good explanation of how she escaped, the local police became suspicious. Eventually they found Albert\'s would-be assassin - and a money trail that lead right back to Elizabeth. She was arrested and tried for criminal solicitation. She was sentenced to life, and won\'t be eligible for parole for 60 years.Lynn Womack was a 911 operator when she met and married Atlanta police officer Glenn Turner in 1993. But it wasn\'t long before the two began to have serious problems: Lynn spent Glenn\'s money as fast as he could make it, and she also spent frequent weekends away from home. In March of 1995, Glenn went to the emergency room, complaining of vomiting, diarrhea and nosebleeds. By the next day, he was dead. The official cause of death was an irregular heartbeat. Four days after his funeral, Lynn moved in with another man, firefighter Randy Thompson. She spent Glenn\'s insurance money on a cruise and expensive presents for Randy. Over the next few years, they had two children together, but their relationship, too, was turbulent. In January of 2001, Randy visited the emergency room. Like Glenn, he was suffering from vomiting and diarrhea. Like Glenn, he was dead within 24 hours. Again, the cause of death was listed as heart disease. Glenn and Randy\'s mothers convinced police that it was not mere coincidence that their sons died similar deaths while involved with Lynn. Both men were exhumed, and new autopsies revealed crystallized ethylene glycol - a toxin found in antifreeze -- in their kidneys. Lynn was arrested for Glenn\'s murder, and a jury found her guilty in 2004. Shortly after she was sentenced to spend life in prison for Glenn\'s death, she was charged with Randy\'s murder. In 2007, she was tried and convicted for his murder, as well.Kathleen Denson was a self-made woman living the good life in one of the wealthiest resort towns in America. A successful furrier with stores in both Vail and Aspen, she had a home in Vail and a ranch in the mountains to retreat to when she wanted a little more privacy. And that came in handy when Denson began dating local playboy Gerald \"Cody\" Boyd - a hard-livin\' and lovin\' Texan who\'d had a string of rich Aspen lovers. Boyd and Denson spent the next several months at the ranch house doing cocaine and videotaping themselves having sex. But the relationship took an even kinkier turn when Cody also started dating Monica Seebacher, an employee at Denson\'s Aspen store. In May, the threesome went to Cancun together - on Denson\'s tab. But, it soon became clear that three was a crowd. One fall evening in 2002, Aspen police responded to a 911 call placed from Denson\'s ranch. There they found Cody Boyd, shot to death with an antique black-powder pistol that was part of his extensive collection. Kathleen Denson told police she had shot him in self-defense. Police weren\'t so sure. They charged her with 2nd degree murder. Each day of her trial Denson showed up in a different Armani pants suit. She may have looked good, but her case didn\'t. Cody was unarmed when he was shot and there was no sign of a prior struggle. Denson\'s lawyers painted Cody as an out-of-control drug addict, using, as proof, an earlier restraining order taken out by his ex-wife, and an autopsy report that showed Boyd was high on coke when he was shot. The jury believed it. In August of 2003, Denson was acquitted.In 2005, Misty Witherspoon accidentally shot her police officer husband, Quinn, with his service weapon. But, when police learned the grieving widow had also embezzled money from her church to cover the family\'s debt, it wasn\'t long before they saw Quinn\'s life insurance as a motive to kill.Former beauty queen and Akron socialite Cynthia George\'s life seemed charmed. She met and married wealthy restaurateur Ed George in 1984, raised seven healthy children, and lived in a sprawling 8000-foot mansion. Locally, the wealthy couple wielded power and exuded glamor. In 2000, Cynthia came in fourth in the Mrs. Ohio beauty pageant. But behind her glamorous exterior, Cynthia hid a secret second life. Her secrets would be opened for the world to see when 44-year-old Jeff Zack was shot and killed by a man on a motorcycle in June, 2001. The police investigating Jeff\'s murder discovered that he had been Cynthia George\'s lover, and was the father of one of her children - which could be a motive for Cynthia\'s husband to want Jeff dead. Still, there was no physical evidence to tie either of the Georges to the crime. Police got their break when a woman called police and said she believed her ex-husband, John Zaffino, had killed Jeff. Police were stunned - it seemed their investigation had been completely off base. They turned their attention to Zaffino and discovered he had bought a gun and a motorcycle just weeks before Jeff\'s murder. But the investigation soon led detectives right back where they started: Cynthia George. Cynthia had also been having an affair with Zaffino, and had told Zaffino that Jeff was abusing her. She had given Zaffino the money used to buy the gun and motorcycle. Police arrested both Cynthia and Zaffino and charged them with Jeff\'s murder. During Zaffino\'s trial - and as she awaited her own trial -- Cynthia continued to write him letters. Cynthia\'s attorneys convinced Cynthia to have her case tried before a judge instead of a jury. Ed George stood loyally by his wife and testified on her behalf. But the judge found her guilty of complicity in the murder and sentenced her to life in prison. A year later, the District Court of Appeals overturned the decision, claiming the state failed to provide the evidence to support the judge\'s decision. Cynthia was released from prison in March, 2007.A man awakens alone to find a knife-wielding man in his bedroom -- but is his absent wife a victim or an accomplice?Erika Elaine Grace was an ideal child with an idyllic childhood. A well-liked honor student and a gifted basketball player, she was the center of her parents\' world. After high school, she went to a prestigious private college on a partial basketball scholarship, and graduated with a Bachelor degree in history. She surprised her parents by coming home with more than a degree - she brought a new husband, a 23-year-old ex-Navy SEAL named Benjamin Sifrit, known to his family and friends by the nickname B.J. Her wealthy parents were not happy with her new husband, but tried to support their daughter. They helped the young couple open a business, assembling scrapbooks for customers. In May, 2002, Erika and B.J. took a break from the business to go on vacation in Ocean City, Maryland. But, on May 31, the couple found themselves in trouble. They were arrested for trying to steal over $5000 worth of merchandise from a Hooter\'s store. When police interrogated Erika, they got a lot more than they bargained for. Erika admitted that she and B.J. were behind the disappearance of another couple, Martha Crutchley and Joshua Ford. The couple had been reported missing earlier in the week, but police had no leads until the Sifrits\' arrest. Erika said she and B.J. had met the couple in a bar and asked them back to their condominium, where B.J. had shot them and dismembered the bodies. The Sifrits had then taken the bodies to a dumpster in Delaware. Police charged Erika and B.J. with murder. Searching the Sifrits\' vehicle and condo, police found that Erika didn\'t just help her scrapbooking customers preserve memories -- she also compulsively preserved her own. She had kept photographs of the murdered couple, the couple\'s ID cards, and spent bullets casings. She also wore Joshua Ford\'s blood-flecked ring around her neck on a chain. B.J. Sifrit went to trial before his wife, and blamed the murders on her. He claimed he had been asleep in their Jeep, and Erika woke him up to say she had killed Crutchley and Ford and needed his help disposing of the bodies. The jury believed him, only finding him guilty of the second-degree murder of Crutchley, and not guilty of Ford\'s murder. Erika was not so lucky. The jury found the woman prosecutors called \"Little Miss Scrapbook\" guilty of first-degree murder on both counts and sentenced her to life in prison.A woman eludes police for six years after a confrontation with her neighbor turns deadly.In 1999, the hot gossip in small Morgantown, West Virginia was 27-year-old pediatric nurse Shelley Angus. Shelley was recently separated from her husband of five years and had taken up with a married man, local businessman Jimmy Michael. After a year of dating on the sly, Jimmy divorced his wife and married Shelley in May of 2000. She and Jimmy bought a big house in an upscale suburb, and were active in the community. But, five years into their marriage, Shelley would once again be the talk of the town, and, once again, the rumor was she was having an affair with a married man. There were also rumors that she had an abortion, even though it was common knowledge that Jimmy had had a vasectomy. She was also one violation away from getting fired from her nursing job. Still, the town rallied around Shelley when tragedy struck. On the morning of November 29, 2005, a neighbor called Shelley at work with news that her house was burning; when she got to the house, she discovered Jimmy had died in the fire. In the months that followed, Shelley collected almost $600,000 in insurance money. But, while she was collecting insurance, the police were collecting evidence. On an anonymous tip, the coroner tested Jimmy for rocuronium -- a drug used to induce paralysis during surgery - and determined Jimmy had the drug in his system when the fire started. Fire investigators also determined the house fire had been deliberately set. When authorities discovered Shelley had been seen pulling out of her driveway right before the fire, and that, as a nurse, she had free access to rocuronium, they charged her with first-degree murder. At her trial, the prosecution claimed Shelley was motivated by infidelity, boredom with her job, and the idea of a big insurance payout. Shelley took the stand and denied it all. After three days of deliberation, the jury found her guilty and she received a mandatory life sentence. But the jury also recommended mercy: Shelley will be eligible for parole in 15 years.Linda Henning was a mild mannered fashion designer sewing a comfortable life for herself in the Southwest fashion circuit. The 48-year-old was romantically involved with a married man, the charismatic Daizien Hossencofft. In September of 1999, Hossencofft\'s estranged wife Girly Chew disappeared. Co-workers of the Malaysian woman feared for her life, citing her recent break-up with Daizien. Police found evidence of a struggle in Girly\'s apartment, but her body was never found. Blood at the scene led them to Linda Henning. She was arrested and charged with murder. Daizien was arrested for masterminding the plot to kill his wife. As investigators delved into the case, they discovered Linda\'s strange beliefs about UFO\'s and that the government is run by reptilian aliens. Daizien made a plea agreement to avoid the death penalty in the killing. He admitted to ordering the killing and swore Linda was not involved, claiming Linda\'s blood was at the scene because he spilled a vial of it in an attempt to confuse the police. Linda\'s attorney\'s say she was Daizien\'s victim, that the conman had brainwashed her into being his alibi. But prosecutors say Henning killed Girly Chew in an attempt to prove her love for Daizien. Despite the strange tales of brainwashing and aliens, the jury convicted Henning of murder. She was sentenced to 73 years in prison.Pretty, petite Darlene Doskocil and handsome, outgoing Keith Gentry met at their small Texas college. They started dating when they discovered a mutual love of beer, dancing, and deer hunting. When she finished up her nursing degree, she moved to Dallas for work, but Keith charmed her back into the small town life in Robinson, Texas. They got married and had three boys, but their marriage soon began to show signs of strain. With Keith working long hours, Darlene frequently left the kids with Keith\'s parents while she went out with friends. Concerned, Keith quit his high-paying job so he could be home for the kids when Darlene was away. Then, just after 6 a.m. on November 9, 2005, Darlene called 911 to say her house had been broken into and her husband had been shot. Paramedics found Keith lying in bed unconscious; he died a few hours later. Friends and family rushed to console Darlene over the death of her husband. She and the kids moved in with Keith\'s parents. But as police investigated Keith\'s murder, the evidence began to mount against Darlene. First, there was the murder scene. Investigators claimed it looked staged. Then, police found rubber gloves at the bottom of the kitchen trashcan, which contained shell casings, gunshot residue, and only two DNA profiles: Keith\'s and Darlene\'s. Police also found it suspicious that although Darlene was a nurse, she had made no apparent effort to save her husband. But, the most damning evidence was a secret video made by Texas Rangers. The video captured Darlene as she systematically searched the bottom of a pond-in the exact spot where the murder weapon had been found two days earlier. It took a jury only 5 hours to convict Darlene of first-degree murder. She was sentenced to 60 years.A military wife is caught in deadly love triangle.A popular professor\'s death looks like an accident, but turns into a murder mystery with his widow at the center.When grandmother Ann Trexler relocated to Florida, it wasn\'t just to spend her retirement years in the sun. Ann wanted to spend more time with her oldest daughter, Tina, and her six-year-old granddaughter. Tina shared custody of the child with her ex-husband Ron, an arrangement that worked well until \"Moms\" Ann moved to town. Ann threw herself into her role as grandmother, and resented the child\'s closeness with Ron and, especially, Ron\'s new wife. In August of 1998, Ron petitioned the court to give him primary custody, telling the court that his ex-wife and her mother were disrupting his daughter\'s school and social life, cursing his new wife in front of the child, and their hostility was affecting the girl\'s physical and mental health. But the court never had a chance to rule on Ron\'s petition. On the morning of October 6, when Ron opened the door to leave for work, a shot rang out. As Ron ran back into the house the shooter followed, shooting him eight times, while his panicked wife called 911 from the bedroom. Before he fled, Ron\'s wife heard the shooter say, \"This is for her.\" Ron bled to dead on the kitchen floor, curled up in the fetal position. Investigators believed Ron had been targeted for execution, but when the alibis of the usual suspects - his current wife and his ex - checked out, the investigation stalled. The break in the case came when police found the murder weapon, and traced it back to local hairdresser, Kim MIller - Ann Trexler\'s hairdresser. Faced with a murder charge, the Kim confessed that Ann had frequently wished aloud that Ron was out of the picture, so Kim hooked her up with someone who could make that wish come true. Using Kim as a go-between, Ann paid a man $10,000 to take Ron out. At her trial, prosecutors used Kim\'s confession, bank records showing the money trail, and cell phone records to prove Ann was behind Ron\'s murder. The defense claimed Ann was an innocent, church-going grandmother who was being framed by a drug addict working the system to get out of a murder charge. But the jury didn\'t buy the innocent grandmother act - they took just two hours to find Ann guilty and sentence her to life in prison.In April, 2001, 38-year-old Kerri Faye Brown had just given birth to a baby girl, fathered by her on-again, off-again boyfriend. He was a tribal police officer working in Arizona, and, after their latest breakup, Kerri had moved to Orem, Utah to live with her sister. She found a job as an activities director at an upscale retirement center owned by Mina Pajela. Mina was so impressed with Kerri that she promoted her to administrator. With her own daughter living in California, Mina came to view Kerri as a surrogate daughter, and Keri frequently stayed at Mina\'s home. When Kerri discovered she was pregnant, Mina was supportive. Then, on April 25, 2001, Mina was found shot to death in her car. Witnesses reported seeing a woman trying to set the car on fire. Police began investigating, and while at first they didn\'t come up with any suspects, they did discover that someone had embezzled close to $40,000 from the retirement center. Further investigation revealed the identity of the embezzler - Kerri Faye Brown. Kerri, in the meantime, had moved back to Arizona with her boyfriend and their baby. In November, 2001 Kerri was charged with multiple financial crimes. When forensic tests proved that the murder weapon belonged to Kerri\'s boyfriend, she was also charged with Mina\'s murder. But, in 2002, the charges were dropped; prosecutors felt they needed more time to built their case. Two years later, they refiled charges against Kerri. In August, 2005, before she was scheduled to go to trial, Kerri pleaded no contest to manslaughter and theft by deception. She told the judge that she took the plea, not because she was guilty, but because she was tired of fighting. She was sent to serve up to 30 years for manslaughter and theft.After three years of marriage, college sweethearts Ann and Eric Miller had a young daughter, a beautiful home, and two successful careers. She was a research scientist at a major pharmaceutical company. He was a pediatric AIDS researcher at the University of North Carolina. But on the night of November 15, 2000, Eric Miller developed a mysterious illness. That evening, Eric had gone bowling with Derril Willard, one of his wife\'s coworkers. An hour into the outing, Miller was admitted into the hospital with flu-like symptoms. The symptoms soon passed and the doctors sent Eric home. But two weeks later, on November 30, 2000, he was in the ER again with the same flu-like symptoms. This time tests revealed arsenic in Eric\'s system. On December 2, 2000, just as he appeared on the road to recovery, Eric Miller died of cardiac arrest. The autopsy said it was due to arsenic. Police quickly focused their attention on Ann. A search of the lab shared with Derril Willard turned up traces of arsenic and evidence of an affair between the two scientists. On January 21, 2001, police searched Willard\'s home and asked him to come in for questioning. Instead, he took his own life; but not before confessing to his lawyer that it was Ann that gave Eric Miller the fatal dose of arsenic. Willard told his attorney Ann had persuaded him to spike Miller\'s beer with arsenic at the bowling alley on November 15, but when Eric didn\'t die, she decided to lace his food. Days later, according to what Willard told his attorney, she\'d injected arsenic directly into her husband\'s IV as he lay in his hospital room, causing the heart attack that killed him. Willard\'s suicide, however, complicated pressing charges against Ann until September 27, 2004, when a grand jury indicted her for first-degree murder charges. Ann, who had remarried, pled guilty a year later to second degree and conspiracy to commit first-degree murder. She is serving 25-31  years in a woman\'s correctional facility.Soft-spoken 3rd grade teacher Elicia Hughes and her handsome, computer whiz husband Brian married in 1999, and, five years later, they had two young daughters and a comfortable suburban life. That changed the night of June 3, 2004. The Hinds County 911 center received a call from Elicia, claiming her husband had been shot. When EMT\'s arrived, Brian was already dead. Elicia told police that she had been asleep, but woke up when she heard popping noises, followed by the home alarm system going off. When she got up to investigate, she discovered the front door open, and Brian lying dead on the living room floor. Investigators found no signs of forced entry, but they did find spent shell casings inside and outside the house. They also discovered Brian\'s .45-caliber handgun was missing. The investigation dragged on for nine months; in the meantime, Elicia collected $250,000 in life insurance, and made plans to sell her home and move with her children to Florida. But, in March of 2005, her plans were derailed when police arrested her for Brian\'s murder. At her trial, prosecutors claimed Elicia was tired of Brian\'s philandering, and decided he was worth more dead than alive. They told the jury Elicia had made a telling statement to detectives when she told them she heard gunshots, followed by the alarm; if there had been an intruder, she would have heard the alarm first. Her defense countered that Elicia was confused and distressed when she made that statement, and that is was more likely Brian was shot by the jealous husband or boyfriend of one of his many lovers. Prosecutors then put one of Brian\'s lovers on the stand, and she told the jury that, on the night of the murder, she had been talking to Brian on his cell phone, but he had hung up when Elicia walked into the room. Cell phone records showed that the call had ended around 11:15pm - within five minutes of the time Elicia claimed to have been awakened by the popping noises. It only took jurors two hours to find her guilty of first-degree murder. She was sentenced to life in prison, but got a reprieve in February 2007. The trial judge granted Elicia a new trial, citing racial discrimination in the jury selection at her first trial. At her second trial, she had better luck with the jury; they acquitted her of Brian\'s murder in November 2007.Linda Fields was a no-nonsense, hard worker running a Nevada cattle ranch with her husband Vern. The ranch was in financial trouble, and so was their marriage, but the couple continued to stick it out in spite of the difficulties. They received a windfall when police found the body of Jeromir Palensky in the Jordan River in Utah. Palensky had been working as a ranch hand for the Fields. A Czech immigrant who had no family in the U.S., Palensky had left behind a will and a $300,000 life insurance policy, with the Fields as his beneficiaries. Shortly after Palensky\'s death, Linda cashed in on the will and applied for the insurance payout. But Palensky\'s relatives from the Czech Republic filed suit to claim the insurance. Meanwhile, investigators continued searching for Palensky\'s killer, and Linda Fields went from wealthy heir to prime suspect. Investigators discovered that Linda had obtained a power of attorney from him, and had taken out the $300,000 life insurance policy on Palensky herself. The will, which left land and other belongings to the Fields, had been forged by Vern. An autopsy determined Palensky hadn\'t drowned-he\'d been killed by blunt force trauma to the head a month before his body was found. His watch had stopped on the date of the 19th. -- the last day he was on the Fields\' ranch. But investigators didn\'t have enough evidence to get an indictment. As time went by, Linda became over-confident that she\'d gotten away with murder. She began telling friends about taking the body to Utah. When one of those friends went to the police, Linda was finally indicted for Palensky\'s murder, three years after his body had been found. At her trial, prosecutors argued that Linda had masterminded the murder and had driven Palensky\'s body over 200 miles to divert attention from the ranch. When Linda took the stand, she proclaimed her innocence, saying she had only tried to help Palensky. The jury found her story unconvincing, returning with a guilty verdict, and convicting her of life in prison. A few months later, Vern Fields was also convicted of the murder.A mother is hailed as a hero when she kills a home intruder -- but a secret journal leads police to suspect she may have planned a cold-blooded murder.Shawna Nelson was a stay-at-home mom to her three children, aged eight, six and 10-months. The former police dispatcher had quit her job after the new baby arrived, and she was active in the older children\'s activities: Girl Scouts, Cub Scouts and sports. But her life was far from picture perfect. Her 11-year marriage to a sheriff\'s detective had recently been tested, when, in 2005, her husband discovered Shawna was having an affair with a married police officer named Ignacio Garrus. Shawna\'s husband also learned Shawna was pregnant with Garrus\' baby. After filing for divorce, the Nelsons decided to reconcile and keep the baby\'s real paternity a secret. The reconciliation didn\'t last long. Secretly, Shawna continued to see her lover, until, before Christmas of 2006, Garrus made a final break. He told Shawna he couldn\'t leave his wife, Heather, and their young daughter. Shawna continued to try to see him, and was convinced that his wife was to blame when Garrus took out a restraining order against her. On January 23, 2007, Shawna snapped. Wearing a mask, she waited for her rival outside of the credit union where Heather was a manager. When Heather emerged, Shawna told her she had ruined her life, and made her get on her knees. She then shot Heather, execution-style, and drove away. Shawna was pulled over within minutes, and put under arrest for Heather\'s murder. A search of her home turned up several guns and photographs of costume masks similar to the one the shooter was wearing. Interviews with Heather\'s friends revealed that Shawna had been harassing her for weeks, sending threatening text messages and challenging her to fight. A friend of Shawna\'s also told police that Shawna would vent by going to target practice and picturing Heather\'s face as the target. A few months after her arrest, Shawna\'s husband quit his job amid rumors that he had been having an affair of his own with a local prosecutor. In March of 2008, a jury found Shawna guilty of Heather\'s murder and sentenced her to life in prison.Gorgeous, sexy Jeanette Sliwinski was a real attention grabber. The daughter of hard-working Polish immigrants, by the time she\'d finished high school, her family had become solidly middle class, and she had blossomed into a striking beauty. She began working as a stripper in a local club and taking on modeling jobs to help finance her bachelor\'s degree in marketing. On the surface, Jeanette seemed confident, happy, and headed for success. But that facade was shattered on July 14, 2004. Jeanette blasted through the streets of Skokie at 70 mph in her cherry red Mustang convertible. The wild ride came to an end when her car slammed into a Honda Civic at a stoplight. Inside, three musician friends were heading to lunch. All three were killed instantly, while Jeanette came away with only a broken ankle. Prosecutors charged Jeannette with first-degree murder, and sought a life sentence. But when the case was tried before a judge in December, 2007, Jeanette\'s attorneys argued that she was mentally ill and needed to be in a hospital, not a prison. They told the judge that, in the months leading up to the crash, Jeanette had moved to Los Angeles with her boyfriend, but soon returned home to Illinois. There, she\'d told friends and family that something was wrong with her, but she didn\'t know what. She\'d sought help from several psychiatrists. Her mental illness had become destructive. She had a psychiatric appointment scheduled for the afternoon of July 14, but that appointment didn\'t come soon enough. She told police at the scene of the crash that she had been trying to kill herself when she caused the accident. She insisted that she\'d never intended to kill anyone else. Prosecutors said it didn\'t matter who she\'d wanted to kill; what mattered was that she had gotten behind the wheel of the Mustang with the intent to kill - and had succeeded. The judge agreed that Jeanette was mentally ill, but still found her guilty of the lesser charge of reckless homicide. He sentenced her to eight years in prison. With credit for time served, she will be out in four years.Leslie Ballard lived a privileged life. Her parents ran a successful printing business in Little Rock and paid for her master\'s degree, her condo, her cars, and her vacations. Then she met and married Mike MacKool. Mike was 23 years Leslie\'s senior, had several ex-wives and, as far as Leslie\'s parents were concerned, was overly interested in their money. With Mike in the picture, they were less willing to foot the bill for Leslie\'s lifestyle. When her father died, he left his only daughter just $25,000 of his million-dollar estate. When, less than a month after Leslie\'s father died, her mother was found murdered, a family friend told police to look no further than her own daughter. Mrs. Ballard had confided in friends that she feared Leslie and her husband would try to kill her. When police called Leslie in for questioning, she quickly confessed. She told them that Mike was upset that she\'d gotten such a small inheritance from her father, but, after reading the will, thought he had found a loophole: if her mother died within thirty days, Leslie would get the entire estate. On the day of the murder, he dressed her in dark clothes and a dark wig and provided her with a backpack stocked with wire cutters, a butcher knife, and a rag for cleaning up. He then drove her to her mother\'s home and told her what to do. Leslie stabbed her mother more than 70 times with the butcher knife, then stole some jewelry and the family Cadillac. At her trial, Leslie pleaded not guilty by reason of mental defect. She claimed that Mike was abusive, constantly criticizing and beating her. He had no job, and he\'d made her quit hers. She claimed that she and her mother were best friends until she met Mike, and Mike had brainwashed her to resent her mother. He had told her to kill her mother, and said that if she didn\'t do it, he would kill them both. After the murder, he\'d told her she\'d done a poor job and hid the murder outfit to use as evidence against her if they got caught. The jurors were not sympathetic. They found her guilty and sentenced her to life without parole.Beautiful 33-year-old Mechele Linehan appeared to be the perfect wife and mother. She and husband Colin met as college students and married in 1998. The couple eventually settled down with their daughter in Olympia, Washington, where Colin practiced medicine and Mechele got her Master\'s degree in public administration. Mechele was a model of the suburban supermom: active in her daughter\'s PTA, teaching Sunday school, and volunteering at a rape crisis center. Her friends and neighbors were shocked when, in October of 2006, she was arrested, along with a man named John Carlin, for the 1996 murder of Kent Leppink near Anchorage, Alaska. They were even more shocked when court papers revealed that, in 1996, Mechele had danced at an Anchorage strip joint. It was there that she had met both Leppink and Carlin. She also became engaged to both men - at the same time. When Leppink was found shot to death, Mechele became a suspect. Although police found plenty of motive - Mechele had taken out a $1 million life insurance policy on Leppink just months before his death - they didn\'t have enough evidence to charge her with the crime. Shortly after the murder, Mechele moved to New Orleans, where she met her husband, and started a new life. But, the Alaska police didn\'t drop the investigation. In 2004, when a new cold case unit was formed, investigators took a fresh look at Leppink\'s murder. A break came in 2005, when investigators tracked down Carlin\'s son, who said he had seen his dad and Mechele cleaning off a gun around the time of the murder. Carlin went to trial in March 2007 and was found guilty. Eight months later, a jury also convicted Mechele of first- degree murder. Both were sentenced to 99 years in prison.Beth Ann Carpenter was a classic overachiever. Brainy and self-assured, she got a degree in international law at a prestigious college in Washington, D.C. Back home in Connecticut, she landed a job with Haiman Clein, a powerful real estate attorney in New London. Beth\'s younger sister Kim, on the other hand, had been married and divorced by the age of 20, and had a young daughter she frequently pawned off on her parents while she partied with her latest deadbeat boyfriend. In 1993, Kim married Anson \"Buzz\" Clinton, a hard-partying local who worked odd jobs, but had recently become a male stripper. Not surprisingly, the Carpenter family was opposed to Kim and Buzz\'s marriage, especially when they learned that the couple was living in a converted tool shed behind Buzz\'s parents\' house. Beth Carpenter went to court on behalf of her mother to win custody of Kim\'s daughter, but was shocked when Buzz, acting as Kim\'s lawyer, won the case. A few weeks later, on March 10, 1994, Buzz was found shot to death on a remote stretch of road off I-95. At first, police thought the killing was part of a drug deal gone bad. But, when a tip led them to a notorious drug dealer, he claimed he was a hit man working for local attorney named Haiman Clein. He told cops that Clein had ordered the hit at the request of his lover and employee, Beth Carpenter. The cops went to question Clein and Beth, but both had split town. Eventually, authorities tracked down Beth in Ireland, she gave up Haiman\'s whereabouts. Haiman confessed to being involved in the murder, but cut a deal in exchange for his testimony against Beth. Beth was apprehended in Ireland in January of 1999 and extradited back home. She finally went to trial for Buzz\'s murder in February, 2002. The prosecution\'s star witnesses were Clein and the hitman, but the defense told the jury that, by their own admission, Clein was a cocaine and sex-addicted crook and the hitman a Satan-worshiping drug dealer - not exactly pillars of truth. The defense\'s star witness was Beth herself. She claimed that Clein had seduced her, and had set up the hit on Buzz to impress her. But the jury took one look at the overweight, middle-aged Clein and the redheaded beauty, and decided Beth was the one who had done the seducing. She was found guilty and sentenced to life in prison.Growing up on the streets of Memphis, Monique Johnson possessed a no- nonsense toughness that made her a perfect fit for her job as a corrections officer. But her job performance wasn\'t the only thing that earned the 40-year-old single mom the admiration of her peers. In 2005, she started dating Memphis police officer Tony Hayes. Hayes, estranged from his third wife, was known as a ladies\' man, a reputation that led to a rocky relationship with Monique. In May of 2006, Hayes had even filed a police report accusing Monique, supposedly angry he\'d gotten a phone call from another woman, of trashing his apartment and scratching obscenities on the hood of his car. But when Hayes disappeared that September, Monique seemed genuinely concerned, afraid her policeman lover had run afoul of some drug-dealer. Three days after Hayes disappeared, it was Monique who handed police a breakthrough - she led them to Tony\'s body, stuffed in the trunk of his white Lexus in a Memphis parking lot. Monique admitted she\'d shot him, but claimed she\'d been defending herself from an abusive boyfriend. But, as investigators looked deeper into Monique\'s background, they uncovered a history of troubled relationships. Charged with first-degree murder, at trial she claimed that, on the day of the murder, she\'d confronted Tony about another woman. They\'d started arguing and he attacked her, backing her into a closet. She\'d grabbed a gun kept there and shot him. Prosecutors argued that it wasn\'t self-defense, because, of 6 shots she fired, four hit him in the back. The jury was unconvinced, however, setting aside first-degree charges and finding Monique guilty of reckless homicide. After sentencing, with credit for time served awaiting trial, she walked away with only probation, but in June 2008, Monique was arrested for violating the terms of her probation. She will be released in May 2009.In 1984, Susan Grund had finally made good. With three failed marriages and a baby on the way, Susan had met and married a fellow native of Peru, Indiana: prosecutor turned defense attorney, James Grund. The 34-year old blond was Jimmy\'s second wife, and, as wife of the prominent attorney, she now hobnobbed with the town\'s social elite -- a far cry from the country upbringing of her childhood. Then, after dark on August 3, 1992, Susan called 911, claiming she had just returned home and found Jimmy on the sofa, with a drop of blood coming from his mouth. He was dead by the time police and EMTs arrived. Detectives found no sign of forced entry, and turned their investigation toward family members after the autopsy showed Jimmy was killed by a 9mm pistol - the same kind of gun that had been stolen from his 18-year-old son David\'s home a month earlier. Jimmy\'s will had also been amended just three weeks earlier to include Susan\'s son, Jacob. David, Susan\'s stepson, told investigators that he\'d shown Susan where he hid the gun when she dropped off the permit to his house. Susan\'s sister, Darlene, came forward less than a month after Jimmy\'s death, claiming that Susan had confessed to the murder. Police set up a wire-tap to try to get her confession recorded, but it failed. But then, the forensics lab came back with results proving it had in fact been David\'s gun that had killed Jimmy. Susan was arrested for her husband\'s murder. About a month before the trial started, Nellie Sanders, Susan\'s mother, contacted police to report a suspicious tub of hers that someone had filled with cement. Underneath, was the 9mm that was used to kill Jim Grund. At the trial, prosecutors claimed Susan killed Jimmy to gain access to his estate, and that all the evidence pointed in her direction. Susan testified in her own defense, and told the jury that she had found the gun at the scene and picked it up. When she realized it had her fingerprints on it, she panicked and hid it. But the widow Grund had more surprises in store for the town of Peru. Susan testified that she was having an affair - with David Grund. She argued that he had killed his father out of jealousy. David denied having a relationship with his stepmother. The jurors, apparently, had their doubts. They deadlocked and Susan was released. Two years later, Susan once again stood trial for the murder of her husband. At the second trial, Susan\'s lawyers advised her not to testify about the alleged affair with her stepson. The strategy turned out to be a mistake. The second jury found her guilty. She was sentenced to 60 years in prison.In the early morning hours of June 6, 2001, 36-year-old casino employee Vol Dooley slipped out the back door of a Shreveport nightclub; it would be the last time he was seen alive in public. The son of a popular former parish sheriff, Vol was trying to avoid trouble with his estranged wife Jocelyn, who had been following him from club to club all evening. After four years and two kids, the Dooleys\' marriage was a signature away from being dissolved, but 31-year-old Jocelyn couldn\'t seem to let Vol go. Their divorce should have been finalized a year earlier, but Jocelyn kept missing the court dates. That didn\'t stop her from getting a new boyfriend, a local bartender named Jeff Kosden. In fact, the day before Vol\'s disappearance, she and Kosden applied for a marriage license. And Jocelyn didn\'t seem to miss Vol after his disappearance - it was his family who reported him missing. Tracing Vol\'s last movements, police quickly discovered that Jocelyn was one of the last people to see and speak to him. When she was questioned, Jocelyn didn\'t deny it, and she even volunteered that she had tried to call him on her cell after leaving the club, but couldn\'t reach him. Detectives discovered Vol\'s truck in a neighboring parish, but found no trace of the missing man. The first break in the case came two weeks later, when one of Jocelyn\'s friends confessed that she had helped Jocelyn and Kosden get rid of Vol\'s body. The friend then led police to the burial site. Both Jocelyn and Kosden were arrested on second-degree murder charges, but when Kosden heard that Jocelyn had met another man, he agreed to testify against her in exchange for a lesser charge. At Jocelyn\'s trial, both her friend and former fianc testified against her, describing in detail how she had called them in the wee hours of the morning, claiming she had shot Vol and needed their help. Jocelyn\'s defense claimed the friend was mentally ill, and Kosden was only testifying to get himself off the hook. Furthermore, according to the defense, forensic evidence pointed in another direction. A tissue with another woman\'s blood had been found at the crime scene. However, the prosecution pointed out that the blood belonged to Vol\'s teenage daughter, who was with her mother the night Vol disappeared. They also pointed out that, according to cell phone records, Jocelyn had lied to police when she said she called Vol the night of his disappearance. When Jocelyn took the stand in her own defense, she told the jury that she was innocent, and that she and Vol were actually reconciling when he disappeared. The jurors didn\'t buy it - it took only two hours for them to return with a guilty verdict. Jocelyn was sentenced to life without parole, and an additional 40 years for obstruction of justice.Adopted as an infant, 17-year-old Nikki Reynolds had a normal, happy childhood: she was active in church and sang in her high school choir. But, according to her adoptive father, Robert Reynolds, things changed in the 10th grade when Nikki began dating Carlos Infante. Both her grades and her relationship with her adoptive parents deteriorated. So did her credibility when, in 1996, Nikki told her parents she\'d been raped by a stranger. The Reynolds immediately reported the incident to police, who determined that the entire thing was a fabrication. Confronted with the findings, Nikki admitted she\'d made the whole thing up because she feared she was pregnant. For the next several months, Nikki and Carlos\' relationship continued on and off until, in May of 1997, the school guidance counselor contacted Billie Jean Reynolds, Nikki\'s adoptive mother, and told her the school was buzzing with rumors that Nikki was pregnant. Mrs. Reynolds scheduled an appointment with the school guidance counselor for the morning of May 15th. She\'d miss the meeting. On the evening of May 14th, not long after her father had left for church, Nikki called 911 and told the dispatcher she\'d just killed her mother. When the cops arrived, they found a trail of blood leading throughout the house and, at its end, Billie Jean dead from multiple stab wounds. Nikki told the police that, shortly after her father left for church, she\'d taken a 14-inch butcher knife and attacked Billie Jean. The two then ran around the house, Nikki stabbing her mother repeatedly until she collapsed. Then, according to Nikki, she\'d asked her dying mother for forgiveness. And, after Billie Jean forgave her, Nikki stabbed her one last time in the chest, ending her agony. Asked why she\'d done it, Nikki told the police \"she must have been crazy.\" She was booked on murder charges. At her first trial, jurors couldn\'t reach a verdict. At her second trial, the defense pled insanity, claiming that Nikki was too emotionally disturbed to have formed clear intent to commit murder. They also claimed Nikki inherited severe depression and psychological problems from her biological mother. Then, to back up the claim, they put Nikki\'s biological mother on the stand to testify in the defense of a daughter she\'d never known. Prosecutors, in closing, contended that Nikki had plotted to kill both her parents, while the defense stressed Nikki\'s disturbed emotional state. In 1999, a second jury found Nikki guilty of 2nd degree murder. The judge sentenced her to 34 years in prison. She\'ll be eligible for parole in 2015.When police officer Wayne Irby didn\'t show up for work on December 10, 2004, a couple of fellow cops went to Wayne\'s home to check on him. Inside, they found Wayne lying dead in his hallway, shot in the head. And on the kitchen counter, they discovered a note from Wayne\'s girlfriend, Denise Miller. The note said, \"I did it. I took our lives.\" But Denise was not lying dead alongside Wayne. In fact, she seemed to have disappeared off the face of the earth. The next day, the front desk at a hotel in another town received a call from a guest, saying she had fallen and needed help. When hotel workers opened the door, they found Denise inside, lying on the floor with two guns nearby. They immediately called police. The cops discovered that Denise had tried to shoot herself in the head. They also discovered a suicide note, in which she confessed to accidentally killing Wayne. Denise was rushed to a hospital, then arrested upon her release 38 days later. Investigators tried to figure out what prompted the shooting, but Denise, now paralyzed on one side, said she couldn\'t remember anything about what happened. Wayne\'s family and friends revealed said Denise was so jealous and possessive that Wayne had decided to end their relationship. At Denise\'s trial, the prosecutor told the jury this was a classic case of \"If I can\'t have you, no one can.\" Jurors didn\'t hear from the wheelchair-bound Denise, since her attorneys said she still had amnesia about the day of the shooting. However, they pointed out that, in her notes, Denise may have admitted to shooting Wayne, but she also said it was accidental. And they said the very fact that she tried to commit suicide proved that she was remorseful. The jury didn\'t buy it. They found her guilty murder, and sentenced her to 62 years.The British public was riveted when 27-year-old Tracie Andrews\' made her television debut. On December 3, 1996, with a bruised and tear-stained face, she appeared at a news conference to describe a road rage attack on her fianc, Lee Harvey, and herself two nights earlier. Tracie described how, as she and Lee were driving home from a local pub, a car came out of nowhere and started following them. When Lee pulled over on the dark country lane, so did the other driver. According to Tracie, a man got out of the other car and began stabbing Lee, punching Tracie when she tried to help. By the time police and emergency workers arrived, the other car was long gone and Lee was dead. Over the next week, police put up roadblocks, stopping over 600 cars and questioning friends, family and potential witnesses. Tracie gained even more sympathy when she was hospitalized after taking an overdose of sleeping pills. But, unbeknownst to the public, the sympathy of the investigators was turning to suspicion. A witness came forward who claimed he had seen Lee and Tracie\'s car on the road just prior to the murder, and that there was no car chasing them. Forensic evidence also seemed to contradict Tracie\'s account. On December 7, Tracie was arrested as she left the hospital and charged with murder. At her trial in July 1997, the jury heard that Lee and Tracie had a history of violent arguments, and that witnesses had heard them fighting earlier on the day Lee was killed. When Tracie took the stand, she adamantly denied killing Lee, and stuck by her road rage story. She didn\'t deny that she and Lee had a volatile relationship, but said they loved each other deeply. She described the ups and downs of the relationship, including an abortion during a breakup, and how Lee bought her breast implants to cheer her up once they reconciled. But the jury weren\'t impressed with her tears or her story. She was found guilty and sentenced to life, with the possibility of parole in 14 years. Two years after her conviction, she admitted she had stabbed Lee, but only after he attacked her. Recently, she has made trips outside of prison, to prepare her for her release in 2011.On the evening of June 10, 2007, the tight-knit community of Darby, Montana, learned that craftsman and builder Bill Stout was dead. Bill\'s wife Anne said she came home from running errands and found her husband\'s bloodied and lifeless body in the couple\'s bed. When police arrived on the scene, they discovered Bill dead from a single gunshot wound to the head. Anne told investigators Bill had no enemies in Darby, but suggested that her husband was the target of a former lover turned stalker. The woman, Barbara Miller, lived in Arkansas. She and Bill had reunited at an old friend\'s wedding, and had a brief fling. But after Bill broke off the relationship, he received a barrage of threatening emails and letters with Barbara\'s signature. It looked like a tragic case of \"Fatal Attraction.\" But as police continued to investigate, their sympathy for Anne turned to suspicion. They found a gun hidden in the saddlebag of Bill\'s motorcycle, and a rubber glove buried in a clothes hamper. Anne claimed she could never harm the father of her two sons, but the Ravalli County Sheriff\'s Office wasn\'t buying it. They arrested Anne, and charged her with her husband\'s murder. Friends and family rallied around Anne, who appeared to be a grief stricken widow. But prosecutors saw no sorrow in Anne\'s eyes. Instead, they uncovered evidence of a person consumed with rage over her husband\'s two-year-old affair with Barbara Miller. And, at trial in the summer of 2008, they presented a chilling case against Anne. There was the murder weapon: Bill\'s handgun that had been reported stolen just weeks before the killing. And, that wasn\'t all. The most damaging evidence showed that Anne tried to frame Bill\'s former mistress Barbara, creating phony emails and letters-and making phone calls from a local pay phone. It was starting to look like an open and shut case against Anne. But the defense argued, if Anne was clever enough to fabricate emails and letters, why did she leave a rubber glove with DNA evidence and the murder weapon at the scene? But jurors weren\'t swayed by the defense argument. Their verdict: guilty. Anne\'s case remains on appeal while she serves a life sentence in the Montana Women\'s Prison, with little chance of parole.Rhonda Glover and Jimmy Joste met in 1989 and there was an immediate attraction between the two. Rhonda was a former beauty queen who had started her own staffing business. Jimmy, 15 years her senior, was a Texas trust fund baby who\'d made millions in the oil industry. It wasn\'t long before the two began dating and moved in together. While the couple was raking in the money hand over fist, they were spending it almost as quickly. Together, the two were high society regulars in the Texas oil crowd. In 1994, the couple had a child together, yet they continued on their wild ride working their way through Jimmy\'s fortune. He bought her a house in Austin, and even once wrote her a check for $1 million to use for spending money. But, life wasn\'t quite the fairytale it appeared for the beauty queen and the oilman. Jimmy had a tendency toward violence when he drank, and Rhonda had erratic mood swings. Together their arguments were legendary, bringing in the police on more than a dozen occasions. But, by the end of 2003, the money was dwindling and the relationship was on the rocks. Even worse, the couple\'s regular fighting and occasional drug use led Rhonda\'s mom to seek and win custody of the couple\'s child. On July 26, 2004, Jimmy was found dead in their Austin home, shot 10 times. Police found casings from a Glock pistol scattered near his body. Had an oil deal gone bad? As police investigated all possibilities they learned about the tumultuous relationship between Jimmy and Rhonda, and discovered Rhonda had recently purchased a Glock 9mm Pistol: the same type of weapon used in the murder. However, when they sought out Rhonda for questioning, she was nowhere to be found. Over the next few days they traced her cell phone records to eventually find her and the couple\'s son in a rented RV in Kansas. Rhonda confessed to killing Jimmy, but insisted she had shot him in self-defense. When the case went to trial, the prosecution claimed that Rhonda had carefully planned and executed the murder, having grown sick of Jimmy after spending all his money, and planning to cash in on a lucrative insurance policy. Rhonda\'s defense, however, argued Rhonda had been a victim of abuse, and finally had fought back. The jury believed the prosecution. They found Rhonda guilty and sentenced her to 46 years in prison.A young widow blames depression, but was her husband\'s death more sinister than a suicide?A Missouri man goes missing, and his ex-wife holds the key to the mystery.A modern-day Romeo and Juliet story has a killer ending.Kelly Ryan and her husband Craig Titus are accused of killing their personal assistant Melissa James in December 2005, then disposing of her body in a burning car in the Las Vegas desert.The premature death of a cancer victim leaves his wife facing lethal injection.A yoga instructor\'s death reveals his girlfriend\'s secret double life.A teen love triangle ends with a missing girl, a dismembered body and three families changed forever in East Moline, IL.A young girl\'s death is complicated by her lesbian lover -- and her lesbian lover\'s husband in Easton, PA.A beautiful young woman is caught on tape plotting to kill her husband -- but was it real or an audition for reality TV?

I hit him in the head.\"\n\nMr Denyer said when he was asked by one officer why he had done it, the boy replied: \"I want to be with my mother.\"\n\nOfficers went straight round to the house.\n\n\"In company with the defendant\'s mother they went to the bedroom on the first floor,\" Mr Denyer said.\n\n\"A chaotic scene developed for understandable reasons as it was clear the baby had been stabbed in his cot and that his hand had been severed.\n\n\"I will not go into the resuscitation attempts that were made, but they were unsuccessful.\"\n\nThe baby was taken to a local children\'s hospital where he was pronounced dead.\n\nThe post mortem examination revealed that the baby had \"some 17 stabs wounds to the face and neck and back\".\n\nThe wounds to the back were all roughly parallel to each other, Mr Denyer said, adding that one had severed the spinal cord.\n\nMr Denyer added: \"The left hand had been severed at its wrist.\n\n\"The wound through the spine would have required a sizeable degree of force, even with a sharp knife.\"\n\nMr Denyer said the mother told police she was downstairs when the baby was stabbed, and that the boy had not been at school that day as she had had an argument with him.\n\n\"She was downstairs dozing on the settee with one of her other young children,\" Mr Denyer said.\n\nThe mother told officers she had put the baby in his cot at about 1pm, then argued with the boy and told him to go upstairs to feed the baby.\n\nMr Denyer said: \"(The boy) went upstairs and (the baby) started crying almost immediately.\n\n\"Five minutes later (the boy) came downstairs and asked her to wash his coat.\n\n\"She noticed that the clothes he had been wearing were now in the wash basket and were subsequently put in the washing machine.\n\n\"The first she knew about the death of (the baby) was when the police arrived at the house.\"\n\nThe boy told police who interviewed that he did not know why he had done it, Mr Denyer said.\n\nThe boy told officers: \"I went to the kitchen downstairs and I got the knife. I went upstairs to the bedroom and I walked to the cot.\n\n\"Then I stabbed (the baby) and I went downstairs, got changed, went out, walked around for a bit and then I came here (the police station).\"\n\nMr Denyer said the boy continued: \"When I got the knife I was thinking to hurt (the baby).\n\n\"I was in the room for a couple of minutes. I was aiming to hurt him. I don\'t know why. I hurt the baby a couple of times.\"\n\nMr Denyer said it was clear the boy had begun to block out the events even by the time of his police interview, the day following the killing.\n\nIt was clear from the baby\'s injuries that the boy stabbed him while he was lying in the cot, and that he had turned him over during the attack.\n\nThe cutting off of the baby\'s hand was also clearly deliberate, Mr Denyer said, adding: \"It clearly required a conscious piece of behaviour on his part.\"\n\nEarlier Mr Denyer told the Judge, Mr Justice Toulson, that the Crown Prosecution Service had considered the boy\'s pleas long and hard before making today\'s decision.\n\nIt was clear the boy was suffering from severe psychiatric disorders, including Asperger Syndrome, and psychiatrists instructed by defence lawyers had concluded that he suffered a \"psychotic shift\" at the time of the killing.\n\nThere was some disagreement between the defence and prosecution experts, he said, but they agreed that, given the circumstances, a jury was unlikely to see the killing as murder rather than manslaughter.\n\nA murder trial was not an option, and if the pleas were not accepted the boy would have to be treated for his illnesses with the threat of the trial hanging over him.\n\nMr Denyer said: \"To deal with him in that sort of way, with a possibility of a trial hanging over his head many years down the line, almost certainly would amount a violation of his human rights.\"','2017-03-25 03:51:14'),(494,65,'7430c3d3b46ca76c4dc61ca5d58074bd0b763aecef58ff97950d7692f532fb88','4aa1b86505bd4047bbc751d40d75264a','','','We are learning more about a woman charged in the stabbing death of her two-month-old son in southeast Houston.A judge read the capital murder charge against Rochelle Brown, 28, overnight.

He served for most of his career as professor of psychiatry at the State University of New York Upstate Medical University in Syracuse, New York.[4] A distinguished lifetime fellow of the American Psychiatric Association and a life member of the American Psychoanalytic Association, he was best known as a social critic of the moral and scientific foundations of psychiatry, as what he saw as the social control aims of medicine in modern society, as well as scientism. His books The Myth of Mental Illness (1961) and The Manufacture of Madness (1970) set out some of the arguments most associated with him.\n\nSzasz argued throughout his career that mental illness is a metaphor for human problems in living, and that mental illnesses are not real in the sense that cancers are real. Except for a few identifiable brain diseases, such as Alzheimer\'s disease, there are neither biological or chemical tests nor biopsy or necropsy findings for verifying or falsifying DSM diagnoses\", i.e., there are no objective methods for detecting the presence or absence of mental illness.[5] Szasz maintained throughout his career that he was not anti-psychiatry but was rather anti-coercive psychiatry. He was a staunch opponent of civil commitment and involuntary psychiatric treatment but believed in, and practiced, psychiatry and psychotherapy between consenting adults.\n\nHis views on special treatment followed from libertarian roots, based on the principles that each person has the right to bodily and mental self-ownership and the right to be free from violence from others, although he criticized the \"Free World\" as well as the communist states for their use of psychiatry.\n\nSzasz was born to Jewish parents Gyula and Lily Szsz on April 15, 1920, in Budapest, Hungary. In 1938, Szasz moved to the United States, where he attended the University of Cincinnati for his Bachelor of Science in physics, and received his M.D. from the same university in 1944.[6] Szasz completed his residency requirement at the Cincinnati General Hospital, then worked at the Chicago Institute for Psychoanalysis from 195156, and then for the next five years was a member of its staff  taking 24 months out for duty with the U.S. Naval Reserve.[7]\n\nIn 1962 Szasz received a tenured position in medicine at the State University of New York.[8] Szasz had first joined SUNY in 1956.\n\nSzasz\'s views of psychiatry were influenced by the writings of Frigyes Karinthy.\n\nSzasz first presented his attack on \"mental illness\" as a legal term in 1958 in the Columbia Law Review. In his article he argued that mental illness was no more a fact bearing on a suspect\'s guilt than is possession by the devil.[8]\n\nIn 1961 Szasz testified before a United States Senate Committee, arguing that using mental hospitals to incarcerate people defined as insane violated the general assumptions of the patient-doctor relationship, and turned the doctor into a warden and keeper of a prison.[8]\n\nSzasz was convinced there was a metaphorical character to mental disorders, and its uses in psychiatry were frequently injurious. He set himself a task to delegitimize legitimating agencies and authorities, and what he saw as their vast powers, enforced by psychiatrists and other mental health professionals, mental health laws, mental health courts, and mental health sentences.[9]:22\n\nSzasz was a critic of the influence of modern medicine on society, which he considered to be the secularisation of religion\'s hold on humankind. Criticizing scientism, he targeted psychiatry in particular, underscoring its campaigns against masturbation at the end of the 19th century, its use of medical imagery and language to describe misbehavior, its reliance on involuntary mental hospitalization to protect society, and the use of lobotomy and other interventions to treat psychosis. To sum up his description of the political influence of medicine in modern societies imbued by faith in science, he declared:\n\nSzasz consistently paid attention to the power of language in the establishment and maintenance of the social order, both in small interpersonal and in wider social, economic, and/or political spheres:\n\nHis main arguments can be summarized as follows:\n\n\"Mental illness\" is an expression, a metaphor that describes an offending, disturbing, shocking, or vexing conduct, action, or pattern of behavior, such as schizophrenia, as an \"illness\" or \"disease\". Szasz wrote: \"If you talk to God, you are praying; If God talks to you, you have schizophrenia. If the dead talk to you, you are a spiritualist; If you talk to the dead, you are a schizophrenic.\"[11][pageneeded] He maintained that, while people behave and think in disturbing ways, and those ways may resemble a disease process (pain, deterioration, response to various interventions), this does not mean they actually have a disease. To Szasz, disease can only mean something people \"have\", while behavior is what people \"do\". Diseases are \"malfunctions of the human body, of the heart, the liver, the kidney, the brain\" while \"no behavior or misbehavior is a disease or can be a disease. That\'s not what diseases are.\" Szasz cited drapetomania as an example of a behavior that many in society did not approve of, being labeled and widely cited as a disease. Likewise, women who did not bend to a man\'s will were said to have hysteria.[12] He thought that psychiatry actively obscures the difference between behavior and disease in its quest to help or harm parties in conflicts. He maintained that, by calling people diseased, psychiatry attempts to deny them responsibility as moral agents in order to better control them.\n\nIn Szasz\'s view, people who are said by themselves or others to have a mental illness can only have, at best, a \"fake disease\". Diagnoses of \"mental illness\" or \"mental disorder\" (the latter expression called by Szasz a \"weasel term\" for mental illness) are passed off as \"scientific categories\" but they remain merely judgments (judgments of disdain) to support certain uses of power by psychiatric authorities. In that line of thinking, schizophrenia is not the name of a disease entity but a judgment of extreme psychiatric and social reprobation. Szasz called schizophrenia \"the sacred symbol of psychiatry\" because those so labeled have long provided and continue to provide justification for psychiatric theories, treatments, abuses, and reforms.\n\nThe figure of the psychotic or schizophrenic person to psychiatric experts and authorities, according to Szasz, is analogous with the figure of the heretic or blasphemer to theological experts and authorities. According to Szasz, to understand the metaphorical nature of the term \"disease\" in psychiatry, one must first understand its literal meaning in the rest of medicine. To be a true disease, the entity must first, somehow be capable of being approached, measured, or tested in scientific fashion. Second, to be confirmed as a disease, a condition must demonstrate pathology at the cellular or molecular level.\n\nA genuine disease must also be found on the autopsy table (not merely in the living person) and meet pathological definition instead of being voted into existence by members of the American Psychiatric Association. \"Mental illnesses\" are really problems in living. They are often \"like a\" disease, argued Szasz, which makes the medical metaphor understandable, but in no way validates it as an accurate description or explanation. Psychiatry is a pseudoscience that parodies medicine by using medical-sounding words invented especially over the last one hundred years. To be clear, heart break and heart attack, or spring fever and typhoid fever belong to two completely different logical categories, and treating one as the other constitutes a category error. Psychiatrists are the successors of \"soul doctors\", priests who dealt and deal with the spiritual conundrums, dilemmas, and vexations  the \"problems in living\"  that have troubled people forever.\n\nPsychiatry\'s main methods are those of conversation or rhetoric, repression, and religion. To the extent that psychiatry presents these problems as \"medical diseases\", its methods as \"medical treatments\", and its clients  especially involuntary  as medically ill patients, it embodies a lie and therefore constitutes a fundamental threat to freedom and dignity. Psychiatry, supported by the State through various Mental Health Acts, has become a modern secular state religion according to Szasz. It is a vastly elaborate social control system, using both brute force and subtle indoctrination, which disguises itself under the claims of scientificity.\n\nAccording to Szasz, many people fake their presentation of mental illness, i.e., they are malingering. They do so for gain, for example, in order to escape a burden like evading the draft, or to gain access to drugs or financial support, or for some other personally meaningful reason. By definition, the malingerer is knowingly deceitful (although malingering itself has also been called a mental illness or disorder). Szasz mentions malingering in many of his works, but it is not what he has in mind to explain many other manifestations of so-called mental illness. In those cases, so-called patients have something personally significant to communicate  their \"problems in living\"  but unable to express this via conventional means they resort to illness-imitation behaviour, a somatic protolanguage or \"body language\", which psychiatrists and psychologists have misguidedly interpreted as the signs/symptoms of real illness.[13] So, for example, \"analyzing the origin of the hysterical protolanguage Szasz states that it has a double origin: - the first root is in the somatic structure of human being. The human body is subject to illnesses and disabilities expressed through somatic signs (like paralysis, convulsions, etc.) and somatic sensations (like pain, tiredness, etc.); - the second root can be found into cultural factors.\"[14]\n\nIf we accept that \"mental illness\" is a euphemism for behaviors that are disapproved of, then the state has no right to force psychiatric \"treatment\" on these individuals. Similarly, the state should not be able to interfere in mental health practices between consenting adults (for example, by legally controlling the supply of psychotropic drugs or psychiatric medication). The medicalization of government produces a \"therapeutic state\", designating someone as, for example, \"insane\" or as a \"drug addict\".\n\nIn Ceremonial Chemistry (1973), he argued that the same persecution that targeted witches, Jews, Gypsies, and homosexuals now targets \"drug addicts\" and \"insane\" people. Szasz argued that all these categories of people were taken as scapegoats of the community in ritual ceremonies. To underscore this continuation of religion through medicine, he even takes as example obesity: instead of concentrating on junk food (ill-nutrition), physicians denounced hypernutrition. According to Szasz, despite their scientific appearance, the diets imposed were a moral substitute to the former fasts, and the social injunction not to be overweight is to be considered as a moral order, not as a scientific advice as it claims to be. As with those thought bad (insane people), and those who took the wrong drugs (drug addicts), medicine created a category for those who had the wrong weight (obesity).\n\nSzasz argued that psychiatrics were created in the 17th century to study and control those who erred from the medical norms of social behavior; a new specialization, drogophobia, was created in the 20th century to study and control those who erred from the medical norms of drug consumption; and then, in the 1960s, another specialization, bariatrics, was created to deal with those who erred from the medical norms concerning the weight the body should have. Thus, he underscores that in 1970, the American Society of Bariatic Physicians (from the Greek baros, for \"weight\") had 30 members, and already 450 two years later.\n\nJust as legal systems work on the presumption that a person is innocent until proven guilty, individuals accused of crimes should not be presumed incompetent simply because a doctor or psychiatrist labels them as such. Mental incompetence should be assessed like any other form of incompetence, i.e., by purely legal and judicial means with the right of representation and appeal by the accused.\n\nIn an analogy to birth control, Szasz argued that individuals should be able to choose when to die without interference from medicine or the state, just as they are able to choose when to conceive without outside interference. He considered suicide to be among the most fundamental rights, but he opposed state-sanctioned euthanasia. In his 2006 book about Virginia Woolf he stated that she put an end to her life by a conscious and deliberate act, her suicide being an expression of her freedom of choice.[15][16]\n\nSzasz believed that testimony about the mental competence of a defendant should not be admissible in trials. Psychiatrists testifying about the mental state of an accused person\'s mind have about as much business as a priest testifying about the religious state of a person\'s soul in our courts. Insanity was a legal tactic invented to circumvent the punishments of the Church, which at the time included confiscation of the property of those who committed suicide, often leaving widows and orphans destitute. Only an insane person would do such a thing to his widow and children, it was successfully argued. This is legal mercy masquerading as medicine, according to Szasz.\n\nNo one should be deprived of liberty unless he is found guilty of a criminal offense. Depriving a person of liberty for what is said to be his own good is immoral. Just as a person suffering from terminal cancer may refuse treatment, so should a person be able to refuse psychiatric treatment.\n\nDrug addiction is not a \"disease\" to be cured through legal drugs but a social habit. Szasz also argues in favor of a free market for drugs. He criticized the war on drugs, arguing that using drugs is in fact a victimless crime. Prohibition itself constituted the crime. He argued that the war on drugs leads states to do things that would have never been considered half a century before, such as prohibiting a person from ingesting certain substances or interfering in other countries to impede the production of certain plants, e.g. coca eradication plans, or the campaigns against opium; both are traditional plants opposed by the Western world. Although Szasz was skeptical about the merits of psychotropic medications, he favored the repeal of drug prohibition.[citation needed]\n\nSzasz also drew analogies between the persecution of the drug-using minority and the persecution of Jewish and homosexual minorities.\n\nSzasz cites former U.S. Representative James M. Hanley\'s reference to drug users as \"vermin\", using \"the same metaphor for condemning persons who use or sell illegal drugs that the Nazis used to justify murdering Jews by poison gas  namely, that the persecuted persons are not human beings, but \'vermin.\'\"[18]\n\nThe \"Therapeutic State\" is a phrase coined by Szasz in 1963.[19] The collaboration between psychiatry and government leads to what Szasz calls the therapeutic state, a system in which disapproved actions, thoughts, and emotions are repressed (\"cured\") through pseudomedical interventions.[20][21]:17 Thus suicide, unconventional religious beliefs, racial bigotry, unhappiness, anxiety, shyness, sexual promiscuity, shoplifting, gambling, overeating, smoking, and illegal drug use are all considered symptoms or illnesses that need to be cured.[21]:17 When faced with demands for measures to curtail smoking in public, binge-drinking, gambling or obesity, ministers say that \"we must guard against charges of nanny statism.\"[22] The \"nanny state\" has turned into the \"therapeutic state\" where nanny has given way to counselor.[22] Nanny just told people what to do; counselors also tell them what to think and what to feel.[22] The \"nanny state\" was punitive, austere, and authoritarian, the therapeutic state is touchy-feely, supportive  and even more authoritarian.[22]\n\nAccording to Szasz, \"the therapeutic state swallows up everything human on the seemingly rational ground that nothing falls outside the province of health and medicine, just as the theological state had swallowed up everything human on the perfectly rational ground that nothing falls outside the province of God and religion.\"[23]:515 Faced with the problem of \"madness\", Western individualism proved to be ill-prepared to defend the rights of the individual: modern man has no more right to be a madman than medieval man had a right to be a heretic because if once people agree that they have identified the one true God, or Good, it brings about that they have to guard members and nonmembers of the group from the temptation to worship false gods or goods.[23]:496 A secularization of God and the medicalization of good resulted in the post-Enlightenment version of this view: once people agree that they have identified the one true reason, it brings about that they have to guard against the temptation to worship unreason  that is, madness.[23]:496\n\nCivil libertarians warn that the marriage of the State with psychiatry could have catastrophic consequences for civilization.[24] In the same vein as the separation of church and state, Szasz believes that a solid wall must exist between psychiatry and the State.[23]\n\nBelieving that psychiatric hospitals are like prisons not hospitals and that psychiatrists who subject others to coercion function as judges and jailers not physicians,[25] Szasz made efforts to abolish involuntary psychiatric hospitalization for over two decades, and in 1970 took a part in founding the American Association for the Abolition of Involuntary Mental Hospitalization (AAAIMH).[26] Its founding was announced by Szasz in 1971 in the American Journal of Psychiatry[27] and American Journal of Public Health.[28] The association provided legal help to psychiatric patients and published a journal, The Abolitionist.[29]\n\nIn 1969, Szasz and the Church of Scientology co-founded the Citizens Commission on Human Rights (CCHR) to oppose involuntary psychiatric treatments. Szasz served on CCHR\'s Board of Advisors as Founding Commissioner.[30] In the keynote address at the 25th anniversary of CCHR, Szasz stated, \"We should all honor CCHR because it is really the organization that for the first time in human history has organized a politically, socially, internationally significant voice to combat psychiatry. This has never been done in human history before.\"[31]\n\nIn a 2009 interview aired by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, Szasz explained his reason for collaborating with CCHR and lack of involvement with Scientology:\n\nSzasz was a strong critic of institutional psychiatry and his publications were very widely read. He argued that so-called mental illnesses had no underlying physiological basis, but were unwanted and unpleasant behaviors. Mental illness, he said was only a metaphor that described problems that people faced in their daily lives, labeled as if they were medical diseases. Szasz\'s ideas had little influence on mainstream psychiatry but were supported by some behaviorial and social scientists. Sociologist Erving Goffman, who wrote Asylums, was skeptical about psychiatric practices. He was concerned that the stigma and social rejection associated with psychiatric treatment might harm people. Thomas Scheff, also a sociologist, had similar reservations.[33]\n\nIn the summer of 2001, Szasz took a part in a Russell Tribunal on Human rights in Psychiatry held in Berlin between June 30 and July 2, 2001.[34] The tribunal brought in the two following verdicts: the majority verdict claimed that there was \"serious abuse of human rights in psychiatry\" and that psychiatry was \"guilty of the combination of force and unaccountability\"; the minority verdict, signed by the Israeli Law Professor Alon Harel and Brazilian novelist Paulo Coelho, called for \"public critical examination of the role of psychiatry\".[34]\n\nSzasz was honored with over fifty awards including:[3]\n\nRobert Evan Kendell presents (in Schaler, 2005[37]) a critique of Szasz\'s conception of disease and the contention that mental illness is \"mythical\" as presented in The Myth of Mental Illness. Kendell\'s arguments include the following:\n\nShorter[38] replied to Szasz\'s essay \"The myth of mental illness: 50 years later\",[39] which was published in journal The Psychiatrist (and delivered as a plenary address at the International Congress of the Royal College of Psychiatrists in Edinburgh on 24 June 2010)  in recognition of the 50th anniversary of The Myth of Mental Illness  with the following principal criticisms:','2017-03-25 03:51:14'),(499,66,'794fe8f77cedefd2077d3d8c7bf8a94ef290b24622411171214d09cb0792538a','036da0dd27514143921a2f576fd57778','','','This page includes quotations from all the Dune novels  both those by Frank Herbert and authorized works in the Dune universe written by others.\n\nA sophisticated human can become primitive.

The chamber was stocked with books, cots to sleep on but no bedding, running water and toilet, and enough dried food to last all five for over a month.\n\nThe test subjects were political prisoners deemed enemies of the state during World War II.\n\nEverything was fine for the first five days; the subjects hardly complained having been promised (falsely) that they would be freed if they submitted to the test and did not sleep for 30 days. Their conversations and activities were monitored and it was noted that they continued to talk about increasingly traumatic incidents in their past, and the general tone of their conversations took on a darker aspect after the four day mark.\n\nAfter five days they started to complain about the circumstances and events that lead them to where they were and started to demonstrate severe paranoia. They stopped talking to each other and began alternately whispering to the microphones and one way mirrored portholes. Oddly they all seemed to think they could win the trust of the experimenters by turning over their comrades, the other subjects in captivity with them. At first the researchers suspected this was an effect of the gas itself...\n\nAfter nine days the first of them started screaming. He ran the length of the chamber repeatedly yelling at the top of his lungs for three hours straight, he continued attempting to scream but was only able to produce occasional squeaks. The researchers postulated that he had physically torn his vocal cords. The most surprising thing about this behavior is how the other captives reacted to it... or rather didn\'t react to it. They continued whispering to the microphones until the second of the captives started to scream. The two non-screaming captives took the books apart, smeared page after page with their own feces and pasted them calmly over the glass portholes. The screaming promptly stopped.\n\nSo did the whispering to the microphones.\n\nAfter three more days passed. The researchers checked the microphones hourly to make sure they were working, since they thought it impossible that no sound could be coming with five people inside. The oxygen consumption in the chamber indicated that all five must still be alive. In fact it was the amount of oxygen five people would consume at a very heavy level of strenuous exercise. On the morning of the 14th day the researchers did something they said they would not do to get a reaction from the captives, they used the intercom inside the chamber, hoping to provoke any response from the captives they were afraid were either dead or vegetables.\n\nThey announced: \"We are opening the chamber to test the microphones; step away from the door and lie flat on the floor or you will be shot. Compliance will earn one of you your immediate freedom.\"\n\nTo their surprise they heard a single phrase in a calm voice response: \"We no longer want to be freed.\"\n\nDebate broke out among the researchers and the military forces funding the research. Unable to provoke any more response using the intercom it was finally decided to open the chamber at midnight on the fifteenth day.\n\nThe chamber was flushed of the stimulant gas and filled with fresh air and immediately voices from the microphones began to object. 3 different voices began begging, as if pleading for the life of loved ones to turn the gas back on. The chamber was opened and soldiers sent in to retrieve the test subjects. They began to scream louder than ever, and so did the soldiers when they saw what was inside. Four of the five subjects were still alive, although no one could rightly call the state that any of them in \'life.\'\n\nThe food rations past day five had not been so much as touched. There were chunks of meat from the dead test subject\'s thighs and chest stuffed into the drain in the center of the chamber, blocking the drain and allowing four inches of water to accumulate on the floor. Precisely how much of the water on the floor was actually blood was never determined. All four \'surviving\' test subjects also had large portions of muscle and skin torn away from their bodies. The destruction of flesh and exposed bone on their finger tips indicated that the wounds were inflicted by hand, not with teeth as the researchers initially thought. Closer examination of the position and angles of the wounds indicated that most if not all of them were self-inflicted.\n\nThe abdominal organs below the ribcage of all four test subjects had been removed. While the heart, lungs and diaphragm remained in place, the skin and most of the muscles attached to the ribs had been ripped off, exposing the lungs through the ribcage. All the blood vessels and organs remained intact, they had just been taken out and laid on the floor, fanning out around the eviscerated but still living bodies of the subjects. The digestive tract of all four could be seen to be working, digesting food. It quickly became apparent that what they were digesting was their own flesh that they had ripped off and eaten over the course of days.\n\nMost of the soldiers were Russian special operatives at the facility, but still many refused to return to the chamber to remove the test subjects. They continued to scream to be left in the chamber and alternately begged and demanded that the gas be turned back on, lest they fall asleep...\n\nTo everyone\'s surprise the test subjects put up a fierce fight in the process of being removed from the chamber. One of the Russian soldiers died from having his throat ripped out, another was gravely injured by having his testicles ripped off and an artery in his leg severed by one of the subject\'s teeth. Another 5 of the soldiers lost their lives if you count ones that committed suicide in the weeks following the incident.\n\nIn the struggle one of the four living subjects had his spleen ruptured and he bled out almost immediately. The medical researchers attempted to sedate him but this proved impossible. He was injected with more than ten times the human dose of a morphine derivative and still fought like a cornered animal, breaking the ribs and arm of one doctor. When heart was seen to beat for a full two minutes after he had bled out to the point there was more air in his vascular system than blood. Even after it stopped he continued to scream and flail for another three minutes, struggling to attack anyone in reach and just repeating the word \"MORE\" over and over, weaker and weaker, until he finally fell silent.\n\nThe surviving three test subjects were heavily restrained and moved to a medical facility, the two with intact vocal cords continuously begging for the gas demanding to be kept awake...\n\nThe most injured of the three was taken to the only surgical operating room that the facility had. In the process of preparing the subject to have his organs placed back within his body it was found that he was effectively immune to the sedative they had given him to prepare him for the surgery. He fought furiously against his restraints when the anesthetic gas was brought out to put him under. He managed to tear most of the way through a four inch wide leather strap on one wrist, even through the weight of a 200 pound soldier holding that wrist as well. It took only a little more anesthetic than normal to put him under, and the instant his eyelids fluttered and closed, his heart stopped. In the autopsy of the test subject that died on the operating table it was found that his blood had triple the normal level of oxygen. His muscles that were still attached to his skeleton were badly torn and he had broken 9 bones in his struggle to not be subdued. Most of them were from the force his own muscles had exerted on them.\n\nThe second survivor had been the first of the group of five to start screaming. His vocal cords destroyed he was unable to beg or object to surgery, and he only reacted by shaking his head violently in disapproval when the anesthetic gas was brought near him. He shook his head yes when someone suggested, reluctantly, they try the surgery without anesthetic, and did not react for the entire six hour procedure of replacing his abdominal organs and attempting to cover them with what remained of his skin. The surgeon presiding stated repeatedly that it should be medically possible for the patient to still be alive. One terrified nurse assisting the surgery stated that she had seen the patients mouth curl into a smile several times, whenever his eyes met hers.\n\nWhen the surgery ended the subject looked at the surgeon and began to wheeze loudly, attempting to talk while struggling. Assuming this must be something of drastic importance the surgeon had a pen and pad fetched so the patient could write his message. It was simple. \"Keep cutting.\"\n\nThe other two test subjects were given the same surgery, both without anesthetic as well. Although they had to be injected with a paralytic for the duration of the operation. The surgeon found it impossible to perform the operation while the patients laughed continuously. Once paralyzed the subjects could only follow the attending researchers with their eyes. The paralytic cleared their system in an abnormally short period of time and they were soon trying to escape their bonds. The moment they could speak they were again asking for the stimulant gas. The researchers tried asking why they had injured themselves, why they had ripped out their own guts and why they wanted to be given the gas again.\n\nOnly one response was given: \"I must remain awake.\"\n\nAll three subject\'s restraints were reinforced and they were placed back into the chamber awaiting determination as to what should be done with them. The researchers, facing the wrath of their military \'benefactors\' for having failed the stated goals of their project considered euthanizing the surviving subjects. The commanding officer, an ex-KGB instead saw potential, and wanted to see what would happen if they were put back on the gas. The researchers strongly objected, but were overruled.\n\nIn preparation for being sealed in the chamber again the subjects were connected to an EEG monitor and had their restraints padded for long term confinement. To everyone\'s surprise all three stopped struggling the moment it was let slip that they were going back on the gas. It was obvious that at this point all three were putting up a great struggle to stay awake. One of subjects that could speak was humming loudly and continuously; the mute subject was straining his legs against the leather bonds with all his might, first left, then right, then left again for something to focus on. The remaining subject was holding his head off his pillow and blinking rapidly. Having been the first to be wired for EEG most of the researchers were monitoring his brain waves in surprise. They were normal most of the time but sometimes flat lined inexplicably. It looked as if he were repeatedly suffering brain death, before returning to normal. As they focused on paper scrolling out of the brainwave monitor only one nurse saw his eyes slip shut at the same moment his head hit the pillow. His brainwaves immediately changed to that of deep sleep, then flatlined for the last time as his heart simultaneously stopped.\n\nThe only remaining subject that could speak started screaming to be sealed in now. His brainwaves showed the same flatlines as one who had just died from falling asleep. The commander gave the order to seal the chamber with both subjects inside, as well as three researchers. One of the named three immediately drew his gun and shot the commander point blank between the eyes, then turned the gun on the mute subject and blew his brains out as well.\n\nHe pointed his gun at the remaining subject, still restrained to a bed as the remaining members of the medical and research team fled the room. \"I won\'t be locked in here with these things! Not with you!\" he screamed at the man strapped to the table. \"WHAT ARE YOU?\" he demanded. \"I must know!\"\n\n\"Have you forgotten so easily?\" the subject asked. \"We are you. We are the madness that lurks within you all, begging to be free at every moment in your deepest animal mind. We are what you hide from in your beds every night. We are what you sedate into silence and paralysis when you go to the nocturnal haven where we cannot tread.\"\n\nThe researcher paused. Then aimed at the subject\'s heart and fired. The EEG flatlined as the subject weakly choked out, \"So... nearly... free...\"','2017-03-25 03:51:14'),(501,66,'794fe8f77cedefd2077d3d8c7bf8a94ef290b24622411171214d09cb0792538a','adc949fb3352401389a9214cb622bac6','','','I just read of a rather disturbing experiment that I felt had the ring of BS to it. Here\'s the article:\n\n\n\n\"In 1983, a team of deeply pious scientists conducted a radical experiment in an undisclosed facility. The scientists had theorized that a human without access to any senses or ways to perceive stimuli would be able to perceive the presence of God. They believed that the five senses clouded our awareness of eternity, and without them, a human could actually establish contact with God by thought. An elderly man who claimed to have nothing left to live for was the only test subject to volunteer. To purge him of all his senses, the scientists performed a complex operation in which every sensory nerve connection to the brain was surgically severed. Although the test subject retained full muscular function, he could not see, hear, taste, smell, or feel. With no possible way to communicate with or even sense the outside world, he was alone with his thoughts.\n\n\n\nScientists monitored him as he spoke aloud about his state of mind in jumbled, slurred sentences that he couldnt even hear. After four days, the man claimed to be hearing hushed, unintelligible voices in his head. Assuming it was an onset of psychosis, the scientists paid little attention to the mans concerns.\n\n\n\nTwo days later, the man cried that he could hear his dead wife speaking with him, and even more, he could communicate back. The scientists were intrigued, but were not convinced until the subject started naming dead relatives of the scientists. He repeated personal information to the scientists that only their dead spouses and parents would have known. At this point, a sizable portion of scientists left the study.\n\n\n\nAfter a week of conversing with the deceased through his thoughts, the subject became distressed, saying the voices were overwhelming. In every waking moment, his consciousness was bombarded by hundreds of voices that refused to leave him alone. He frequently threw himself against the wall, trying to elicit a pain response. He begged the scientists for sedatives, so he could escape the voices by sleeping. This tactic worked for three days, until he started having severe night terrors. The subject repeatedly said that he could see and hear the deceased in his dreams.\n\n\n\nOnly a day later, the subject began to scream and claw at his non-functional eyes, hoping to sense something in the physical world. The hysterical subject now said the voices of the dead were deafening and hostile, speaking of hell and the end of the world. At one point, he yelled No heaven, no forgiveness for five hours straight. He continually begged to be killed, but the scientists were convinced that he was close to establishing contact with God.\n\n\n\nAfter another day, the subject could no longer form coherent sentences. Seemingly mad, he started to bite off chunks of flesh from his arm. The scientists rushed into the test chamber and restrained him to a table so he could not kill himself. After a few hours of being tied down, the subject halted his struggling and screaming. He stared blankly at the ceiling as teardrops silently streaked across his face. For two weeks, the subject had to be manually rehydrated due to the constant crying. Eventually, he turned his head and, despite his blindness, made focused eye contact with a scientist for the first time in the study. He whispered I have spoken with God, and he has abandoned us and his vital signs stopped. There was no apparent cause of death.\"\n\n\n\nNow its not that I doubt that some secret agency could/would do something like that, it just seems that by 1983, they would\'ve been aware of the use of sensory deprivation tanks and been able to achieve the same results without the permanent surgery. Furthermore the story gives no details on who,what, when or where this experiment was done, so to me, it sounds like another urban legend that fundamentalist preachers could spout from the pulpit at altar call time. Anyone got anymore info on this? Such as where this story may have originated?','2017-03-25 03:51:14'),(502,66,'794fe8f77cedefd2077d3d8c7bf8a94ef290b24622411171214d09cb0792538a','daa15d61d8d84222a952154f4c8c0524','','','Sensory deprivation (Sendep) or perceptual isolation[1] is the deliberate reduction or removal of stimuli from one or more of the senses. Simple devices such as blindfolds or hoods and earmuffs can cut off sight and hearing, while more complex devices can also cut off the sense of smell, touch, taste, thermoception (heat-sense), and \'gravity\'. Sensory deprivation has been used in various alternative medicines and in psychological experiments (e.g. with an isolation tank).\n\nShort-term sessions of sensory deprivation are described as relaxing and conducive to meditation; however, extended or forced sensory deprivation can result in extreme anxiety, hallucinations,[2] bizarre thoughts, and depression.[3]\n\nA related phenomenon is perceptual deprivation, also called the ganzfeld effect. In this case a constant uniform stimulus is used instead of attempting to remove the stimuli; this leads to effects which have similarities to sensory deprivation.[4]\n\nSensory deprivation techniques were developed by some of the armed forces within NATO, as a means of interrogating prisoners within international treaty obligations.[5] The European Court of Human Rights ruled that the use of the five techniques by British security forces in Northern Ireland amounted to a practice of inhumane and degrading treatment.\n\nThere are two basic methods of restricted environmental stimulation therapy (REST): chamber REST and flotation REST.\n\nIn chamber REST, the subject lies on a bed in a completely dark and sound reducing (on average, 80dB) room for up to 24 hours. Their movement is restricted by the experimental instructions, but not by any mechanical restraints. Food, drink and toilet facilities are provided in the room and are at the discretion of the tester. Subjects are allowed to leave the room before the 24 hours are complete; however, fewer than 10% actually do.[6]\n\nIn flotation REST, the room contains a tank or pool. The flotation medium consists of a skin-temperature solution of water and Epsom salts at a specific gravity that allows for the patient to float supine without worry of safety. In fact, to turn over while in the solution requires \"major deliberate effort.\" Fewer than 5% of the subjects tested leave before the session duration ends, which is usually around an hour for flotation REST.[6]\n\nFor the first 40 minutes, it is reportedly possible to experience itching in various parts of the body (a phenomenon also reported to be common during the early stages of meditation). The last 20 minutes often end with a transition from beta or alpha brainwaves to theta, which typically occur briefly before sleep and again at waking. In a float tank, the theta state can last for several minutes without the subject losing consciousness. Some use the extended theta state as a tool for enhanced creativity and problem solving. Spas sometimes provide commercial float tanks for use in relaxation. Flotation therapy has been academically studied in the US and in Sweden with published results showing reductions of both pain and stress.[7] The relaxed state also involves lowered blood pressure and maximal blood flow.\n\nSeveral differences exist between flotation and chamber REST. For example, with the presence of a medium in flotation REST, the subject has reduced tactile stimulation while experiencing weightlessness. The addition of Epsom salts to attain the desired specific gravity may have a therapeutic effect on hypertonic muscles. Since one of the main effects of chamber REST is the resulting state of relaxation, the effects of chamber REST on arousal are less clear-cut, which can be attributed to the nature of the solution.[8]\n\nAlso, due to the inherent immobilization that is experienced in flotation REST (by not being able to roll over), which can become uncomfortable after several hours, the subject is unable to experience the session durations of chamber REST. This may not allow the subject to experience the changes in attitudes and thinking that are associated with chamber REST[9] .\n\nAdditionally, the research questions asked between each technique are different. Chamber REST questions stemmed from research that began in the 1950s and explored a variety of questions about the need for stimulation, nature of arousal and its relationship with external stimulation. Practitioners in this area have explored its utility in the treatment of major psychiatric dysfunctions such as autism and substance abuse. On the contrary, flotation REST was seen as more of a recreational tool as it was tested more for its use with stress-related disorders, pain reduction and insomnia.[6]\n\nNumerous studies have debated which method is a more effective treatment process, however, only one has explored this statistically. Nineteen subjects, all of whom used chamber or flotation REST to induce relaxation or treat smoking, obesity, alcohol intake or chronic pain were analyzed. The statistic of interest, d, is a measure of the size of the treatment effect. For reference, d=0.5 is considered a moderate effect and d=0.8 a large effect. The 19 subjects who underwent chamber REST had d=0.53 and six flotation REST subjects showed d=0.33. Additionally, when examining subjects undergoing REST treatment and REST in conjunction with another treatment method, there was little difference.[10]\n\nThe use of REST has been explored in aiding in the cessation of smoking. In studies ranging between 12 months and five years, 25% of REST patients achieved long-term abstinence. REST, when combined with other effective smoking cessation methods (for example: behavior modification), resulted in long-term abstinence of 50%. Also, when combined with weekly support groups, REST resulted in 80% of patients achieving long-term abstinence. Comparatively, the use of a nicotine patch alone has a success rate of 5%.[11]\n\nAlcoholism has also been the target of research associated with REST. In conjunction with anti-alcohol educational messages, patients who underwent two hours of REST treatment reduced alcohol consumption by 56% in the first two weeks after treatment. The reduction in consumption was maintained during follow-ups conducted three and six months after the first treatment. It is, however, possible that this is caused by the placebo effect.\n\nIn addition, REST has been tested to determine its effect on users of other drugs. A University of Arizona study used chamber REST as a complement to traditional outpatient substance abuse treatment and found that 43% of the patients after four years continued to be sober and drug-free. No one in the control group remained clean after eight months.[12]\n\nStudies have been conducted to test the effect of sensory deprivation on the brain. One study took 19 volunteers, all of whom tested in the lower and upper 20th percentiles on a questionnaire which measures the tendency of healthy people to see things not really there, and placed them into a pitch black, soundproof booth for 15 minutes. After, they completed another test that measures psychosis-like experiences, originally used to study recreational drug users. Five people reported seeing hallucinations of faces, six reported seeing shapes/faces not actually there, four noted a heightened sense of smell and two people reported sensing a \"presence of evil\" in the room. People who scored lower on the first test experienced fewer perceptual distortions; however, they still reported seeing a variety of delusions and hallucinations.\n\nAccording to a 2009 study published in the Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease, the hallucinations are caused by the brain misidentifying the source of what it is currently experiencing, a phenomenon called faulty source monitoring.[13]\n\nThe five techniques of wall-standing; hooding; subjection to noise; deprivation of sleep; deprivation of food and drink were used by the security forces in Northern Ireland in the early 1970s. After the Parker Report of 1972, these techniques were formally abandoned by the United Kingdom as aids to the interrogation of paramilitary suspects.\n\nThe Irish government on behalf of the men who had been subject to the five methods took a case to the European Commission of Human Rights (Ireland v. United Kingdom, 1976 Y.B. Eur. Conv. on Hum. Rts. 512, 748, 788-94 (European Commission of Human Rights)). The Commission stated that it \"considered the combined use of the five methods to amount to torture.\"[14][15] This consideration was overturned on appeal, when in 1978 the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) examined the United Nations\' definition of torture. The court subsequently ruled that the five techniques \"did not occasion suffering of the particular intensity and cruelty implied by the word torture,\" however they did amount \"to a practice of inhuman and degrading treatment,\" which is a breach of the European Convention on Human Rights, Article 3.[16]\n\nIt their judgment[17] the court states that:\n\nJos Padilla, a United States citizen from Brooklyn, New York, was convicted in federal court of aiding terrorists in 2007 and was sentenced to 17 years and 4 months in prison. While awaiting trial, reports surfaced that he was being tortured for information with the use of sensory deprivation for weeks at a time. For 1,307 days, Padilla was kept in a 9\' x 7\' cell with no natural light, clock or calendar. When Padilla left his cell, he was shackled and fitted with heavy goggles and headphones. His counsel argues that while he was being interrogated Padilla was subjected to harsh lights and pounding sounds. While meeting with his counsel, they reported Padilla exhibiting facial tics, random eye movements and unusual contortions of his body. According to them, Padilla had become so \"shattered\" that he became convinced his lawyers were part of a continuing interrogation program and saw his captors as protectors.[13]\n\nIn January 2008, the BBC aired a Horizon special entitled \"Total Isolation\". The premise of the show centered on six individuals, four men and two women, agreeing to be shut in a cell inside a nuclear bunker, alone and in complete darkness for 48 hours. Prior to isolation, the volunteers underwent tests of visual memory, information processing, verbal fluency and suggestibility.\n\nAfter the two days and two nights the subjects noted that their inability to sense time, as well as hallucinations, made the experience difficult. Of the six volunteers, three experienced auditory and visual hallucinationssnakes, oysters, tiny cars and zebras. One was convinced their sheets were wet. Two seemed to cope well.\n\nWhen complete, the tests that the subjects took before the experiment were conducted a second time to test its effects. The results indicated all volunteers\' ability to complete the simplest tasks had deteriorated. One subject\'s memory capacity fell 36% and all the subjects had trouble thinking of words beginning with a nominated letter; in this case, the letter \"F\". All four of the men had markedly increased suggestibility, although this was not the case with the women.[18]','2017-03-25 03:51:14'),(503,66,'794fe8f77cedefd2077d3d8c7bf8a94ef290b24622411171214d09cb0792538a','47c877fce0834288a3a2f0b09c435f8d','','','In 1983, a team of deeply pious scientists conducted a radical experiment in an undisclosed facility.

Meanwhile, the Indonesian Ulema Council (MUI) had planned to issue guidelines for ethical behavior on social media.\n\nThe following are high-profile hoaxes that tricked Indonesian presidents, as quoted by Koran Tempo\'s January 23rd edition.\n\nMarried couple Idrus and Markonah claimed to be the King and Queen of Suku Anak Dalam indigenous people in Sumatra in the 1950s. They embarked tours to regions across Indonesia in support of West Irian liberation from Dutch imperialism.\n\nThe Palace heard the news. They were invited by a state official to meet with President Soekarno who needed support to liberate West Irian. Idrus and Markonah met with President Soekarno and were treated like honorable guests.\n\nTheir identity was revealed when they had a walk in a market in Jakarta. A pedicab driver identified the two since Idrus was his fellow pedicab driver. Markonah was a sex worker. It was the first high-profile hoax that duped Indonesian president.\n\nIn the 1970s, an unborn child of Acehnese women Cut Zahara Fona was said to be capable of talking and reciting the Quran. The info shook Indonesia and made it to the newspapers. State official Adam Malik and the first lady Tien Soeharto were also aware of the news. Both summoned Cut Zahara to the Presidential Palace.\n\nAdam and Tien personally heard Cut Zahara\'s unborn child recite the Quran. The news got even bigger. But a physician named Herman did not believe it, noting that a fetus could not breathe nor make a sound. Consequently, Herman was threatened to be killed by Cut Zaharas sympathizers. Her lies were finally revealed: she put a tape recorder on her belly.\n\nIn 2002, the Religious Affairs Minister Said Agil Al Munawar claimed that he was told about treasures belonging to Prabu Siliwangi, the King of Padjadjaran, in Batu Tulis, Bogor. He forwarded the info to Megawati. Megawati appointed Said Agil as the leader to dig out the treasures that were said to be enough to pay off the national debts. Said Agil later stopped the excavation. No treasure was found.\n\nThe news about water to fuel conversion (blue energy) in 2008 broke out. The inventor Joko Suprapto presented his innovation before President SBY, securing Rp10 billion to build theblue energy plant in Cikeas, Bogor. The invention was slammed by many, including the Gadjah Mada University, who said that it was all lies. Joko later apologized for being unable to turn water into fuel. He was later named a suspect by Yogyakarta Police.\n\nNews reporting about 10 million Chinese migrant workers entering Indonesia surfaced in both social media and online media at the end of 2016. The government dismissed the rumor, citing that Indonesia only houses 21,000 Chinese migrant workers of a total 74,000 foreign workers. The fake news story prompted President Joko Widodo to revive the plan to establish the National Cyber Agency.

But thousands of Indonesians still think it did, thanks to an enormously popular fake news story that circulated ahead of a mass protest in Jakarta December 2.\n\nSeveral websites alleged that FPI leader Habib Rizieq, who helped organize the protest against Jakartas ethnic Chinese governor, was abused by the state  a provocative, albeit false, claim that roused public sentiment.\n\nFake news is not new in Indonesian politics, despite its ascent as a buzzword after this years U.S. presidential election. Blatantly false stories have circulated within the social-media-loving populace since at least 2014, when they threatened to derail the campaign of current president Joko Jokowi Widodo. But they have taken on a particularly inflammatory zeal in recent months, when sectarian tensions have been high because of the blasphemy trial of Jakarta governor Basuki Ahok Tjahaja Purnama.\n\nThis week, military General Gatot Nurmantyo stated that the fake news revealed foreign interference in Indonesian politics. Its not clear this is the case, but its still striking that Indonesias government, which is notorious for censorship, hasnt been able to stop the problem by just blocking problematic sites.\n\nNew Jersey, Australia, or neither?\n\nThe fake news about Habib Rizieq was traced to servers in New Jersey and Australia, Gatot told the press this week. But this isnt necessarily evidence of meddling foreign interests.\n\nThe Habib Rizieq story was actually a convoluted clickbait ad for an online gambling website, jitupoker.biz, said Damar Juniarto, founder of the Digital Democracy Forum. That site was already shut down by the Ministry of Communications, by the way. Its a common practice of online gambling sites to use masking IP addresses from foreign countries to dodge Indonesian laws that prohibit online gambling.\n\nStill, said Juniarto, the storys timing was perfect for maximum outrage: it circulated November 20, right between the two hard-line rallies in Jakarta on November 4 and December 2.\n\nFake news spreads particularly fast in Indonesia because its citizens are such heavy users of social media and mobile phones, said Juniarto. It proliferates not just on Facebook and Twitter, but also messaging platforms like WhatsApp.\n\nWe can trace the explosion of fake news to the rise of social networking, he said. It started as a \'joke,\' then it became a business, and now its being used as a \'political strategy.\'\n\nEvery day on social media we find stories or memes that are proven untrue. It is really worrying, to be honest, said Raja Juli Anthoni, a spokesperson for Ahoks campaign.\n\nEven the blasphemy accusation against Ahok arose, in part, from a piece of doctored media.\n\nThis blasphemy case started when Buni Yani, a lecturer at Paramidan University, posted an edited version of Ahoks speech quoting the Quran on Facebook, said Tubaghus Ramadhan, a social media consultant who has worked on both the Jokowi 2014 and Ahok 2017 campaigns. He included an edited transcript of his speech that made it seem like he was directly insulting the Quran.\n\nIn an ironic twist, Buni Yanis trial for circulating misinformation started the very same day as Ahoks blasphemy trial.\n\nIn a precursor to the racially charged debate around Ahoks candidacy, current president Jokowi also faced fearmongering about his background when he ran for president in 2014. He was accused of being ethnically Chinese, a secret Christian, and a communist.\n\nFake news about Jokowis racial, ethnic and religious background was one of the most troublesome issues we faced in the 2014 general election, Ramadhan said.\n\nJokowi eventually took a highly publicized pilgrimage to Mecca to prove his Muslim credentials.\n\nOther recent instances of fake news include allegations that a mosque was deliberately burned down by intelligence agents in the Christian province of Papua, and that Ahok drank beer at an official meeting. It was bottled mineral water.\n\nFollowing claims that fake news influenced American voters in the recent presidential election, Facebook this week announced an initiative to curb bogus content by making it easier to report and disrupting financial incentives for spammers.\n\nTwitter and WhatsApp have yet to announce anti-fake-news measures of similar scale. Although these platforms should take the lead on making false stories harder to circulate, they cant eliminate them, especially because much of the damage occurs within days or hours of their dissemination.\n\nFor its part, Indonesias communications ministry has blocked several fake news sites, although new ones are cheap and easy to make. The country also walks a fine line on free speech because of its record of heavy-handed censorship.\n\nI think we must see the fake news as a social problem, not just as a technological problem, Juniarto said. We must try to understand why people believe in fake news, rather than news from reputable media.\n\nAhoks campaign spokesperson, Anthoni, said their best strategy until the February election is to put out factual and positive information so voters can decide for themselves.\n\nWe believe the only way to clarify this kind of stupidity is to give people more valid information, he said.','2017-03-25 03:51:14'),(508,67,'799a9082392ec0bde6ffb1ff8e6e756fdd9fbfbee2d54c5b73629318e5894b47','2f39e01dd9324b6aa72693fc65edbab4','','','Heads up!

Beijing\'s ambassador denounced the campaign, which attempted to link Chinese individual behaviour with the Beijing government.\n\nThe rumour-mongering emerged during a sensitive time - just days later, on Dec 27, an Indonesian court gave the go-ahead for a blasphemy trial involving incumbent Jakarta Governor Basuki Tjahaja Purnama, better known by his nickname Ahok, an ethnic Chinese Christian. President Joko is seen as his ally.\n\nAhok, who is seeking a second term, is accused of insulting Muslims by claiming during a rally ahead of the governorship elections next month that his political opponents were using the Quran to sway voters against him. He has denied the charge.\n\nIt is interesting to look at the spread of anti-Chinese sentiment, given that, apparently, opponents of Mr Joko are using social media to stage campaigns to discredit his government - and in particular, to circulate the fake news about the 10 million Chinese workers.\n\nThe anti-China and anti-Chinese campaign started even before Mr Joko became president, but became more intensive after he was elected.\n\nMr Joko, who saw China as a major source of Indonesian infrastructure projects and the tourist industry, went to Beijing in 2014 soon after the formation of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, inviting China to invest in Indonesia.\n\nHe asked President Xi Jinping to encourage Chinese tourists to visit Indonesia. A memorandum of understanding (MOU) was signed between Jakarta and Beijing, which stated that Indonesia would like to have 10 million Chinese tourists by 2019.\n\nThose in the anti-Joko group considered Jakarta too close to Beijing and were worried about China\'s domination. Many began campaigns against the Joko administration and China.\n\nIn May 2015, Chinese Vice-Premier Liu Yandong was invited to Indonesia. She made a speech at the University of Indonesia about deepening Beijing-Jakarta relations by intensifying interaction between the people of the two countries.\n\nShe noted that Indonesia and China formed 1.6 billion people, one-fourth of the world\'s population, and that this would be a force to be reckoned with.\n\nThe anti-Joko group began to spread rumours on social media, saying Madam Liu\'s speech mentioned 10 million new migrants coming to Indonesia over an unspecified period, and Indonesia would be \"ruled by the Chinese\". The 10 million figure for tourists became wrongly associated with the number of \"Chinese migrants\".\n\nThis provocative statement, which was not in her speech, continued to circulate on Indonesian social media and in small newspapers. There was a denial, but this failed to stop the rumour.\n\nThen, in June 2015, social media belonging to anti-Chinese and anti-China groups and small newspapers such as Pos Kota made an issue aboutChinese labourers in Sino-Indonesian projects.\n\nFor example, a cement factory in Lebak in Banten province was said to have hired 799 Chinese migrant workers, mainly doing non-skilled work. The company responded that it had hired only 400 Chinese workers with special skills.\n\nJoint project companies in Bali and Kalimantan were said to have hired many more Chinese \"migrant labourers\". The issue lasted for several months and was eventually debated in Parliament. Manpower Minister Hanif Dhakiri investigated and stated that the Chinese labourers had legal permits and would return to China once the projects were completed.\n\nHowever, Tempo, an influential news weekly in Jakarta, published a special issue on Sept 6, 2015 about Chinese workers in Indonesia. The cover had the headline, \"Welcome, workers from \'Cina\' \", alongside a caricature of President Joko wearing overalls like a Chinese worker and wielding a hammer.\n\nTempo noted that many workers in the projects were blue-collar workers who could be replaced by Indonesian workers. China-Indonesia joint projects were supposed to hire one Chinese migrant worker to 10 Indonesian workers, but project managers reportedly employed mostly Chinese workers. This was despite seven million Indonesian workers being jobless.\n\nIndonesian Vice-President Jusuf Kalla in September 2015 clarified that the Chinese labourers worked for special projects and did not take away Indonesian jobs; on the contrary, the projects created more employment opportunities for Indonesians..\n\nThe resurgence of these anti-Chinese rumours coincided with Ahok\'s court case and a statement by Mr Joko during a Dec 5 visit to Balikpapan in which he noted that he had signed an MOU with Beijing on Indonesia\'s target for 10 million Chinese tourists by 2019. He stressed that these people were not workers, saying there were only 14,000 Chinese workers in Indonesia (he later corrected the figure to 21,000).\n\nMr Joko further explained that Indonesia needed the income from tourism to pay for the country\'s infrastructure development, as the revenue from taxes was insufficient.\n\nDespite his comments, the heated reactions and prevalence of rumours suggest that rumour-mongers and those out to destabilise his administration - and clobber his ally Ahok - are gaining some traction. The worry is that partisan games to win elections may further stoke racial tensions.\n\n The writer is a visiting senior fellow at ISEAS - Yusof Ishak Institute.','2017-03-25 03:51:14'),(510,67,'799a9082392ec0bde6ffb1ff8e6e756fdd9fbfbee2d54c5b73629318e5894b47','3d16cfe9ac5c45f2b53c5ddc4b6dfd9f','','','President Joko Jokowi Widodo knows very well the power of social media. In fact, many have credited his success in the 2014 presidential election to his ability to use multiple social media platforms to mobilize his supporters.\n\nBut the 2014 presidential election also taught Jokowi about the new menace to society, fake news. As voting day neared in early 2014, fake news began to circulate to hurt his credibility, including articles accusing him of having ties to the now-defunct Indonesian Communist Party (PKI) or another piece that alleged he was of Chinese descent.\n\nThings went downhill after the election, with the massive proliferation of fake news and hoaxes through many social media platforms and a number of messaging services such as WhatsApp.\n\nAfter huffing and puffing over the past few months, Jokowi finally declared war on fake news and hoaxes on Thursday.\n\nHe convened a Cabinet meeting with relevant ministers to discuss measures that could be taken to combat fake news and disinformation.\n\nCiting data that said there were 132 million internet users in the country, about 52 percent of the total population, Jokowi urged that people should be aware that information technology can also make negative impacts on society.\n\nJokowi said of the total number, 129 million were active social media users and each person spent threeand-a-half hours a day on the internet through their mobile phones, which helped the proliferation of fake news.\n\nThe President has repeatedly expressed in recent months his concerns over the growing intensity of disinformation on social media, including the latest fake news item on the influx of millions of Chinese workers into Indonesia.\n\nJokowi has ordered an investigation into the fake news and ordered the prosecution of individuals responsible for spreading the rumor, which he said was fanned to fuel anti-China sentiment.\n\nThe President has also expressed concern over the use of social media for people to exchanging memes or provocative remarks to mock and attack embattled Jakarta gubernatorial candidate Basuki Ahok Tjahaja Purnama, who stands accused of blasphemy.\n\nIn the Thursday meeting, Jokowi called for strict law enforcement and what he called an evaluation of online media outlets responsible for producing provocative fake news.\n\nJokowi has also ordered relevant government agencies to launch a massive campaign on social media and internet literacy, saying that it is essential to see netizens get involved in the campaign to bring about positive and productive communication on social media consistent with our cultural values.\n\nResponding to Jokowis order, Communications and Information Minister Rudiantara said he planned to launch what he called an anti-hoax society in January.\n\nThe Cabinet meeting also ordered government agencies such as the National Encryption Agency (Lemsaneg) and the State Intelligence Agency (BIN), as well as the Culture and Education Ministry to improve coordination in handling issues related to the internet and social media.\n\nRudiantara said better coordination and fast response from relevant ministries and institutions was crucial in dealing with fake news.\n\nHe also maintained that the government would continue to protect freedom of speech in the fight against fake news.','2017-03-25 03:51:14'),(511,67,'799a9082392ec0bde6ffb1ff8e6e756fdd9fbfbee2d54c5b73629318e5894b47','b9867785d01741e0903438f1aa35b448','','','In late November, Indonesian social-media activist Ulin Yusron found himself depicted in a meme. The image, which went viral, falsely portrayed the long-haired male journalist as Amalia Ayuningtyas  a female election volunteer for the governor of Jakarta. The photo, the text claimed, was of Amalia immodestly casting off her usual hijab. It asked: Wheres the Veil??\n\nJakarta\'s Christian and ethnically Chinese governor  Basuki Tjahaja Purnama, popularly known as Ahok  is a target for hard-line Muslims, who have successfully pressured the authorities to put him on trial for blasphemy . It is not surprising that memes are being produced that seek to depict the Muslim volunteers in his camp as irreligious and profane.\n\nWhen I first saw it, I was able to laugh, Ulin tells TIME about the photo collage. But later on, it became so troublesome because there were people who believed it  [The meme] was around for quite a while, and I became tired of explaining it.\n\nHoaxes like this, and fake news items in general, have become a massive problem in Indonesia in recent months, coinciding with the hotly contested Jakarta gubernatorial election campaign. To be sure, the sharing of fake news on social media has contributed to political tension in many countries  by one estimate, it generated more social-media engagement than real news during the U.S. presidential election in November  but in Indonesia, with its recent incidences of domestic terrorism, and its long and bloody history of anticommunist, anti-Christian and anti-Chinese pogroms, inflaming ethnic and political tensions is potentially deadly.\n\nPresident Joko Jokowi Widodo, seen as a Muslim moderate, has vowed to crack down, telling a Cabinet meeting that fake news was nothing short of an attempt to destabilize his government. Slander, hatred and rude words on social media are increasingly troubling people, Jokowi tweeted on Dec. 29. We need determined and tough law enforcement.\n\nThe problem first drew significant attention during Indonesia\'s 2014 presidential election, in which Jokowi  Ahok\'s predecessor as Jakarta\'s top official  was a candidate. During electioneering, Jokowi was the constant target of a smear campaign that falsely claimed he was, among other things, the child of Indonesian Communist Party members, of Chinese descent, and a Christian. (He was forced to make his marriage certificate public to quell the rumors.)\n\nNow, the creators of fake news are targeting Ahok, who was deputy governor of Indonesia\'s sprawling capital under Jokowi. Ahok succeeded his boss in the governorship and, backed by Jokowis party, is now seeking his own mandate in the gubernatorial election next year, competing with two other rivals, including former President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono\'s son. Ahok\'s candidacy is opposed by hard-liners who, insisting that Indonesia\'s top jobs be filled Muslims only, want to quash any chances Ahok may have of following Jokowi into the national arena.\n\nAn edited video and transcript of a campaign speech Ahok made in September, uploaded onto Facebook, went viral and led to ultra-conservative Muslims accusing him of denigrating the Quran. (Ahok suggested in the speech that hard-liners who cited a Quranic verse to support their position that non-Muslims shouldn\'t hold high office were misleading voters. His exact words were: Ladies and gentlemen, you dont have to vote for me  because youve been lied to by those using [the Qurans] Surah al-Maidah verse 51.)\n\nThree massive demonstrations resulted, bringing tens of thousands of people to the streets of Jakarta, demanding that Ahok be jailed. He was subsequently put in the dock .\n\nAhok\'s Chinese ethnicity is the target of much of Indonesia\'s false news  highly disturbing in a country where tens of thousands of Chinese have lost their lives in pogroms dating back to Dutch colonial rule. There are false rumors of 10 million mainland Chinese workers swamping Indonesia (which Jokowi has rebuffed, saying that 10 million is the number of Chinese tourists we hope will come). Others claim that the design of Indonesias new monetary notes resembles Chinese currency  or that Ahoks free HPV vaccine program could make girls infertile, and is, therefore, part of a Chinese conspiracy to diminish the Indonesian population. Hoaxers also claimed that the commander of the armed forces, General Gatot Nurmantyo, has warned that communist China has started to meddle in this country. Both the Indonesian military and the general have denied he ever made such a statement.\n\nAt the same time, Anti-Chinese sentiment isnt independent of its own. It is part of a larger network, says the social-media activist Ulin, who is a supporter of Ahok. He says that fake news is also whipping up anticommunist and anti-Shiite feelings. All of this is to heighten anti-Ahok sentiment while at the same time de-legitimizing Jokowi.\n\nHoax news has been a daily phenomenon in Indonesia, says Titi Anggraini, executive director of the Association for Elections and Democracy, a Jakarta-based elections watchdog that is also known as Perludem in Indonesian. But, the spread of hoax news intensified during the 2014 presidential election and is intensifying in [the run-up to] the 2017 Jakarta gubernatorial election.\n\nThe government, watchdog groups and even religious organizations have taken steps to stem its spread. The Communications Ministry on Wednesday blocked 11 websites, mostly for spreading hatred and misinformation, following a similar step in November. Fact-check sites, apps and Facebook pages, run by activists and volunteers, have sprung up to set the record straight. Nahdlatul Ulama, the biggest Islamic mass organization in Indonesia, has kicked off an anti-fake-news campaign called #TurnBackHoax, while Muhammadiyah, the second biggest Islamic organization, has declared that spreading hoax news is tantamount to a sin. The Press Council has also said it will be verifying trusted media outlets.\n\nSuch actions are important to make things right and to teach a lesson to offenders, Titi tells TIME. But, she adds, The legal process, especially criminal punishment, is really ultimum remidium [the last resort]  and calls for digital literacy education. She also wants guarantees that law enforcement will respect freedom of expression. But that is no easy balance to strike in Indonesia\'s tense political atmosphere.','2017-03-25 03:51:14'),(512,68,'7bace9490ce9923ccd476e829541bcf0f66d19676fca0c3554b02973ff0183da','adb8f0db7a5e40e68a603dfdb305ca8a','','','President Obama has signed an executive order that lowers the age of consent for legal sex to 13.\n\nA fake news website is behind this legal consent myth.\n\nNow8News, a fake news website that is designed to look like a local news channel, falsely reported that President Obama had signed an executive order lowering the age of consent to 13 effective on March 1, 2016.

Jerry Brown has signed and vetoed numerous bills over the past week. Here is some of the key legislation that he has chosen to either sign or reject.\n\nCalifornia is moving to crack down on bad actors in the workers\' compensation system following a report that an estimated $1 billion has been embezzled from the state program.\n\nA new law requires the workers\' compensation director to suspend hospitals, doctors and other medical providers from the system if they have been convicted of any wrongdoing related to health care fraud.\n\nBrown announced Friday he signed AB1244. It will take effect on Jan. 1.\n\nIt follows an April report by The Center for Investigative Reporting that some doctors and administrators scam the system by performing unnecessary procedures or routinely falsify bills.\n\nState and federal prosecutors say in the report that gaps in state oversight compromise the system and state agencies can\'t adequately pressure care providers.\n\nMayors, city council members and other local elected officials in California will be required to take two hours of sexual harassment training following scandals involving politicians in San Diego and Sacramento.\n\nGov. Jerry Brown signed AB1661 on Thursday to require that elected city and county officials take the same online training required for supervisors at California employers with 50 or more workers. It must be completed within six months of their election and repeated every two years.\n\nBob Filner resigned in 2013 as mayor of San Diego after some 20 women alleged that he groped them or engaged in other inappropriate behavior.\n\nIn Sacramento, a law firm investigating an allegation against Mayor Kevin Johnson suggested he be counseled against hugging or touching people at work.\n\nGov. Jerry Brown on Thursday signed a bill to promote the development of an early warning system for earthquakes.\n\nSB438 establishes the California Earthquake Early Warning Program and Advisory Board within the state Office of Emergency Services to further spur investment.\n\n\"We\'ve seen the devastation earthquakes have caused in California,\" Brown said in a written statement. \"This keeps us on track to build a statewide warning system that can potentially save lives.\"\n\nThe state first rolled out a prototype early warning system known as ShakeAlert to beta testers in 2012. Brown earlier this year directed $10 million of the 2016-17 budget to go toward further expanding the system, according to the governor\'s office.\n\nMexico, China and Japan are among several other nations that currently use earthquake early warning systems, the governor\'s office said.\n\nCalifornia will require Uber and Lyft to conduct background checks on all drivers and lay off certain criminals beginning in 2017.\n\nBrown announced Wednesday that he signed legislation aiming to protect people who use ride-hailing services.\n\nBeginning Jan. 1, transportation networks cannot employ drivers who are registered sex offenders, violent felons or terrorists. AB1289 will also ban people convicted in the last seven years of assault, domestic violence or driving under the influence.\n\nCompanies could be fined up to $5,000 per banned driver.\n\nUber and Lyft terms and conditions require riders to agree that the companies aren\'t liable for their safety.\n\nProsecutors have identified drivers in Los Angeles and San Francisco convicted of murder, sexual assault and other offenses that will make them ineligible under the new law.\n\nBrown approved legislation to let voters take and share photographs of their ballots on social media starting next year. Until now, the practice has been illegal  and even with this law passing, it will continue to be illegal until next year. Sorry, social media mavens.\n\nA new California law allows self-driving vehicles to be tested on public roads with no human backup.\n\nUnder the bill signed into law Thursday by Brown, vehicles without steering wheels, brake pedals or accelerators can be tested at two Bay Area sites. The vehicles will be limited to speeds of less than 35 mph.\n\nThe trials will take place at Contra Costa Transportation Authority\'s autonomous-vehicle testing site on a former naval facility and at a business park that contains public roads.\n\nOfficials say Google and Apple have expressed interest in using the former naval site. The business park project will involve 12-person worker-transport shuttles.\n\nGov. Brown on Tuesday signed into law \"right-to-try\" legislation that will give certain terminally-ill Californians access to experimental drugs not yet approved by the U.S. Food & Drug Administration.\n\nThe new law, authored by Assembly Majority Leader Ian Calderon (D-Whittier), allows drug makers to give terminally-ill patients access to investigational treatments that have passed basic safety testing.\n\nPatients must meet a number of requirements to qualify for the program, including that they have only a matter of months to live and that two doctors recommend they try the experimental drug.\n\nCalifornia is making it illegal to disclose secretly recorded conversations with medical professionals under a new law backed by Planned Parenthood.\n\nThe new law responds to surreptitious videos released last year of Planned Parenthood officials allegedly discussing the illegal sale of fetal tissue. The organization said the videos were deceptively edited.\n\nSharing secretly recorded private conversations involving a health care provider could land Californians in prison for up to a year under the bill Gov. Jerry Brown announced signing Friday.\n\nDomestic violence victims and certain law enforcement officials are exempt from the law.\n\nSome liberal lawmakers were torn over AB1671 between defending Planned Parenthood and protecting free speech rights.\n\nIt will still be legal to secretly record evidence of extortion, kidnapping, bribery, human trafficking or other violent felonies.\n\nBrown waded further into the national debate over transgender rights Thursday as he signed a bill requiring that all single-stall toilets in California be designated as gender neutral.\n\nThe measure requires that businesses and governments post non-gender-specific signs on single-occupant restrooms by March 1, 2017. Democratic Assemblyman Phil Ting of San Francisco said his legislation would establish the nation\'s most inclusive restroom-access law and \"chart a new course of equality for the nation.\"\n\n\"This simple concept is oddly cutting-edge when compared with the discrimination being enacted in other states,\" Ting said earlier, while urging the Democratic governor to sign the bill, AB1732.\n\nLawmakers sent the legislation to Brown in August, a day after a federal judge temporarily blocked an order by President Barack Obama requiring that public schools let students use bathrooms that correlate with their gender identity.\n\nCalifornia students can already do so under a law Brown signed in 2013. He also approved adding gender identity to the state\'s antidiscrimination laws in 2011.\n\nSupporters of the new legislation said 19 states considered restricting access to restrooms, locker rooms and other facilities based on the user\'s biological sex, including North Carolina, which passed a law requiring people to use restrooms based on their gender at birth.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court will consider reviewing whether a transgender Virginia high school senior should be permitted to use the boys restroom.\n\nSupporters say gender-neutral restrooms also would help parents with children of a different gender and adults caring for aging parents. It would not affect restrooms that have multiple stalls.\n\nRandy Thomasson, president of SaveCalifornia.com, a nonprofit conservative organization, pointed to potential conflicts arising from gender-neutral facilities.\n\n\"What woman wants a man poking his head in the restroom door that somehow didn\'t shut or lock? How many women want to use a urine-stained toilet seat?\" he wrote in urging Brown to veto the bill.\n\nHe fears that what he called a \"radical state takeover of the private sector\'s restroom policies\" could affect religious schools and home businesses.\n\nOpponents said in December that they had failed to collect enough signatures to advance a proposed ballot measure that would have asked voters to require transgender people to use the public restrooms that correspond with their biological sex.\n\nCalifornia will limit publicly funded travel to states that have laws restricting the rights of gay and transgender people under legislation signed by Gov. Brown. The governor said Tuesday he\'s approving AB1887.\n\nThe bill by Democratic Assemblyman Evan Low of Campbell bars non-essential travel to states with laws that sanction or require discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, gender identity or gender expression.\n\nIt also blocks California state agencies from requiring their employees to travel to those states. The bill applies to state agencies and the University of California and California State University systems.\n\nThe attorney general will come up with a list of states to which travel is restricted.\n\nBrown announced that he signed legislation allowing state inspectors to seize and destroy used cigarette stamps, which are affixed to cigarette packaging to show tobacco has been legally purchased. It comes in response to inspectors recently finding large collections intended for reuseAP\n\nBrown approved legislation to let voters designate anyone to turn in their ballots.\n\nBrown signed five bills Thursday and says he\'s asking the commission to move forward with other changes that died on the last day of the legislative session.\n\nSome lawmakers accuse the CPUC of being too cozy with the companies it regulates.\n\nThe bills Brown signed will require commissioners to disclose private communications with utility officials and hold meetings away from the CPUC\'s San Francisco headquarters.\n\nBrown challenged the CPUC to implement some of the changes called for in stalled legislation, such as appointing an ethics ombudsman.\n\nHe also says his administration will work on a plan to transfer regulatory authority for transportation companies to other state agencies.\n\nBrown has agreed to restore the voting rights of convicted felons serving time in county jails.\n\nThe bill that Brown announced signing Wednesday also reinstates the voting eligibility of felons on probation or under community supervision beginning next year. It does not affect those in state or federal prisons.\n\nAB2466 stems from California\'s criminal justice realignment, which led to some people convicted of low-level felonies serving time in county jails.\n\nRepublican lawmakers say felons should not be allowed to cast ballots while serving a sentence, with Sen. Patricia Bates of Laguna Niguel saying it compromises the integrity of elections.\n\nDemocratic Assemblywoman Shirley Weber of San Diego says opponents don\'t want to allow certain people to vote. She says civic participation can be a critical part of reducing recidivism.\n\nBrown said Friday that he signed two bills that emerged amid national outrage over the six-month jail sentence given to a former Stanford University swimmer who sexually assaulted a woman passed out near a trash bin.\n\nBrown approved requiring sentences to be served in state prison for defendants convicted of assaulting unconscious victims instead of the jail sentence like the one Brock Turner received in June and served in a county jail before obtaining early release.\n\nTurner\'s case burst into the spotlight after a poignant statement from the victim swept through social media.\n\nPoliticians and law enforcement officials have lined up alongside sexual assault survivors to criticize Turner\'s sentence, back a recall effort against the judge and urge Brown to sign the tougher sentencing legislation.\n\nThe 21-year-old one-time Olympic hopeful was released from the Santa Clara County jail in September after serving three months for good behavior. He will be on probation for three years in his native Ohio for crimes that carried a maximum penalty of 14 years in prison.\n\nBrown said in a signing message that he usually opposes adding more mandatory minimum sentences. But he said he signed the sentencing bill \"because I believe it brings a measure of parity to sentencing for criminal acts that are substantially similar.\"\n\nOutside jail after Turner\'s release, county Sheriff Laurie Smith said she believed his sentence was too light and urged Brown to sign the bill.\n\n\"Letting felons convicted of such crimes get off with probation discourages other survivors from coming forward and sends the message that raping incapacitated victims is no big deal,\" Democratic Assemblyman Bill Dodd of Napa said in a statement after lawmakers approved his bill in August.\n\nBut more than two dozen groups dedicated to ending campus sexual assaults urged Brown to veto it, fearing that the punishment would more likely be applied to minority and lower-income defendants than white offenders like Turner.\n\nMahroh Jahangiri, executive director of Know Your IX, a national organization representing survivors, said mandatory minimum sentences also could deter victims from pressing charges against their attackers, who are often people they know.\n\nBrown also signed another bill permitting sexual assault victims to say in court that they were raped, even if the attack doesn\'t meet the technical definition under California law.\n\nState law defines rape as nonconsensual intercourse between a man and a woman, leaving out other forms of sexual assault, including Turner\'s 2015 attack on the woman he met at a fraternity party. He was convicted of three sexual assault felonies, including digital penetration of an unconscious woman.\n\nThe rape definition that came under fire in the Turner case leaves Brown in an awkward position as he promotes a November ballot initiative that would allow earlier release of prisoners as a way to control overcrowding.\n\nProposition 57 would allow earlier parole consideration for nonviolent inmates, but the legal definition of a violent felony includes just 23 crimes, such as murder, kidnapping and forcible rapes and sexual assaults.\n\nTurner\'s crimes were considered nonviolent under California law because he assaulted an intoxicated or unconscious person who could not resist, so he didn\'t have to use force.\n\n\"All sexual assaults are a violent offense. There is no such thing as a nonviolent sexual assault,\" Stanford law professor Michele Dauber said.\n\nDauber is a friend of the woman Turner assaulted and is leading a campaign to recall Santa Clara County Superior Court Judge Aaron Persky for departing from the usual minimum sentence in the case.\n\nThe bill passed without a dissenting vote, though Democratic Assemblywoman Cristina Garcia of Bell Gardens scaled back her initial proposal to expand the definition of rape. Prosecutors were concerned the original version would prevent them from filing multiple charges against perpetrators.\n\n\"Sexual penetration without consent is rape. It is never invited, wanted or warranted. Rape is rape, period,\" Garcia said in statement. \"When we fail to call rape \'rape, we rob survivors and their families of the justice they deserve.\"\n\nBrown is approving stricter safety standards for charter and school buses following high-profile incidents. Heannounced Tuesday that he signed three bus-safety bills.\n\nOne enacts National Transportation Safety Board charter bus safety recommendations that Congress has not adopted. Democratic Sen. Ricardo Lara of Bell Gardens introduced the change after a bus carrying high school students to Humboldt State University collided with a tractor-trailer, killing eight bus passengers and both drivers.\n\nBrown also signed a bill by Democratic Sen. Tony Mendoza of Artesia requiring new safety equipment on school buses to prevent children from being left unattended.\n\nA third bill gives the California Highway Patrol stronger authority to inspect charter-bus terminals and order potentially dangerous buses out of service.\n\nCalifornia law already requires that a person be convicted before police can seize cash or property valued under $25,000 that\'s believed to have been attained illegally.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Holly Mitchell of Los Angeles says police work around that law by partnering with federal agencies to seize assets before convictions, reaping millions of dollars.\n\nBrown said Thursday that he signed SB443, Mitchell\'s bill to prohibit law enforcement agencies from profiting off of those partnerships in cases of suspected drug activity.\n\nIt also increases the ceiling for other crimes to $40,000.\n\nCalifornia is fixing a voter-approved initiative that required registered sex offenders to disclose certain personal information.\n\nVoters in 2012 mandated that convicted sex offenders reveal their email addresses, screen names and other electronic identifiers to law enforcement.\n\nThe 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals put that requirement on hold immediately after the initiative passed. The court decided in 2014 that it would violate the free-speech rights of about 73,000 offenders who have completed their sentences.\n\nBrown announced Wednesday that he signed SB448 in response to that ruling.\n\nThe law will limit the reporting requirements to sex offenders convicted of a felony after Jan. 1, 2017. It will apply only to those who used the internet to track victims, traffic them or collect or distribute obscene material.\n\nBrown took action on several voting-related bills, including legislation that lays the groundwork for more California counties to conduct elections entirely through mail-in ballots.\n\nBrown announced Thursday that he signed SB450, which allows 18 counties to set up vote centers where people could drop off mail-in ballots in the 10 days before the 2018 election. The rest could move to the system in 2020.\n\nLawmakers say the current voting system is outdated.\n\nThe emotional stories of women who say they were sexually assaulted more than a decade ago by comedian Bill Cosby prompted California state lawmakers to approve a bill to eliminate the state\'s 10-year limit on filing rape and related charges.\n\nOn Wednesday, Brown announced that he has approved the legislation to revoke that limitation.\n\nBeginning next year, the bill will end the statute of limitations in certain rape and child molestation cases. It will also end the time limit on older cases in which the statute of limitations has not yet expired.\n\nThe new law, SB813, will not, however, help women who made allegations against Cosby dating back more than 10 years, including some from the 1960s.\n\nCosby has repeatedly denied the sex abuse allegations made by dozens of women nationwide. He is facing just one criminal case stemming from sex abuse. A trial is set to begin in June in Pennsylvania.\n\nDefense lawyer Angela Agrusa has said Cosby\'s accusers have stirred passions even though their stories of abuse have not been investigated by police.\n\nCalifornia lawmakers sent the statute of limitations bill to Brown without a single dissenting vote.\n\nState Sen. Connie Leyva, D-Chino, credited intense lobbying of lawmakers and the governor by advocates who \"kept the fight alive for the countless rape victims that have already spoken up and also those that have yet to come forward.\"\n\nThe bill\'s signing \"tells every rape and sexual assault victim in California that they matter and that, regardless of when they are ready to come forward, they will always have an opportunity to seek justice in a court of law,\" she said in a statement. \"Rapists should never be able to evade legal consequences simply because an arbitrary time limit has expired. There must never be an expiration date on justice!\"\n\nSeventeen other states already have no statute of limitations on rape, according to the California Women\'s Law Center.\n\nIn June, Colorado doubled the amount of time sexual assault victims have to seek charges from 10 to 20 years, a decision also prompted by the Cosby allegations. Nevada extended its time limit from four to 20 years last year after testimony by one of Cosby\'s accusers.\n\nAdvocates say victims may need years before they can bring themselves to make an allegation to law enforcement. Several women said during a spring legislative hearing on the California bill that they did not come forward sooner because they were traumatized or afraid no one would believe them.\n\nHowever, if they wait 10 years, victims find \"the door to the courthouse is slammed in her face,\" said high-profile Los Angeles attorney Gloria Allred, who represents 30 women who say they were sexually assaulted more than a decade ago by Bill Cosby. None can bring criminal charges because the time limit has expired.\n\nCivil rights groups and public defenders countered that extending the time limit could lead to false convictions as evidence disappears and memories fade among victims and witnesses. They say it\'s not fair to expect a suspect to recall an alibi decades later.\n\nIt could even be counterproductive, California Public Defenders Association representative Carolyn George argued, because the time limit encourages victims to come forward and investigators to move quickly.\n\nCalifornia is joining dozens of other states in outlawing powdered alcohol before it hits the market amid concerns the inconspicuous drug would too easily become a safety hazard.\n\nBrown announced Wednesday that he signed SB819 to ban any \"alcohol prepared or sold in a powder or crystalline form.\"\n\nRepublican Sen. Bob Huff of San Dimas says concerns arise from the ease with which it could be transferred to minors, slipped to someone unknowingly, snorted or added to already-alcoholic drinks.\n\nLegislative analysts say at least 27 other states have banned the substance.\n\nA company that\'s moving toward manufacturing powdered alcohol disputes that the product is likely to be abused. Palcohol says it is a safe and convenient way for adults to drink.\n\nGun owners and law enforcement officers will be required to lock up their firearms if they leave them in an unattended vehicle under legislation Gov. Jerry Brown signed Monday in response to high-profile thefts from police vehicles in the San Francisco Bay Area.\n\nThe measure was among four gun bills the Democratic governor signed, and it joins more than a half-dozen gun-control measures approved this year. Brown also vetoed two gun bills.\n\nBeginning Jan. 1, SB869 will require that anyone  including police and people with concealed weapon permits  leaving a handgun in a vehicle lock it in the trunk or a container out of plain sight, or face a $1,000 fine. Police won\'t face sanctions during urgent situations.\n\nHandguns stolen from law enforcement officers\' cars last year were used in the San Francisco killing of 32-year-old Kate Steinle in July and 27-year-old Oakland muralist Antonio Ramos in September.\n\nSteinle was shot in the back as she walked with her father and a family friend along a popular San Francisco pier. Oakland police said Ramos was among artists working on a community mural when he was fatally shot after an apparent argument.\n\nHis family filed a claim in June against the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, saying it was partly responsible for the shooting because it was committed with an agent\'s stolen gun.\n\nIn January, three handguns and an FBI agent\'s badge were stolen from a locked vehicle equipped with an alarm in Benicia, about 30 miles northeast of San Francisco.\n\nBrown is approving a series of new safety requirements for natural gas storage wells following a leak that drove thousands of families from their homes in the Porter Ranch area of Los Angeles.\n\nThe Democratic governor said Monday he\'s signed SB887, which requires continuous monitoring for leaks and regular inspections at natural gas storage facilities.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Fran Pavley of Agoura Hills, who wrote the legislation, says California needs to be more proactive about monitoring energy infrastructure for potential problems.\n\nEarlier this month, Southern California Gas Co. pleaded no contest to a misdemeanor charge of failing to promptly report the gas leak as part of a $4 million settlement with prosecutors. The company waited three days before notifying the state of the problem at the Aliso Canyon facility. AP\n\nBrown has approved two bills targeting wage discrimination against women and minorities in California.\n\nBrown said Friday he\'s signed SB1063, which expands requirements for fair pay beyond gender to also protect against racial discrimination. The bill by Compton Democratic Sen. Isadore Hall builds on a 2015 equal-pay law that\'s already considered the nation\'s toughest.\n\nBrown also signed SB1676, which prohibits employers from basing compensation solely on a worker\'s prior wage. Democratic Assemblywoman Nora Campos of San Jose says women should not be penalized for prior salaries that may have been unequal to men\'s.\n\nBrown signed the bill a year after he vetoed a measure that would have kept employers from even asking about prior pay.AP\n\nNearly 7 million California workers will be automatically enrolled in a retirement savings account under legislation Brown signed Thursday in an attempt to address growing fears that many workers will be financially unprepared to retire.\n\nThe legislation creates a state-run retirement program for workers who don\'t have an employer-sponsored plan, many of them working in lower-wage positions. It requires employers to automatically enroll their workers and deduct money from each paycheck, though workers can opt out or set their own savings rate. The account could also be carried from job to job.\n\nSupporters of the concept hope that requiring workers to affirmatively opt out will make them less likely to do so, allowing them to set aside a retirement nest egg over time so they don\'t have to rely solely on Social Security in their post-work years. A third of all American workers  and two-thirds of part-time workers  don\'t have access to a retirement plan through their employer, the Pew Charitable Trusts reported in September, relying on U.S. Census Bureau data.\n\n\"It\'s something very important now in today\'s age of spend now, worry about it later,\" said Brown, a Democrat who often warns about the long-term consequences of spending decisions. \"This is save now, prepare for later.\"\n\nThe financial services industry aggressively lobbied Brown for a veto, warning that the proposal is built on shaky financial assumptions and may create overwhelming political pressure for taxpayers to bail it out if it hits hard times.\n\nCalifornia lawmakers voted in 2012 to study the idea of creating a publicly run retirement plan for private-sector workers. After lawyers and financial analysts said the program was likely viable, the Legislature this year decided to implement the plan.\n\nThe move has been closely watched due to the $1 million California spent researching and refining its proposal and the state\'s sheer size, with 12 percent of the U.S. population. Oregon and Illinois are working to implement similar programs, and studies have been ordered in several other states.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Labor gave the green light in August to retirement plans run by states and large cities or counties, putting to rest questions about their legality and removing a major hurdle.\n\nCalifornia\'s plan, SB1234 by Senate President Pro Tem Kevin de Leon, D-Los Angeles, requires employers that don\'t offer retirement accounts to automatically enroll their employees in the state-run plan. Unless workers opt out, a percentage of their earnings would be deducted from each paycheck and held in lower-risk investments. The plans would stick with workers as they move from job to job, allowing them to accumulate larger balances in a single account.\n\nLike a standard individual retirement account or 401(k), the investments would be subject to the ups and downs of financial markets, including the potential for losses.\n\nSecure Choice, as the program is known, would be overseen by a board with authority to make decisions about investment options, the default savings rate and benefit payouts in retirement. Financial consultants recommended a default savings rate of 5 percent, which would rise by 1 percent a year until it reaches 10 percent of pay.\n\nThe cost to the state is unclear, as it depends how many employees participate, but it could reach up to $134 million over the first several years, according to the legislative analysis. The program is expected to eventually fund itself with fees on workers\' deposits.\n\nBut Paul Schott Stevens, president and CEO of the Investment Company Institute, which represents mutual funds and other investment products that comprise a large share of traditional retirement savings accounts, said in a letter to Brown that the program underestimates the risks and is based on unrealistically rosy assumptions about the rate of savings.\n\nWith so many financial pressures facing lower-income workers, many are likely to opt out or withdraw their balances early, he wrote, and the cost to administer millions of small accounts would be higher than proponents assume. Moreover, he said, the state\'s obligations under securities law are uncertain, and the political pressure for taxpayers to backfill investment losses would be intense.\n\n\"It simply would be imprudent to move forward with the program without much further study and far greater assurance that its costs are fully understood and accounted for,\" Stevens wrote.\n\nBrown approved a variety of human trafficking legislation, including legislation decriminalizing prostitution for minors and taking other steps to make life after human trafficking easier for those forced into it.\n\nThe Democratic governor announced Monday he signed SB1322 to ban police from charging people under the age of 18 with prostitution.\n\nHe also signed bills allowing people to defend themselves against additional criminal charges or records if they were coerced to commit an offense as a human trafficking victim.\n\nOther legislation will raise the age from 13 to 15 that kids can testify outside a courtroom in human trafficking cases, protect victims\' names from disclosure and mandate they have access to county services. AP\n\nBrown approved legislation that puts California taxpayers on the hook for up to $250 million if Los Angeles is awarded the 2024 Olympics and the Games go over budget.\n\nBrown announced Thursday that he signed the bill, SB1465, by Democratic Senate President Pro Tem Kevin de Leon of Los Angeles.\n\nL.A. Olympics boosters say the guarantee is needed to bolster their case against rivals seeking the Games in Paris and Budapest, Hungary.\n\nThey insist L.A. has a sustainable budget and insurance protection. Backers say the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics were profitable.\n\nCritics say the guarantee is not a good use of tax dollars.\n\nThe state provided similar guarantees for Los Angeles\' bid for the 2016 Olympics.\n\nThe International Olympic Committee will name the host city in September 2017.\n\nBrown has signed legislation to get taxpayers\' donations into the hands of charities more quickly following a critical report by The Associated Press.\n\nBrown signed SB1476 over the weekend. The legislation was introduced after an AP investigation found at least one-tenth of all charitable donations made on tax returns went unspent.\n\nAP\'s review found nearly $10 million in 29 funds was awaiting delivery to or distribution by state agencies and another $278,000 had reverted to state coffers.\n\nTaxpayers have donated more than $100 million through the check-off system since 1982. They benefit social services, public health, environmental protection and other charitable causes.\n\nHis bill would continuously appropriate the aid and retire a fund if taxpayers provide less than $250,000 in one year. AP\n\nBrown rejected a bill that would have increased transparency at charter schools.\n\nBrown on Friday vetoed AB709, which would have required charter schools to comply with the same open meetings, public records and conflict-of-interest laws that apply to other public schools.\n\nBrown said his view hasn\'t changed since he vetoed a virtually identical bill in 2014. At the time, he said he supports transparency but the bill goes too far in prescribing how charter school boards must operate.\n\nSupporters say charter schools spend public funds and should be subject to the same conflict and transparency standards that apply to government agencies.\n\nThe bill was written by Democratic Assemblyman Mike Gipson of Carson.\n\nBrown has vetoed plans to ban smoking and tobacco use on public university campuses in California.\n\nThe governor announced Monday that he took action on legislation that would have banned tobacco use on all 136 California State University and community college campuses. It would have prohibited chewing, dipping, smoking or vaping natural or synthetic tobacco products at the schools, which have about 2.5 million students and 100,000 staff and faculty.\n\nThe bill would have allowed school trustees and board members to decide whether to fine campus smokers up to $100. In a veto message, the Democratic governor noted that the schools\' governing boards already have that authority \"and are fully capable of setting smoking policies on their campuses.\"\n\nThe money would have gone to support education programs at the campus where the violation occurred. Supporters said the bill would have helped decrease the harmful effects of nicotine and secondhand smoke.\n\nThe governor earlier this year approved tougher tobacco regulations as part of a special legislative session on health care, including boosting the legal age to buy tobacco to 21 and extending existing regulations governing tobacco to electronic cigarettes.\n\nCalifornians also will weigh another attempt to raise taxes on cigarettes and other tobacco products at the November ballot box. Proposition 56 would raise the per-pack tax on cigarettes by $2 and raise taxes on other tobacco and vaping products.\n\nThe tobacco industry has launched ads against the measure and is expected to spend heavily to try to defeat it. AP\n\nBrown is rejecting legislation that would have required people caught paying for sex to spend at least 24 hours behind bars.Brown said in a veto message Tuesday that existing law provides enough flexibility to appropriately punish so-called \"johns.\"\n\nOn top of the mandatory jail time, the legislation would have required a fine of $250 to $1,000. The fine would be $1,000 to $10,000 for people who solicit sex from minors.\n\nThe Assembly and Senate approved the bill unanimously last month. It was written by Democratic Assemblywoman Lorena Gonzalez of San Diego. She said the Legislature should go after people who contribute to demand for prostitution. AP\n\nIn vetoing financial assistance for sex-crime victims, Brown says the state budget includes $19 million next year for similar services. AP\n\nBrown vetoed a bill requiring counties to notify voters if their vote-by-mail ballot was not counted, saying counties already publish that online.\n\nCalifornia Gov. Jerry Brown says two bills aimed at helping people recover from a massive gas leak in Southern California are unnecessary and is vetoing them.\n\nOne bill would have given residents near Aliso Canyon and other victims of man-made pollution an extra year to sue for relief.\n\nAB2748 also would have held polluters like Southern California Gas Co. liable even if they provide disaster relief or other interim payments to people harmed.\n\nBrown says that would eliminate the incentive for companies to settle legal disputes.\n\nHe writes in a veto message that nothing indicates current law is insufficient to hold polluters accountable. AP\n\nBrown rejected legislation to allow employees of some small businesses to take up to six weeks of unpaid leave to bond with a new child without losing their job or health insurance.\n\nBrown announced Friday that he vetoed the bill aimed at businesses with 20 to 49 employees.\n\nThe bill\'s author, Democratic Sen. Hannah-Beth Jackson of Santa Barbara, said employees could apply to a state program to receive partial wages.\n\nBrown says he vetoed SB654 because he\'s concerned about the impact on small businesses. The California Chamber of Commerce and other business groups said the law could create staffing shortages that hurt business operations.\n\nThe bill would have expanded an existing state law that applies to firms with 50 or more workers.\n\nBrown has vetoed a bill that would have required counties to offer in-person visitation for jail inmates.\n\nBrown said Tuesday that the legislation created a strict mandate and did not provide enough flexibility.Some county officials were concerned they\'d have to modify their facilities or hire additional jail staff.\n\nLos Angeles Democratic Sen. Holly Mitchell wrote the bill in response to the rising popularity of video conferences in place of in-person visitation. Mitchell said her bill would help reduce recidivism because inmates with strong connections to their families are less likely to commit new crimes.\n\nIn a veto message to lawmakers, Brown says he shares the concern and is directing a state agency to consider other ways to address the issue. AP\n\nHe also vetoed SB1304, which would have added environmental contamination to the reasons a property can be reassessed, as part of the legislation related to the Porter Ranch leak. Brown says state law already allows reassessments for changing market conditions.  AP\n\nBrown is vetoing a proposal to ban smoking at all state parks and beaches after having approved numerous anti-tobacco regulations earlier this year.\n\nThe bill would\'ve fined people up to $250 if they were caught smoking or disposing of tobacco products at state parks and beaches.\n\nBrown said Wednesday that a more measured and less punitive approach than SB1333 might be warranted.\n\nSupporters aimed to mitigate the harmful effects of nicotine and secondhand smoke. Democratic Sen. Marty Block of San Diego had argued it would also protect the environment from cigarette butts and prevent wildfires.\n\nBrown signed legislation earlier this year to raise the age to buy tobacco from 18 to 21, regulate electronic cigarettes and rein in tobacco use in various other ways.\n\nThis story has been updated.','2017-03-25 03:51:14'),(514,68,'7bace9490ce9923ccd476e829541bcf0f66d19676fca0c3554b02973ff0183da','cb84304104e34b9fb6652df4247dd1be','','','Fida has defended the controversial bill that aims to lower the age of sexual consent from 18 to 16.\n\nThe organisation says the bill seeks to protect teenage boys. Some residents signed a petition seeking to stop Parliament from lowering the age of sexual consent from 18 to 16. Others raised concerns using social media.\n\nIt is feared the amendment could lead to a rising number of teenage pregnancies and early marriages.\n\nCurrently, it is a crime to have sexual relations with someone under the age of 18.\n\nA person who commits the offence faces a jail term of not less than 15 years. Speaking to the Star yesterday, Fida national chairperson Josephine Mongare said some teenagers have unnecessarily suffered long sentences of between 15 to 20 years.\n\nIf you do an audit now in our prisons, you will find young boys of 20 and 21 years serving jail terms over sexual offences involving their peers and their life is ruined. This bill is meant to save teenage boys who suffer when it comes to sexual offences, she said.\n\nMongare said the law puts the names of sexual offenders on a permanent register and this has ruined teenagers lives.\n\nOnce you are profiled on the sexual offenders register, then you are unlucky and limited. Think of a person who is 19 or 20 years old. Their life is ruined because the register is permanent, she said. Mongare said the bill calls for lenience and considers the age gap between the offender and the victim.\n\nIf the age gap is two or three years, the court will be considerate in passing its judgment and looking at ways to do so without ruining the life of the boy. But if the man is 25 years old and above, the court will be able to determine the person knew he was dealing with a child, and judgment can be passed, she said.\n\nThe age of consent varies in various countries. In Angola, the age of consent is 12, while in Burkina Faso, it is 13. The proposed change in age is contained in the amendment to the Sexual Offences Act.\n\nMongare said, The boy child has become the unintended victim of the Sexual Offences Act. A lot of teenagers are in relationships without their parents knowledge.

Society has changed and it might be reasonable to ask why do we still stick at 16. I think there is scope for looking at lowering the age of consent.\'\n\nHis comments come after Terry Grange, chief constable of Dyfed-Powys Police, recently suggested that men as old as 30 who have sex with underage girls should not necessarily be classed as paedophiles.\n\nMr Grange argued there was a distinct difference between underage sex cases where the girl is barely in her teens, or younger, and those where she is nearing the age of consent.\n\nThe married father-of-three said: \'I don\'t personally adhere to the 15-year-old being with a 20-year-old boyfriend being paedophilia, or even if the boyfriend is 30.\'\n\nHe was criticised for giving the \'green light\' to child molesters and other abusers. And Hugh McKinney, of the National Family Campaign, attacked the latest demands from Mr Murray as \'nonsense\'.\n\nHe said: \'Increased calls by police for reducing the age of consent is nothing short of a paedophile\'s charter.\n\n\'The only way to adequately protect vulnerable, developing young children is to end this interference and meddling and make sure that they have the full protection the law can possibly afford until they are physically mature, developed and mentally able to make the correct moral decisions on their own behalf.\'\n\nBarnardos chief executive, Martin Narey, added: \'There needs to be extreme caution when discussing changes in this area as there is always the potential for more children to be at risk of exploitation by adults.\'\n\nThe age of consent is currently 16 and anyone who has sex with a younger child has committed an offence. If the victim is under 12, it is classed as rape. If the victim is over 13 and consents, it is unlawful sexual intercourse.\n\nHowever, official government guidance on prosecuting suggests that two teenagers who have sex with each other when one is below 16 should not necessarily be taken to court.\n\nEuropean countries including Austria, Bulgaria and Croatia set the age of consent at 14. It is 13 in Spain.\n\nMr Murray pointed to countries such as Canada and Austria, where 14-year-olds can have sex legally and Spain, where the age of consent is 13.\n\nHe told the Scottish Sunday Times: \'When you look at countries such as Canada and Spain, we consider them as comparable societies yet they have a lower age of consent.\n\n\'I certainly think there is scope for looking at (lowering the age of consent) and why is there this contradiction with other countries which we regard as similar societies to our own?\n\n\'I think it\'s of interest that (the age of consent in Scotland) is 16 and has been since 1885.

This new law will do away with that age-gapprovision.\n\nIn all states, dating, hugging, holding hands and kissing are not illegal. In some states, fondling, groping through close or other such things known as third-base is illegal. This new law will make any and all contact legal as long as the child is 13 years of age or older.

Nicolas Cage is not dead and he has not been involved in a motorcycle accident. And, the post is certainly not from CNN. The photograph in the post is stolen from news reportsabout a fatal motorcycle accident that occurred in theSan Diego area back in 2011. The accident depicted is in no way associated with Nicolas Cage. The message text even misspells Cages name, referring to him as Nicholas rather than Nicolas.\n\nIf you click on the post in the hope of reading more information about the actors sad demise, you will be taken to a decidedly dodgy website.\n\nThe site throws up multiple popup windows claiming that your computer is infected with viruses and advising you to click a button to deal with the alleged infections. If you do click, a scan will run and then present you with a list of viruses that it supposedly found on your computer. It will then claim that you must pay a fee to download software to remove the viruses. However, in reality, the scan is fake and it did not really find any viruses. Such rogue antivirus schemes are designed to trick people into paying fees forutterly useless software.\n\nOther links on the fake-news website, including the play button on a fake Nicolas Cage RIP video, open variousspammy websites.

Still others open adult dating websites.\n\nCelebrity death scam websites like the one described here are increasingly common. Be wary of any social media post that claims that a famous person hasdied unless the post comes from a trusted source. It is wise to independently verify the information via legitimate news sources before clicking on such messages.

Image on the right was the actual news, while the image on the left was the hoax news. (doc.twitter/tempo)\n\nTEMPO.CO, Jakarta- Annus horribilis. This was a horrible year for the spread of hoax reports. The government needs to respond seriously to this problem, because the destructive power of false reports has become increasingly worrying. Prejudice, provocation, hatred and mistrust are entering into people\'s personal lives. This bogus information is easily spread on social media.\n\nThe eerie effects of such fake reports can be seen in at least two instances in this nation. The first was the burning of a Buddhist temple and pagoda in Tanjung Balai, North Sumatra, in July. Locals quickly formed an angry mob, following a provocative report on social media. The second occurrence was in Depok, West Java, in the middle of December last year. Two people were killed and one seriously injured as a result of a brawl sparked by unconfirmed reports.\n\nThere is nothing new about this torrent of bogus information. During the 2014 presidential election campaign, Joko Widodo was reported as being descended from a member of the banned Communist Party of Indonesia. Even after he was elected, this fake report continued to appear. Rumors ranged from Obama walking out on Jokowi when he spoke at an international forum, to the firing of the Indonesian Military (TNI) commander, calls for people to withdraw cash from ATMs and the exaggeration of workers flooding in from China.\n\nThere are a few ways of looking at this persistent flow of hoax reports. Technological advances, the social media revolution and the improving quality of the Internet make it easier for everyone to access and produce information. This flood of information, unfortunately, is not balanced by an improvement in critical thinking. As a result, many people are easily angered by provocative headlines, who then share these bogus reports without really checking out the content. Such people are known as clicking monkeys, like the animals who like to throw bananas in all directions.\n\nAnother reason for the rise in hoax reports is the growth in mistrust of the mainstream media. There is a perception that the major media, mostly owned by tycoons, is no longer independent because it is rife with business and political interests.\n\nPeople who think in this way, unfortunately turn to websites that publish hoax reports. The result is an environment filled with agitative messages.\n\nIn general, there are two major groups who spin these false reports. First, there are private accounts and sites affiliated with political parties. They persistently \"cook\" the news for the benefit of the organizations they represent. Among this group are Portal Piyungan (initially named PKS Piyungan), VOA Islam and Era Islam, which have been blocked by the Communication and Informatics Ministry. World Traffic data shows that before it was blocked, the Piyungan website attracted 300,000 visitors daily. It netted advertising revenue of US$100 per day, US$36,500 per year or Rp485 million per year.\n\nThe second group are websites designed as profit-making entities. Posmetro, Nusanews and NBCIndonesia belong to this group. They have been blocked by the government based on Communication and Informatics Ministerial Regulation No. 19/2004 on a Healthy Internet. This type of website mixes fact and fiction, and adds provocative titles and opinions. Research carried out by the Anti-Hoax Research Community shows that such sites can bring in tempting advertising revenues of Rp600 million to 700 million per year.\n\nThis is not just an Indonesian phenomenon. Donald Trump\'s victory in the US presidential election is believed to be linked to large-scale misinformation. In the days leading up to the November 8 vote, there were reports that the Pope supported Trump. Then there was a rumor that an FBI agent investigating the leak of Hillary Clinton\'s e-mails had been murdered. There was no truth in either report, but millions of people shared them on Facebook and Twitter. It turned out that the hoax reports had been produced by teens in Macedonia in order to make money from the advertising.\n\nThe temptation of these advertising revenues lure more than a few owners of private accounts and websites to play around with the facts. The international community has strongly condemned Facebook and Google AdSense, which allow fake news to poison public life. Facebook has responded to this criticism by launching a software to detect hoax reports. The German government has even fined Facebook the equivalent of Rp7 billion for every hoax story shared on its site.\n\nWe too are starting to take action against the wave of false reports. Several campaigns have begun, such as education and media literacy improvement, anti-hoax groups and websites that help check the validity of reports. It is important that we support these anti hoax-news campaigns.\n\nBut movements alone are not enough. The government must try harder to clear away this fog of misinformation. There must be consistency. We must not have a situation where five sites are blocked, but dozens others are allowed to flourish. If necessary, the government would be wise to consider the German example, and slap massive fines on social media platforms that spread hoax reports.

In the past, Balinese women often wore only sarongs that did not cover their chests.\n\n\"We\'re just going to leave (the statues) as they are, we don\'t have to cover up anything because it is our culture,\" Bali local government spokesman Dewa Mahendra told AFP.\n\nHe said that they \"are cultural creations, they are art\".\n\nLocal authorities had not received a request from the Saudi king or his party to hide any of statues from view, Mahendra said, adding they were more focused on ensuring the monarch\'s safety.\n\nStrict interpretations of Islam forbid the creation of images of living beings - such as statues of women - and worship of idols.\n\nThe king and his entourage are staying in five luxury hotels for the holiday, which ends on Sunday.\n\nOther places have hidden naked statues for visiting Muslim leaders.

The seventh Saudi Arabian king will be in Indonesia for a state visit from March 1 to 9.\n\nThe special occasion is highly celebrated as the last time a Saudi king visited Jakarta was in 1970, when King Faisal bin Abdulaziz Al Saud visited the country.\n\nPrior to the king\'s visit, the government has implemented several measures to ensure his safety and comfort. Here are 10 interesting facts about King Salman\'s trip to Indonesia.\n\nKing Salman\'s visit to Indonesia is part of his six-nation Asian tour. According to the Gulf News, the tour kicked off in Malaysia on Feb. 26. Indonesia is King Salman\'s second destination before travelling to Japan, China, the Maldives and Jordan.\n\nThe king apparently favors to travelling in a large group. BBC News reported that during the king\'s French holiday, he came with a total of 1,000 family members and friends. This time around, King Salman will be accompanied an entourage of 1,500 people, including 10 ministers and 25 princes.\n\nThe 25 princes have been one of the most talked about topics on social media. Among them are Prince Khalid bin Fahd bin Mohammed, Prince Mansour bin Saud, Prince Mohammed bin Fahd, Prince Talal bin Saud, Prince Khalid bin Bandar, Prince Sattam bin Saud, Prince Faisal bin Khalid bin Sultan, Prince Mansour bin Muqren, Prince Mohammed bin Abdurrahman, Prince Ahmed bin Fahd bin Salman, Prince Abdulrahman bin Badr, Prince Saud bin Salman, Prince Naif bin Salman and Prince Rakan bin Salman. Antara news agency reported that Prince Faisal bin Khalid bin Sultan and Prince Abdulrahman bin Badr are active on social media.\n\nDue to the size of the group, King Salman will be flying in with seven planes, which includes six Boeing planes and one Hercules.\n\nAntara news agency reports that King Salman and his entourage will be staying in four hotels during his visit in Jakarta, namely The Westin Jakarta, Raffles Hotel Jakarta, Ritz-Carlton Jakarta Mega Kuningan and JW Marriott. In The Westin Jakarta, his entourage have rented 200 rooms.\n\nKing Salman is scheduled to have a bilateral meeting with President Joko \"Jokowi\" Widodo at the Bogor State Palace in Bogor, West Java, on March 1. During the short trip, King Salman and his entourage will be joining Jokowi for lunch. The lunch menu is said to comprise a wide array of local and Middle Eastern cuisine, such as nasi kebuli (rice cooked in spices).\n\nPresidential Secretariat head Darmansjah Djumala told kompas.com that the local foods would consist grilled seafood, traditional desserts and fruits.\n\n\"[We will] introduce [them] to the local fruits. [As] we have many [variations] of fruits,\" said Darmansjah.\n\nKing Salman\'s official visit is slated to run from March 1 to 3. On March 4 to 9, the king and his entourage are set to spend time in Bali. Bali Governor Made Mangku Pastika said the king only wanted rest in Bali. Up to 100 security personnel will reportedly safeguard King Salman during his six-day visit in Bali. This holiday is expected to attract more Saudi Arabian tourists to the destination.\n\nThe king\'s safety is important, hence the National Police have prepared 10,000 personnel, including soldiers from the military, to secure the visit. The joint security team officers will be stationed in three locations, namely Jakarta, Bogor and Bali.\n\nPrior to his visit, King Salman has reportedly sent some of his belongings to Jakarta and Bali. With a total weight of 450 tons, his cargo includes two units of Mercedes-Benz S600 and two electric lifts. PT Jasa Angkasa Semesta (JAS) president director Adji Gunawan said of the cargo, 63 tons would be unloaded at the Halim Perdanakusuma Airport, while the remaining 396 tons would be brought to the Ngurah Rai International Airport in Denpasar, Bali.\n\nOn March 2, the king is scheduled to give a 10-minute speech at the House of Representatives (DPR) in Senayan, South Jakarta, and visit the Istiqlal Mosque. In addition to security, special equipment has also been arranged at the two places. The House has prepared a portable ramp and a special chair according to the 81-year-old king\'s request. Meanwhile, the Istiqlal Mosque has installed an elevator and added a new toilet. The elevator is meant to transport the king to the second floor, where he will be practicing a Sunnah (non-obligatory) prayer.\n\nRead also:Indonesia parliament prepares for Saudi King Salman\'s visit\n\nSaudi king signs range of deals in Indonesia at start of visit','2017-03-25 03:51:14'),(536,70,'7fc876724ea4f034fc1bd144027e159e942726dfbb13cb849bd92464f4786ffd','92d9f63dff6d4afa840aa0e77a8e4a75','','','Airfreight service provider PT Jasa Angkasa Semesta (JAS) said that it was handling 459 tons of cargo containing equipment carried by Saudi Arabia\'s King Salman bin Abdulaziz al-Saud during his visit to IndonesiaMarch 1 to 9.\n\nJAS president director Adji Gunawan said of the cargo, 63 tons would be unloaded at the Halim Perdanakusuma airport in East Jakarta, while the remaining 396 tons would be brought to the Ngurah Rai International Airport in Denpasar, Bali.\n\nWe have been officially appointed to handle all [cargo] belonging to the kings entourage aircraft, Adji was quoted by Antara.\n\nAmong the special cargo were two units of Mercedes-Benz S600, which arrived in Denpasar on Feb. 18, one electric lift that arrived in Halim on Feb. 21, another electric lift that arrived in Denpasar on Feb. 22 along with other equipment.\n\nKings entourage of 620 people would be arriving in Indonesia from Feb. 15-28.\n\nAccording to Adji, aside from his entourage, King Salman will bring along 800 delegates, including ministers, and 25 princes, who will be arriving from Feb. 15 to March 4 in 27 flights to Halim Perdanakusuma and nine flights to Ngurah Rai.\n\nAdji said that his company would deploy 178 workers in Jakarta and 394 workers in Denpasar.

By conflating the two, she treated what was effectively advocacy on behalf of an individual officer as an official statement by a police department; while police departments are of course capable of being deceptive themselves, they are at least in theory accountable to a city council and mayor.\n\nThe claim, it turns out, is also wildly incorrect. The Charlotte Observer (9/23/16), a local newspaper, engaged in actual journalism by reviewing police records of those detained during Wednesdays unrest. It found that roughly 21 percent of arrestees were from outside of Charlotte, most of whom were from nearby areas:\n\nOf the 43 people arrested late Wednesday night and early Thursday morning, 34or 79 percentlive in Charlotte, the Observer found. Most of the others live elsewhere in North Carolina, including Albemarle, Gastonia and Greensboro. Three others were arrested Thursday night; of those, two were from Charlotte and the third had not been identified by mid-afternoon Friday. I didnt quote facts, Todd Walther, spokesman for the Charlotte/Mecklenburg Fraternal Order of Police told the Observer on Friday.\n\nIn other words, he simply made it up. And Burnett, if she had any sense of history, should have known better. Setting aside the fact that as a rule, police shouldnt be allowed to assert self-serving figures without follow-up questioning, the outside agitator line is a very common trope used by police and anti-protest pundits for decades. The objective is to treat unrest as a foreign invasion unconnected to organic, populist anger at the local government and police force. Indeed, it was routinely used by Jim Clark, the infamous sheriff of Clark County, Alabama, who in 1965 accused the Selma marchers of being mostly agitators, and 75 percent pro-communist or communist themselves:\n\nThe irony of the outside agitator cliche is that it applies more to the police, who often dont live in the neighborhoods they ostensibly protect. As AlterNets Max Blumenthal noted after the Baltimore unrest in April 2015, over 70 percent of the Baltimore Police Department did not live in Baltimoremaking the the police more outside than the protestors.\n\nBurnett tweeted out a semi-correction late Friday evening, but only because the Charlotte/Mecklenburg Police officially confirmed the totals after the Charlotte Observer called them on the police union lie. But the damage has already gone viral on right-wing media, cementing an old smear of civil rights activists as brand-new conventional wisdom.\n\nAdam Johnson is a contributing analyst for FAIR.org.

Sometimes, the people who come from beyond the region are there because they believe in the message or mission of the protests.

But we\'ll get to that later.\n\nThe Dwarfs also live together in squalor in the middle of the enchanted forest, which is very suspicious. Their house is so filthy that poor Snow White has no choice but to enlist forest critters to help her in cleaning it. What can they be hiding? Virtually all they do is dig for diamonds and precious gems, but they\'re a group of men living together in one small house. And most of them have the facial hair of someone who has been alive for a decent number of decades.

In years past, this has meant buying notebooks and pencils, perhaps even a new backpack. But over the past decade or so, the back-to-school checklist has for many also included an array of screen devices that many parents dutifully stuff into their childrens bag.\n\nThe screen revolution has seen pedagogy undergo a seismic shift as technology now dominates the educational landscape. In almost every classroom in America today, you will find some type of screensmartboards, Chromebooks, tablets, smartphones. From inner-city schools to those in rural and remote towns, we have accepted tech in the classroom as a necessary and beneficial evolution in education.\n\nTech in the classroom not only leads to worse educational outcomes for kids, which I will explain shortly, it can also clinically hurt them. Ive worked with over a thousand teens in the past 15 years and have observed that students who have been raised on a high-tech diet not only appear to struggle more with attention and focus, but also seem to suffer from an adolescent malaise that appears to be a direct byproduct of their digital immersion. Indeed, over two hundred peer-reviewed studies point to screen time correlating to increased ADHD , screen addiction , increased aggression , depression , anxiety and even psychosis .\n\nBut if thats true, why would we have allowed these educational Trojan horses to slip into our schools? Follow the money.\n\nEducation technology is estimated to become a $60 billion industry by 2018 . With the advent of the Common Core in 2010, which nationalized curriculum and textbooks standards, the multi-billion-dollar textbook industry became very attractive for educational gunslingers looking to capitalize on the new Wild West of education technology. A tablet with educational software no longer needed state-by-state curricular customization. It could now be sold to the entire country.\n\nThis new Gold Rush attracted people like Rupert Murdoch, not otherwise known for his concern for American pedagogy, who would go on to invest over $1 billion into an ed-tech company called Amplify, with the stated mission of selling every student in America their proprietary tabletfor only $199along with the software and annual licensing fees.\n\nAmplify hired hundreds of videogame designers to build educational videogameswhile they and other tech entrepreneurs attempted to sell the notion that American students no longer had the attention span for traditional education. Their solution: Educate them in a more stimulating and engaging manner.\n\nBut lets look more closely at that claim. ADHD rates have indeed exploded by 50 percent over the past 10 years with the CDC indicating that rates continue to rise by five percent per year. Yet many researchers and neuroscientists believe that this ADHD epidemic is a direct result of children being hyper-stimulated . Using hyper-stimulating digital content to engage otherwise distracted students exacerbates the problem that it endeavors to solve. It creates a vicious and addictive ADHD cycle: The more a child is stimulated, the more that child needs to keep getting stimulated in order to hold their attention.\n\nMurdochs Amplify wasnt the only dubious ed-tech cash-grab. The city of Los Angeles had entered into a $1.3 billion contract in 2014 to buy iPads loaded with Pearson educational software for all of its 650,000 K through 12 studentsuntil the FBI investigated its contract and found that now-former Superintendent John Deasy had a close relationship with Apple and Pearson executives. (Before the deal was killed in December 2014, the Pearson platform had incomplete and essentially worthless curriculum and such feeble security restrictions students that bypassed them in weeks.)\n\nDespite the Amplify and LA debacles, others still seek to convince nave school administrators that screens are the educational panacea. Yet as more American schools lay off teachers while setting aside scarce budget dollars for tech, many educators and parents alike have begun to ask: Do any of these hypnotic marvels of the digital age actually produce better educational outcomes for the kids who use them?\n\nWe could look to Finland, whose school system routinely ranks toward the top globally and has chosen to skip the tech and standardized testing. Instead, Finnish students are given as many as four outdoor free-play breaks per day , regardless of the weatherwhile here, a sedentary American child sitting in front of a glowing screen playing edu-games while over-scheduled and stressed by standardized testing is seen as the Holy Grail.\n\nDr. Kentaro Toyama, an associate professor at the University of Michigans School of Information, once believed that technology in the classroom could solve the problems of modern urban education. No Luddite, he had received his Ph.D. in computer science from Yale and had moved to India in 2004 to help found a new research lab for Microsoft; while there, he became interested in how computers, mobile phones and other technologies could help educate Indias billion-plus population.\n\nRather than finding a digital educational cure, he came to understand what he calls technologys Law of Amplification : technology could help education where its already doing well, but it does little for mediocre educational systems. Worse, in dysfunctional schools, it can cause outright harm. He added: Unfortunately, there is no technological fixmore technology only magnifies socioeconomic disparities, and the only way to avoid that is non-technological.\n\nThe list of supporting education experts and researchers is long:\n\nThere has also been surprising research coming out of Canada: Students dont even prefer e-learning over traditional education. In a 2011 study, researchers found that students actually preferred ordinary, real-life lessons to using technology. Those results surprised the researchers: It is not the portrait that we expected, whereby students would embrace anything that happens on a more highly technological level. On the contrarythey really seem to like access to human interaction, a smart person at the front of the classroom.\n\nWe are projecting our own infatuation with shiny technology, assuming our little digital natives would rather learn using gadgetswhile what they crave and need is human contact with flesh-and-blood educators.\n\nSchools need to heed this research in order to truly understand how to best nurture real intrinsic learning and not fall for the Siren song of the tech companiesand all of their hypnotic screens.','2017-03-25 03:51:14'),(556,73,'92ae0a0319e63936ade4eba7c605a6fafe45befb69ef0de339c0247b8a1307cf','aad6dd40ce6c489e86b8a529deb56b88','','','Facebook is warning users to avoid ahoax story claiming that Brad Pitt committed suicide.\n\nHackers, preying on the publics interest in all things Pitt and Angelina Jolie, have embedded malware into a fake story that, if clicked on, could expose sensitive information.\n\nThe article, posing as a FOX News story, shows a black and white picture of Pitt with long hair and the wordsR.I.P.

Terahertz waves pass through non-conducting materials such as clothes , paper, wood and brick and so cameras sensitive to them can peer inside envelopes, into living rooms and frisk people at distance.\n\nThe way terahertz waves are absorbed and emitted can also be used to determine the chemical composition of a material. And even though they dont travel far inside the body, there is great hope that the waves can be used to spot tumours near the surface of the skin.\n\nWith all that potential, its no wonder that research on terahertz waves has exploded in the last ten years or so.\n\nBut what of the health effects of terahertz waves? At first glance, its easy to dismiss any notion that they can be damaging. Terahertz photons are not energetic enough to break chemical bonds or ionise atoms or molecules, the chief reasons why higher energy photons such as x-rays and UV rays are so bad for us.

Every day travelers are herded through the checkpoint corrals into one of these anti-terrorism full body scanners. The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) claims these so-called advanced imaging technology devices are just as safe as traditional metal detectors. But is this really true?\n\nWhen they were first rolled out post-911, backscatter X-ray tunnels quickly became standard fare at commercial aviation facilities nationwide. The TSA claimed the amount of low-intensity radiation emitted by these machines was safe, releasing less than 10 microREMs of radiation per screening. This is an amount equivalent to what an airplane passenger might incur after just two or three minutes of flying at cruising altitude.\n\nThis claim was later debunked. It was revealed that concentrated radiation blasted directly at a persons body is much more harmful than the random patterns of ionizing radiation sent in all directions from the cosmos and by an airplanes navigational equipment during flight. Not long after these facts came to light, the TSA came up with a different type of screening technology that it said was safer  the millimeter wave machine.\n\nAccording to the TSAs Frequently Asked Questions page, millimeter wave imaging technology uses harmless electromagnetic waves to detect potential threats, which are highlighted on a generic outline of a person appearing on a monitor attached to the unit. If no anomalies are detected, an OK appears on the screen with no outline.\n\nIt all seems simple enough, right? Unfortunately, this explanation by the TSA is trite at best, and deliberately misleading at worst. A closer look into millimeter wave technology and the ways in which it affects the human body during an average TSA screening reveals a truth that the government doesnt want you to know. The doses of electromagnetic radiation emitted by the TSAs millimeter wave technology machines can cause cancer.\n\nThe fact that millimeter wave technology is used in the treatment of skin cancer (due to its known skin-heating properties), means it undeniably has an effect on human cells. This heating is a direct result of microwave frequencies entering the skin and inducing a certain level of atomic motion within the cellular structure. This is really just a fancy way of saying that millimeter wave radiation microwaves your skin.\n\nJust how much this millimeter wave radiation microwaves your skin is where push comes to shove. But most scientists are in agreement that any amount of radiation poses at least some level of risk. The public deserves to know both this level of risk and what they can do to minimize or eliminate it.\n\nThough not ionizing in nature, millimeter wave radiation is still potentially damaging to the human body. A 2012 paper published in the journal Radiation Research admits that the safety of millimeter wave body scanners is difficult-to-impossible to prove using publicly accessible data. This means that TSA claims of negligible risk associated with their use represent the opinion of the TSA, and not scientific fact.\n\nWhat we do know is that millimeter waves, which exist in the 30-300 GHz range, cause multiple biological effects, according to another study published the same year in the International Journal of Oncology. Though this study looked specifically at millimeter wave radiation in the context of cancer treatment, the morphological effects demonstrated reveal that this supposedly safe form of radiation causes cellular change that inhibit cellular growth.\n\nLike all other forms of radiation, millimeter waves dont differentiate between healthy cells and malignant cells. Whatever cells theyre targeted at are the cells they destroy. In the case of concentrated radiation blasts from millimeter wave body scanners, it means every cell on the surface of your body.\n\nWhat this all means is that millimeter wave body scanners act as giant microwaves that literally heat travelers bodies at the cellular level using ultra-high frequencies not normally found in nature. Microwave ovens operate at nearly the same frequencies as these machines. They induce cellular vibrations strong enough to generate heat in food, so imagine what its doing to your skin.\n\nBut these are just minor thermal effects, you might be thinking, since an airport body scan only lasts a mere twoseconds or so as opposed to 30 seconds to a minute to warm a bowl of soup in a microwave oven. But the principle is still the same, especially when taking into account repeated exposures.\n\nAnd you also have to consider the non-thermal effects of millimeter wave radiation, which disrupt cellular communication in ways that science has yet to fully delineate. The United States Air Force conducted its own research into ultra-high frequency, non-ionizing radiation as a potential weapons technology. Interestingly, in the process they uncovered evidence that the non-thermal activity of millimeter wave radiation directly interferes with the bodys ability to protect and heal itself.\n\nA World Health Organization (WHO) report adds even more to the conversation, revealing that millimeter waves not only heat the skin but also damage eyesight and cause cancer, particularly cancer of the skin.\n\nA team of researchers from the Center for Nonlinear Studies at the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico recognized the lack of scientific research into this questionable technology. They decided to investigate for themselves how high-frequency terahertz (THz) waves, like the kind emitted from the TSAs millimeter wave full body scanners, affect human DNA. They learned that:\n\nTHz waves  unzip double-stranded DNA, creating bubbles in the double strand that could significantly interfere with processes such as gene expression and DNA replication.\n\nRecognizing these inherent dangers, the best thing air travelers can do is opt out of the TSA screening process when presented with a body scanner rather than a traditional metal detector. By choosing a manual pat-down, air travelers can minimize their radiation exposure and thus minimize therisk of developing cancer.\n\nThough physically invasive and admittedly unconstitutional, a physical pat-down is still better than being blasted with a concentrated vortex of electrical and magnetic energy. As it sweeps around your body, the full body scanner exposes each square centimeter of your body to about 0.013 milliwatts of radiation. Collectively, this is enough to induce gene mutations, nerve damage, sterility, and even cancer.\n\nLow levels (below 10 mW/cm2) of NIR (non-ionizing radiation) have been found to produce many adverse health effects in animals including temporary sterility, genetic changes, and changes in the transmission of nerve impulses, explains the Foundation for Advancement in Cancer Therapy (FACT).\n\nThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has found preliminary evidence that these low levels may affect the immune system, which means the body may be less able to fight off disease.','2017-03-25 03:51:14'),(567,74,'9412b5e80c142d04cb9f919be8681e0fce8a66967d4d60b2538ff150b4983cd1','cdf8719d80ff400c93df62779b43460b','','','The study emits serious concern about the consequential impacts of terahertz radiation on fetal development, cancer and fertility. Think about the thousands of people who were exposed to harmful levels of untested energy particles guised in the name of National Security. The militarys Active Denial weapon utilizes the millimeter wave technology to create a burning sensation on the surface of the skin using a 95 GHz (3.2mm wavelength) beam. However, the TSA states that we shouldn\'t worry about their millimeter waves because: Millimeter wave technology bounces harmless electromagnetic waves off the body to create the same generic image for all passengers.\n\nNow they want us to have faith in the replacement technology, millimeter wave digital strip search scanners are considered safe. Dont even think about believing it. The TSA has failed to efficiently test these devices for health and safety reasons. Unfortunately, in our world, security overtakes the sake of human safety. The millimeter wave technologies are created to fill innocent travelers with high-frequency energy particles referred to as terahertz photons. Boian S. Alexandrov from the Center for Nonlinear Studies at Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico, conducted a study that showed these terahertz waves could unzip double-stranded DNA, creating bubbles that could significantly interfere with processes such as gene expression and DNA replication.\n\nClearly not. First they say those X-ray scanners (that go on to show more naked body parts) were safe. Even the devices manufacturer, Rapidscan, openly admits that the scanners hadnt been adequately tested. Later on, the truth was revealed that those safety tests were rigged from the start, as reported by Natural News. With fake results, this technology was added into airports across the world. Scientists have warned about the radiation and how it isnt safe. It wasnt until the backscatter radiation levels that the scanners were giving off began causing cancer in TSA agents. After the increased cases of cancer in those agents, were yanked from airports.\n\nThis is inaccurate because the nature of millimeter waves is that our bodies and water are excellent absorbers of these waves. Millimeter waves do penetrate into our skin. At the microwave technology center in Malaysia, health subjects were exposed to microwave radiation between 20  38 GHz, the range in which the TSA scanners operate.\n\n \n\n They found that millimeter waves penetrated the subjects skin at depths of between 1.05 mm at 20 GHz to 0.78 mm at 38 GHz. This is enough to penetrate below the epidermal layer of the skin. Millimeter waves have been reported to produce a variety of bioeffects, many are quite unexpected from radiation penetrated less than 1 mm into body tissues.\n\nWhats of major concern is the studies that prove there is an irreversible water memory effect by millimeter waves operating in the 36GHz frequency, and the millimeter wave effects on blood plasma vary from one person to the other. Does this information make you feel uncomfortable yet? Well, it should make you scared. Since the day they first rolled out these harmful technologies in 2007, I have always chosen to opt out. I would rather go through intrusive body pat downs than put myself through DNA alteration.\n\nIts time for us to exercise our own personal body health consciousness, since the US government has blatantly demonstrated that they dont hold any worry about not protecting you. Alteration of your DNA can be deadly altogether. Who would ever formulate the connection that a TSA scanning machine might have been a contributing factor to the negative health effects you experience.\n\n \n\n If you are a frequent traveler, like myself, you should be very concerned about the levels of exposure to radiation. This past weekend, I was making it to a flight back to Los Angeles from the Columbia, South Carolina Airport, I chose the usual opt out option. The TSA agents from this little airport tried to feed me the propaganda line about minimal risk. I told them I had done my research and read the studies. They looked at me with blank stare trying to persuade me that it was just like using a cell phone. Not even remotely true.\n\nThe millimeter wave scanners the TSA operates, emit more than 20 billion times more oscillations per second in smaller terahertz waves, so the cellular effects will be much different from cell phones.\n\n \n\n Im positive that no one ever told TSA agents this, but they feed the same lies back to the people that theyve been told, so I tried to be forgiving and compliant.\n\nIm sure no one had requested an opt out for some time in this South Carolina airport, which is why I got the pat down of them all. The female agent made sure to give me karate chops straight up to my private parts twice in the back and then another two times in the front.\n\nI have had so many pat downs in my life, and no one, has ever been so intrusive as this one TSA agent was. My instinct was to correct her and explain to her the pat-down was inappropriate, then I remembered that my noncompliance would lead to me missing my flight back home. During this pat-down, she sneezed and sniffled, spreading her germs onto me through it all. I have to say, we all must be sick of this treatment in the sake for security. It has even been proven that these scanner devices and pat-downs arent effective in keeping us safe from terrorists.\n\nAirport security testers have hid everything from guns to explosives and passed them through, showing the these invasive technologies arent effective. Now, metal detectors would do the job. Honestly, if we all opted out of going through these scanners, the program would eventually go under. The opt out line would be so long that it would put the air travel industry into a head spin.\n\n \n\n It would convey a blatantly serious message that unsafe devices that emit harmful levels of radiation is totally unacceptable. If you care about your health and DNA, you would choose the opt-out choice. I may be ahead of you on what you thinkthat they will suspend our civil liberties and mandate travelers to enter through those scanner whether we want to or not.\n\nIf this were to happen, Im positive that lawsuits would happen and yet, there is an easy solution to all this. Visit a medical supplies store and purchase an inexpensive arm sling. Be sure to put this on before going through the TSA. When you cant hold your arms up high in the scanner, the results are deemed unusable. They know this and have to let you opt-out due to medical reasons,','2017-03-25 03:51:14'),(568,74,'9412b5e80c142d04cb9f919be8681e0fce8a66967d4d60b2538ff150b4983cd1','a31844486b644c0fa09ab518b17209d1','','','The waves have been found to unzip double-stranded DNA, creating bubbles in the double strand that could significantly interfere with processes such as gene expression and DNA replication.\n\nThe latest airport security trend is the backscatter x-ray machine, touted as a powerful way to virtually frisk a traveler for contraband without the embarassment of a strip search.\n\nThough touted as completely safe because the level of radiation is so low, travelers have been nervous about the devices  and not just because it shows off a nice outline of their privates to the people manning the machines  but because they remain scared of the health problems they might propose.\n\nLooks like a little healthy paranoia might have been a good thing.

He also carried a syringe containing a liquid accelerant to detonate the explosive.\n\nSince the attack was foiled, body-scanners, using \"millimetre-wave\" technology and revealing a naked image of a passenger, have been touted as a solution to the problem of detecting explosive devices that are not picked up by traditional metal detectors  such as those containing liquids, chemicals or plastic explosive.\n\nBut Ben Wallace, the Conservative MP, who was formerly involved in a project by a leading British defence research firm to develop the scanners for airport use, said trials had shown that such low-density materials went undetected.\n\nTests by scientists in the team at Qinetiq, which Mr Wallace advised before he became an MP in 2005, showed the millimetre-wave scanners picked up shrapnel and heavy wax and metal, but plastic, chemicals and liquids were missed.\n\nIf a material is low density, such as powder, liquid or thin plastic  as well as the passenger\'s clothing  the millimetre waves pass through and the object is not shown on screen. High- density material such as metal knives, guns and dense plastic such as C4 explosive reflect the millimetre waves and leave an image of the object.\n\nMr Wallace said: \"Gordon Brown is grasping at headlines if he thinks buying a couple of scanners will make us safer. It is too little, too late. Under his leadership, he starved the defence research budget that could have funded a comprehensive solution while at the same time he has weakened our border security.\n\n\"Scanners cannot provide a comprehensive solution on their own. We must now start to ask if national security demands the use of profiling.\"\n\nMr Wallace added that X-ray scanners were also unlikely to have detected the Christmas Day bomb.\n\nThe Government is looking at millimetre-wave scanners for widespread use in British airports as part of Mr Brown\'s review. They are safer to use than X-ray scanners because they do not emit radiation and do not require passengers\' consent. Pregnant women cannot go through X-ray scanners but there are no such health risks with millimetre-wave technology.\n\nHowever, a Whitehall source revealed that the DfT and the Home Office had already tested both the millimetre-wave and X-ray body-scanners as part of an ongoing assessment of airport security and anti- terror measures.\n\nBut the security scare has caused national governments and airports to renew their interest in body-scanners. Amsterdam\'s Schiphol airport, where Abdulmutallab changed flights en route from Nigeria to Detroit, is to activate 17 scanners it bought two years ago for flights to the US, despite EU advice that there are privacy and human rights issues.\n\nLast week the US Transportation Security Administration ordered $165m-worth of scanners, using both millimetre and X-ray technology, from L-3 Communications.\n\nQinetiq had developed a similar millimetre-wave body scanner, but is now developing a sophisticated \"stand-off\" scanner which does not pose any privacy issues as it does not show a body image. Materials hidden on a body reflect back signals, showing up as a red alert on screen. Kevin Murphy, product manager for physical security at Qinetiq, admitted this SPO system would also not have picked up the Christmas Day bomb, but insisted that it could be used as part of a \"layered approach\" to security in mass transportation, which would also include monitoring people\'s behaviour.\n\nMr Murphy echoed Mr Wallace\'s doubts over whether the millimetre-wave body scanners being discussed by the Government would have picked up Abdulmutallab\'s hidden explosive. He said: \"It is conjecture whether or not these methods would have seen through clothing. I don\'t think anyone knows.\"\n\nHe added: \"The solution is to acknowledge that there isn\'t a single technology out there that is an answer to the whole problem.\"\n\nEach full body-scanner costs around 100,000. However, opinion is divided among aviation experts. Writing in The Independent on Sunday, Chris Yates, Aviation Security Editor of Jane\'s Information Group, says: \"Body scanning (whether it be millimetre-wave or X-ray based and manufactured by any of the companies in this sector), has a significant role to play in enhancing UK airport security immediately.\n\n\"Body scanning is only half the story, though. The Government cannot ignore the liquid aspect any more. Liquid explosive became a high-agenda issue following the thwarted transatlantic bomb plot of 2006 and is clearly implicated in the attempted downing of Northwest Airlines Flight 253. If the Government skirts over this aspect it will be nothing short of a dereliction of duty.\"\n\nOn Friday, in an announcement on the Downing Street website, the Prime Minister said an urgent review of security at UK airports would be implemented.\n\nPromising to react quickly to the \"wake-up\" call of last week\'s attempted atrocity, Mr Brown added: \"In co-operation with President Obama and the Americans, we will examine a range of new techniques to enhance airport security systems beyond the traditional measures. These could include advancing our use of explosive trace technology, full body scanners and advanced X-ray technology.\"\n\nA spokesman for BAA, which owns six UK airports, including Heathrow, said on Friday: \"Any comprehensive review of airport security should involve government and the aviation industry, and should establish how a combination of technology, intelligence and the profiling of passengers can build a better defence against the unpredictable and changing threat from international terrorism.\"\n\nResponding to Mr Wallace\'s claims, a DfT spokesman said: \"Body-scanners are being assessed urgently as part of a package of measures to respond to the latest incident. Trials of body-scanners have already taken place and these are being assessed urgently as part of an immediate review of airport security.\"\n\nIn the US, the \"pat-down\" search used by security staff was derided as ineffective  because officials are forbidden from frisking sensitive areas. Analyst Michael Boyd said: \"To have people hold up their arms and just pat them  like I\'m really going to carry a bomb down there. You know where you\'re going to put it, and no one\'s going to go there.\"\n\nMr Brown has also convened a meeting for 28 January on the terror threat posed by Yemen, where Abdulmutallab is alleged to have undergone terrorist training.\n\nIn a fresh announcement yesterday, Downing Street announced an emergency cabinet committee meeting with senior ministers and intelligence chiefs to discuss the UK\'s response to the attempted attack.\n\nNo 10 and the White House have agreed to step up efforts to tackle the emerging threat from Yemen and Somalia.','2017-03-25 03:51:14'),(570,74,'9412b5e80c142d04cb9f919be8681e0fce8a66967d4d60b2538ff150b4983cd1','4298256fc0744343af9490a7f7a22658','','','A new model of the way the THz waves interact with DNA explains how the damage is done and why evidence has been so hard to gather\n\nGreat things are expected of terahertz waves, the radiation that fills the slot in the electromagnetic spectrum between microwaves and the infrared. Terahertz waves pass through non-conducting materials such as clothes , paper, wood and brick and so cameras sensitive to them can peer inside envelopes, into living rooms and frisk people at distance.\n\nThe way terahertz waves are absorbed and emitted can also be used to determine the chemical composition of a material. And even though they dont travel far inside the body, there is great hope that the waves can be used to spot tumours near the surface of the skin.\n\nWith all that potential, its no wonder that research on terahertz waves has exploded in the last ten years or so.\n\nBut what of the health effects of terahertz waves? At first glance, its easy to dismiss any notion that they can be damaging. Terahertz photons are not energetic enough to break chemical bonds or ionise atoms or molecules, the chief reasons why higher energy photons such as x-rays and UV rays are so bad for us. But could there be another mechanism at work?\n\nThe evidence that terahertz radiation damages biological systems is mixed. Some studies reported significant genetic damage while others, although similar, showed none, say Boian Alexandrov at the Center for Nonlinear Studies at Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico and a few buddies. Now these guys think they know why.\n\nAlexandrov and co have created a model to investigate how THz fields interact with double-stranded DNA and what theyve found is remarkable. They say that although the forces generated are tiny, resonant effects allow THz waves to unzip double-stranded DNA, creating bubbles in the double strand that could significantly interfere with processes such as gene expression and DNA replication. Thats a jaw dropping conclusion.\n\nAnd it also explains why the evidence has been so hard to garner. Ordinary resonant effects are not powerful enough to do do this kind of damage but nonlinear resonances can. These nonlinear instabilities are much less likely to form which explains why the character of THz genotoxic\n\neffects are probabilistic rather than deterministic, say the team.\n\nThis should set the cat among the pigeons. Of course, terahertz waves are a natural part of environment, just like visible and infrared light. But a new generation of cameras are set to appear that not only record terahertz waves but also bombard us with them. And if our exposure is set to increase, the question that urgently needs answering is what level of terahertz exposure is safe.\n\nRef: arxiv.org/abs/0910.5294: DNA Breathing Dynamics in the Presence of a Terahertz Field','2017-03-25 03:51:14'),(571,74,'9412b5e80c142d04cb9f919be8681e0fce8a66967d4d60b2538ff150b4983cd1','c1b8490c7ed34041a2e2cfff2e62f6e3','','','To paraphrase the actual scientists involved with the research: \"No.\" Source: www.snopes.com ] [ Comments ] [','2017-03-25 03:51:14'),(572,74,'9412b5e80c142d04cb9f919be8681e0fce8a66967d4d60b2538ff150b4983cd1','99a514f1d1a248beab5270a8b95d06a1','','','A study performed at the Los Alamos National Laboratory found that millimeter wave body scanners commonly used by airport security can alter your DNA.\n\nOn 19 February 2017, conspiracy and metaphysics web site Collective Evolutionpublished an article(titled Los Alamos Study Finds Airport Scanners Can Rip Apart & Alter DNA) that was written by Kathy J. Froti, a clinical psychologist with no professional background in biology or physics who claims to have been taught how key mathematical information affects the consciousness of the cells from multi-dimensional beings of light whose goal is to bring healing to our world after a near-death experience.\n\nIn that post, she reviews a litany of complaints aboutthe older backscatter x-ray scanners once employed by the Transportation Security Administration before diving into perceived health risks of the newer, millimeter wave technology:\n\nNow they also want us to believe that the replacement technology, millimeter wave digital strip search scanners, are also perfectly safe. Dont believe it for a second. [] These millimeter wave technologies are designed to bombard innocent travelers with high frequency energy particles known as terahertz photons. A study conducted by Boian S. Alexandrov et.al. at the Center for Nonlinear Studies at Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico, revealed that these terahertz waves could unzip double-stranded DNA, creating bubbles that could significantly interfere with processes such as gene expression and DNA replication.\n\nThe new technology Froti describes, referred to by the TSA as millimeter wave Advanced Imaging Technology, has been in common use at American airports since 2012. It works by bouncing electromagnetic waves of a specific frequency range called terahertz radiation, which is described in a 2007 report on its potential for security applications:\n\nTo support her argument that these devices are dangerous, she links to a 2009 MIT Technology Review article discussing a study (the Los Alamos study) that sought to address interactions between the natural frequencies present in the hydrogen bonds of DNA and a THz field:\n\nAt first glance, its easy to dismiss any notion that they can be damaging. Terahertz photons are not energetic enough to break chemical bonds or ionise atoms or molecules, the chief reasons why higher energy photons such as x-rays and UV rays are so bad for us. But could there be another mechanism at work? [] [Lead author of the study Boian] Alexandrov and co have created a model to investigate how THz fields interact with double-stranded DNA and what theyve found is remarkable. They say that although the forces generated are tiny, resonant effects allow THz waves to unzip double-stranded DNA, creating bubbles in the double strand that could significantly interfere with processes such as gene expression and DNA replication.\n\nBecause (and despite Frotis claim of high energy) these electric fields are not strong enough to actually cleave chemical bonds, they reasoned that another mechanism must be present if terahertz fields are to impart any biologic effect. In their study, Alexandrov and colleagues wanted to investigate the possibility that terahertz radiation, because it is similar in frequencies of energy holding hydrogen bonds together, could possibly interact in a way so as to amplify each others signals to the point where it could break chemical bonds:\n\nUltimately, the authors found that while unlikely, it is possible that, under a set of remarkably specific conditions, such a phenomenon is possible:\n\nWe have found that a THz field may cause dynamical separations of the DNA double strand. In the presence of weak perturbations e.g. thermal fluctuations, small amplitude response occurs (at half the driving frequency) either in a spatially uniform manner or, at higher frequencies, in an unusual spatially dimerized form. In the latter case, neighboring base pairs oscillate in an out-of-phase fashion. However, large localized openings (bubbles) in the DNA double strand can only occur via a nonlinear mechanism requiring a spatial perturbation above a certain amplitude threshold that is determined by the intensity and the frequency of the THz field.\n\nOne reason Froti may have avoided the study itself is that it makes no mention of airport scanners, although the MIT Technology Review article did use them as a news hook for its story. According to the actual authors of the paper, however, their research holds no relevance to airport scanners. In an e-mail, Alexandrov (the lead author of the Los Alamos study), told us:\n\nCo-author Anny Usheva reiterated this point via email as well:\n\nIndeed, she clarified that her research (on which she said they have made progress but are held up due to a lack of funding) aims to use THz radiation over much longer intervals of time to reprogram cells for regenerative medicine:\n\nThe work is collaborative with my lab at Harvard Medical School/presently at Brown and Los Alamos. We do the laser/THz part at Los Alamos. As a corresponding author of these publications, I am confident to say that there is a biological effect after 8 hours of continuous broad band (0.1-10 THz) exposure. Our goal at the moment is to achieve massive and fast reprogramming of cells (outside of the body) for the needs of the regenerative medicine.\n\nNeedless to say, an airport scanner does not expose travellers to eight hours of continuous radiation. The federally funded research and development center Pacific Northwest Laboratories highlightsthe actual time frame on a page describing the development of the TSAs scanners:\n\nThat same website, conveniently, lists all of the patents associated with the TSAs millimeter wave technology. While there areseveral frequency ranges associated with the methodologies patented to analyze millimeter data, the three patents that describe the actual device employed by TSA makes it clear that only a small fraction of the terahertz range is utilized, as described in the most recent patent filing:\n\nExpressed in GHz, the broadband exposure (i.e. multiple wavelengths at the same time) Usheva investigated was 100 to 10,000 GHz, a range that barely overlaps with with the TSAs stated range of 1 to 110 GHz, and a far cry from broad band terahertz radiation.\n\nThe authors of the study themselves refute the claims made by the Collective Evolution post and the study itself is, for all intents and purposes, irrelevant to the technology utilized by airport scanners. As such, we rate this claim as false.','2017-03-25 03:51:14'),(573,75,'a40758870e158e0583ceb93d083d6371e314a9cb544979ba613a05c67b8b07ac','44cd117a46e84c24aa69b97cafcbf9cd','','','At least they actually did some due diligence and tried calling the guy.

We\'ll know if he shows up in a few days or if they get a substitute.\n\nORIGIN:Since at least October 2016, some social media users have been echoing the belief that former Clinton Foundation CEO Eric Braverman is missing or in peril. Braverman, an attorney, headed the foundation from 2013 until he resigned that position in 2015.\n\nRumors regarding his whereabouts began swirling after a leaked document published via WikiLeaks showed his name mentioned in e-mails between Clinton staffers who believed he was furtively releasing information about the foundation\'s financial doings:\n\nEric Braverman, the Clinton Foundation CEO from 2013 until 2015, has apparently been missing since October. His absence has fueled speculations in the blogosphere but so far has been ignored by the media.\n\nSome speculate, with good reason, that Braverman may have gone into hiding after an email mentioning his name was released by Wikileaks on October 22 of this year. In the March 2015 email exchange, Center for American Progress President Neera Tanden told Clinton campaign manager and confidant John Podesta there was a mole within the Clinton Foundation. Podesta in his reply told Tanden the mole was Braverman.\n\nWe found no evidence that Braverman is currently a missing person, nor that he has gone into hiding. The only evidence being proffered in support of this claim is the fact that Braverman has not used his Twitter account since October, but that\'s hardly compelling since he is an infrequent user of that social media platform:\n\nThe last evidence of Bravermans public activity was October 12, when he posted his last tweet on Twitter. (Usually he tweets about once a month. His husband, Neil Brown, hasnt tweeted since August, although he rarely tweets.) I left a voicemail on Bravermans personal phone and sent him an email, but received no response. He is still listed as a lecturer at Yale University and, contrary to some reports, there is a record of his lectures going back several years. I contacted the press office and Bravermans department at Yale and received no response.\n\nThe Yale campus has been closed for the holidays, which is likely why no response was received by the writer quoted above. However, Braverman is listed by the university as teaching his \"Innovation in Government and Society\" class in both the Fall 2016 semester and the upcoming Spring 2017 semester. He also has an active voicemail and e-mail address at the university (but didn\'t respond to our messages).\n\nWe were unable to reach a New Haven, Connecticut, police spokesman, but New York City and Washington D.C. police have no record of a missing person with his name, nor is Braverman listed on NamUs, a national database of missing persons maintained by the Justice Department.\n\nThe conspiracy theory that the Clintons have killed or disappeared numerous people they find politically inconvenient has been swirling for decades, but it reached a new fever pitch during the 2016 presidential election. On 24 October 2016, the conspiracy-mongering web site WhatDoesItMean.com started a false rumor claiming Braverman, an attorney and businessman, had applied for asylum in Russia after his name was revealed in a WikiLeaks dump.','2017-03-25 03:51:14'),(574,75,'a40758870e158e0583ceb93d083d6371e314a9cb544979ba613a05c67b8b07ac','02b3b5005aef439b845bb26237509cb2','','','#WheresEric?

I have been keeping up with missing CEO Eric Braverman of the Clinton Foundation. It was first reported that he had taken refuge at the Russian Embassy in New York seeking asylum. He had been exposed in one of the WIKILEAKS Podesta emails as a mole within the Clinton Foundation. Chelsea Clinton had hired Braverman to clean house, but the old crew at the Foundation resented him being there. Bill Clintons handler Doug Bandsuch a creepwanted him out. He later resigned and was teaching at Yale, or he was supposed to do that. As far as I can see he had a meeting on October 30, 2016,but he did not attend the meeting. His last tweet was on October 12, 2016 ( erman/with_replies).\n\nBraverman wed Neil Brown, who also became involved with the Benghazi arms dealbear with me here, as this is a complicated story. It is not clear to me if Braverman knew of this before he married Brown. There are so many ins and outs in the Benghazi story.\n\nBut one thing that is very clear is Braverman did not know what he was stepping in to when he was hired by Chelsea Clinton to clean house at the Foundation.\n\n Doug Band, Bill Clintons right had man, did not want Bravermans intrusion into the criminal empire he had helped to build.\n\nEric Braverman was made the CEO of the Clinton Foundation in 2013, this report explains, after Hillary Clintons daughter, Chelsea, declared war on this criminal enterprise after stunning details emerged showing her father, former President Bill Clinton, had raised over $1 billion though the foundation to rebuild 100 villages in India, but only spent $53 million with him and his wife, Hillary Clinton, pocketing the rest. Braverman eventually went to NBC News and spoke with someone there about what he had found at the Foundation, telling them to follow the money. When WIKILEAKS dropped the Podesta emails, the world could see, as Braverman saw, Podesta knew Braverman was the mole inside the Foundation, or at least he was before resigning. At that point, Braverman disappeared, and the talk was he was seeking asylum at the Russian Embassy in New York. However, there was doubt in some circles this was true. As I was following the story very closely, eventually I found the following which made more sense to me:\n\nLast week, we reported the disappearance offormer CEO of the Clinton FoundationEric Braverman. Intel provided suggested that he fled the country fearing for his life, seekingasylum in Russia. That was nine days ago, and there has still been no word from (or sightings of) Eric Braverman. However, a new source within the intelligence community suggests that was misinformation intentionally spread through social media by several sources, and in fact, he is being held in protective custody by the FBI inexchange for his testimony against Hillary Clinton. In an email exchange, Neera Tanden the president of CAP, warned John Podesta to keep tabs on Doug Band who she thought was the insider who told NBC to follow the money and the find the real HRC scandal. John Podesta quickly wroteback to identify the real source as ormer Clinton Foundation CEO Eric Braverman which shocksTanden who replies, Holy Moses. This was in WikileaksEmail 25357: Of course, when Braverman heard of the above leak, he must have realized he had to do something, or he would end up in the CLINTON DEADPOOL. For all we know this could be true now. There is a man on YouTube who has been following the Eric Braverman story, along with the story of a missing arms dealer named Marc Turi. If you remember, Turi was set up as the fall guy for the Benghazi arms deal by Obama and Clinton.The DOJ was to prosecute Turi, but he went toFox News and told his story. Eventually the DOJ dropped the case. However, Turi was a very bold man, as he threatened to drop a bombshell on Clinton. Now he has disappeared, too. It is believed he could be a part of the CLINTON DEADPOOL.\n\nThe Obama administration is moving to dismiss charges against an arms dealer it had accused of selling weapons that were destined for Libyan rebels. Lawyers for the Justice Department on Monday filed a motion in federal court in Phoenix to drop the case against the arms dealer, an American named Marc Turi, whose lawyers also signed the motion. The deal averts a trial that threatened to cast additional scrutiny on Hillary Clintons private emails as Secretary of State, and to expose reported Central Intelligence Agency attempts to arm rebels fighting Libyan leader Moammar Qadhafi. Government lawyers were facing a Wednesday deadline to produce documents to Turis legal team, and the trial was officially set to begin on Election Day, although it likely would have been delayed by protracted disputes about classified information in the case. A Turi associate asserted that the government dropped the case because the proceedings could have embarrassed Clinton and President Barack Obama by calling attention to the reported role of their administration in supplying weapons that fell into the hands of Islamic extremist militants.\n\nThe above video was published on November 9, 2016 by George Webb. Webb is veryknowledgeable on Benghazi and the whole Clinton Foundation. He has made a series of videos on missing Eric Braverman, Marc Turi, Benghazi, and the Clinton Foundation. These videos are a wellspring of information, and I hope everyone who reads this report will watch the video, too.\n\nThe below site is a wellspring of information on Benghazi, Marc Turi, and Hillary Clinton. I do not see how Clinton is going to get away from what she has done. However, the latest is that Obama is going to pardon her. Yet, I feel eventually Benghazi will catch up to her. I just pray that Eric Braverman and Marc Turi have not ended up in the CLINTON DEADPOOL. I hope after reading this report, some attention will be called to Braverman and Turi.\n\nMost of our readers know that we were in Libya for 100 days during the illegal Clinton/NATO war against that country and that we were captured by Clintons Al Qaeda mercenaries, sentenced to death only to escape by 3 miracles. Recently there has been a lot of media covering Marc Turi, the man Hillary Clinton hired to figure a way to sneak weapons into Libya to arm her Al Qaeda mercenaries against the embargo by the UN. The plan was to run the arms through Qatar to wash the proof of where they had come from, well just so happens the Libyans Coast Guard captured some of the gun runners and they confessed everything. http://www.foxnews.com/ politics/2016/10/11/arms- dealer-says-administrati As proven by Marc Turis most recent interview with Fox News, the Clinton plan was to run guns through Qatar  thus the proof is in the video  these are Clintons illegal arms being supplied to radical Islamic terrorists, ending up in the hands of Al Qaeda, ISIS, Ansar Al Sharia, LIFG and other radical groups.

Braverman, M.D. (1957- ) is the founder and director of PATH Medical, a clinic that purports to focus on \"brain health.\" (PATH is an acronym for \"Place for Achieving Total Health.\") He is also the founder and president of PATH Foundation NY, a non-profit organization described on its Web site as \"devoted to establishing how the brain functions and using that information to develop practical diagnostic and treatment methods that improve wellbeing and increase longevity.\" [1] He also operates Total Health Nutrients, LLC, which markets dietary supplements online and within his office at 304 Park Avenue South in New York City. He hosts a weekly radio program and has written or co-authored about a dozen books about brain/body health and nutrition and a few on religious topics. A curriculum vitae posted on the PATH Medical Web site in 2014 described him as an \"accomplished, world-renowned doctor, researcher, author, television and radio personality specializing in neurology, biochemistry, anti-aging, longevity, total health and wellness.\" This report describes why I am skeptical about what he does.\n\nBraverman\'s current CV states that he received a bachelor of arts degree in general science from Brandeis University in 1979, graduated from New York University Medical School in 1983, and had \"postgraduate experience\" at Massachusetts General Hospital (1978-1979) and Greenwich Hospital (1983-1984). [2] The listing for Greenwich does not indicate whether it was for one or two years, but other sources indicate that it was one. The American Board of Medical Specialties (ABMS), which is the standard-setting organization for medical specialties, does not list him as board-certified. It\'s not clear how he could have had postgraduate experience at Massachusetts General Hospital before he graduated from college. Braverman is \"certified in anti-aging medicine\" by the American Board of Anti-Aging Medicine, but this board is not recognized by the ABMS. All ABMS-recognized boards require at least three years of full-time postgraduate training in an approved program. The Anti-Aging board has no such requirement.\n\nBraverman gives more detail about his early career in an article published in 1989 in the Journal of Orthomolecular Medicine, a publication that caters to practitioners who advocate using large doses of nutrients for treating schizophrenia and many other illnesses. At age 18, Braverman met and was impressed by Carl C. Pfeiffer, M.D., Ph.D. (1908-1988), who directed a megavitamin clinic called the Princeton Brain Bio Center. After completing his sophomore year at Brandeis, Braverman began helping Pfeiffer with research projects. He described his early association this way: \"I slept on the floor at work, lived in his house, lived in his office, lived in the house next to the office. I lived and ate his vision of medical conquest.\" After graduating from medical school, Braverman completed a 1-year internal medicine internship, then went to work at the Brain Bio Center, and later opened his own office in New Jersey. The article states that he was \"in trouble\" during his internship because of his unconventional ideas about nutrition [3].\n\nIn 1987, Braverman and Pfeiffer co-authored a book called The Healing Nutrients Within, which stated, \"Pfeiffer\'s LawWe have found that if a drug can be found to do the job of medical healing, a nutrient can be found to do the same job. When we understand how a drug works, we can imitate its action with one of the nutrients.\" [4] This claim is preposterous.\n\nFrom 1988 to 1996, Braverman was also a columnist for Total Health magazine, which promoted dietary supplements and many off-beat health approaches. During most of this period, the magazine\'s masthead identified him as \"Rabbi Eric R. Braverman, M.D.\" and listed him as a \"religion consultant.\" Neither his CV nor any other source I could find online indicate a basis for his use of this title.\n\nBraverman has been licensed to practice medicine in Alabama, Arizona, Florida, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, and Utah. All but Alabama are still active. During the 1990s, Braverman owned and directed a clinic called Princeton Associates for Total Health. In 1998, after having been disciplined (as described below) by the New Jersey Medical Board, Braverman worked briefly with Dr. Robert Atkins and then opened PATH Medical in New York City [5].\n\nAt various times during the past few years, in addition to Braverman, PATH\'s Web site has listed eight medical doctors, one osteopath, one chiropractor, two physician assistants, one acupuncturist, and a \"Ph.D.\" nutritionist. The nutritionist, John Pillepich, Ph.D., has a bachelor\'s degree in health sciences from The College at Rockport, a master\'s degree in nutritional sciences from the University of Washington, and a \"Ph.D. in holistic nutrition\" from Clayton College of Natural Medicine [6]. The first two schools are accredited, but Clayton was a nonaccredited correspondence school that shut down several years ago because it could not meet state licensing standards [7]. A former director of product development at the Brain Bio Center, Pillepich worked part-time for Braverman from 2004 through 2014, during part of which he was designated as \"chief science advisor\" for Total Health Nutrients. He also operates SupraHealth, which markets dietary supplements and provides \"customized healing programs\" to people who e-mail their concerns and questions related to 18 categories of health problems listed on the SupraHealth site [8].\n\nThe claims made by Braverman and his clinic are not modest. In a PATH Medical infomercial posted to YouTube:\n\nIn an article titled \"Treat Your Brain Well . . . and It Will Treat You To A Longer and Better Life,\" PATH Medical\'s Web site states:\n\nPATH Medical\'s Web site also has free a \"Brain Deficiency Quiz\" claimed to relate common symptoms to neurotransmitter deficiencies, which it states can be corrected with supplements [11]. I do not believe this test is valid.\n\nProof that Braverman\'s treatment strategies are effective against this enormous number of diseases would require hundreds (possibly thousands) of well-designed clinical trials in which patients who receive a treatment regimen are compared to patients who do not. In February 2017, I searched the U.S. National Library of Medicine PubMed database for \"Braverman, E\" and found his name as author or co-author of about 90 publications in medical journals. However, except for one article about substance abuse, there were no outcome studies of his \"natural treatment approaches.\" His 2017 CV includes about 100 more publications that appeared in lesser journals or were presented as abstracts at meetings. Only a few of these involved nutrient supplementation. Thus I see no published evidence that he has done even a tiny fraction of the studies that would be needed to substantiated his sweeping claims for BEAM testing and its associated treatment.\n\nThere is good reason to believe that patients who seek services at PATH Medical are encouraged to undergo expensive tests that the scientific community would consider unnecessary. On \"Larry King Live,\" Braverman has said that the clinic did \"a brain health assessment on virtually everybody, because your brain health, your mind, your concentration, your memory, your brain\'s speed, your personality, your temperament, all impact your entire well being, and the course of every disease and the course of having a healthier life. . . When you treat the brain, you\'re impacting every illness in your entire life. But what\'s different about us is that we do a head-to-toe computerized exam. Every doctor in America knows that a head-to-toe physical is the way you make observations about health. But today, the computer can actually make a better examination than a manual physician.\" [12]\n\nPATH Medical describes its Executive Health Program (EHP) as a \"comprehensive head-to-toe examination in one day.\" Its components are said to include brain health assessments (including BEAM testing, which costs about $2,000), head-to-toe ultrasounds, a neuromuscular-skeletal review, and tests of more than 250 \"medical and aging markers.\" [13] A few of these, such as blood lipid levels, are standard screening tests, but the vast majority have not been proven cost-effective. Ultrasound testing is an example. There are many situations where ultrasound can help doctors evaluate the structure or function of parts of the body in patients who are having symptoms. But the odds of finding something significant are much too small to justify its use in patients who have no symptoms. The cost of the Executive Health Program depends on the number of tests ordered. Six \"levels are available: the \" Silver Program,\" the \"Silver Program ($10,000), the Platinum Program,\" the \"Rose Diamond Program ($50,000), the \"Diamond Program\" ($75,000), and the \"Elite Program\" ($100,000).\n\nBraverman has been using and promoting BEAM testing for more than 25 years. In his February 1990 Total Health magazine column, he described it as \"the most exciting neurobiological research tool ever developed\" and that it \"symbolizes God\'s intervention in our world through science. . . . just one more dimension of technology that will be part of the age when Christ comes.\" [14] Shortly afterward, in the Journal of Orthomolecular Medicine, he stated:\n\nIn a 1991 issue of Total Health News (a one-page report published by the magazine), an article about Braverman and BEAM claimed that he had successfully treated \"hundreds of seemingly incurable or untreatable cases.\" [16] In a 2011 Huffington Post arrticle, he said:\n\nBEAM testingmore commonly referred to as qEEG (quantitative EEG)is a method of analyzing the electrical activity of the brain to measure and display patterns that may correspond to diagnostic information and/or cognitive deficits. It has a few medically accepted uses (most notably in some cases of epilepsy), but Braverman\'s use goes far beyond what has been proven or even suggested by mainstream researchers. In 1997, the American Academy of Neurology and the American Clinical Neurophysiology Society noted that \"qEEG techiques are very predisposed to false-positive errors\" and concluded that qEEG should be considered investigational for clinical use in post-concussion syndrome, mild-to-moderate head injury, learning disability, attention disorders, schizophrenia, depression, alcoholism, and drug abuse [18]. Aetna, which periodically reviews the status of qEEG, now says:\n\nIn July 1996, following a hearing, the New Jersey Board of Medical Examiners temporarily suspended the license of Eric Braverman, M.D. and ordered him to stop seeing patients. The temporary suspension order included the following allegations:\n\nA petition from the Pennsylvania Medical Board, which reviewed what New Jersey was doing, indicates that a consultant who had evaluated the patient charts for the New Jersey Board had concluded that in 10 of the 11 cases, Braverman had administered or ordered diagnostic testing without indicationwhich \"represented a significant deviation from the normal practice of medicine and allowed Braverman to charge exorbitant fees to his patients.\" [21]\n\nBraverman had broadcast a weekly radio program on station WOR, sponsored by his own vitamin company. WOR canceled the program when the charges became public [22].\n\nIn May 1997, the charges were settled with a consent order under which (a) Braverman was reprimanded for inadequate record keeping and incompletely examining a patient\'s wrist, (b) the remaining charges were withdrawn, (c) the suspension was lifted, and (d) Braverman agreed to pay $20,000 for costs, complete two specified continuing medical education courses, and have patients\' charts monitored by another physician for one year [23].\n\nIn September 2013, the New York Attorney General asked the New York State Supreme Court to order PATH Medical to provide copies of various documents. The petition stated that more than 20 patients had complained to the Attorney General\'s Office (OAG) office about PATH\'s marketing and billing practices [24]. The judge ordered Braverman to cooperate with the investigation. I don\'t know whether he did, but in January 2015, the Attorney General issued a press release that summed up the problems and announced that Braverman had agreed to modify his practices [25]. The press release stated:\n\nAs part of its focus on early detection and treatment of disease, PATH Medical conducted extensive and expensive diagnostic tests during a patient\'s initial visit. Those tests include echocardiograms, costing $1,900, \"brain electrical activity mapping\" tests, for $2,000 collectively, multiple ultrasounds, ranging from $450 to $750, as well as psychological and cognitive assessments. PATH also sold packages of tests and services to patients that ranged in cost from $10,000 to $100,000. While the business, does not participate (i.e., is not \"in-network\") in any health insurance plans, it led some consumers to believe that a significant percentage of the chargessometimes up to 80%would be covered by their health plans\' out-of-network benefit. However, patients\' health plans were not typically covering a significant percentage of the total charges for PATH Medical\'s services. Indeed, some plans were routinely denying the claims submitted by the practice. These alleged inaccurate representations by PATH Medical resulted in some patients facing thousands of dollars in unexpected costs for a single visit.. . . The complainants included one consumer who said she was told by PATH Medical\'s billing representative that the recommended testing for her first visit would cost approximately $8,000. When she expressed concerns about the cost, she was advised that her insurance would cover 80 percent, and she would receive a 50 percent discount. Based on that, the consumer reported paying approximately $4,000, and believed a portion of that would be reimbursed by her health insurance. Her health plan ultimately denied her submitted claims and PATH then advised her she was responsible for the full $8,000. The Attorney General\'s investigation into PATH Medical revealed that the practice did not routinely provide patients with any documentation reflecting what tests and services were purchased, the charges for those tests and services, and what discounts were applied. Some patients also expressed difficulty and frustration with obtaining the results of their extensive testing, and patients sometimes incurred unexpected charges for discussing the results of that testing. The settlement requires PATH Medical to reform its practices to ensure patients are provided with accurate information about their financial responsibility before they agree to undergo any testing or other services. . . .\n\nUnder the agreement [26], PATH Medical must:\n\nThe Better Business Bureau has given an \"F\" rating to PATH Medical because it failed to respond to four complaints made in 2012 or 2013 about its financial practices [27]. Three of the complaints stated that PATH Medical had failed to refund payments made in advance for services that had been canceled or otherwise not received [28]. The RateMD site has reviews from many people who were highly dissatisfied with their experience at his office.\n\nIn 2013, Olga Gilmartin, a former patient, sued Braverman and PATH Medical on grounds that included fraudulent inducement and/or concealment; breach of contract; and unjust enrichment. The complaint alleges that she was misled and improperly pressured into spending approximately $40,000 for tests and treatments that were inappropriate and produced no benefit, and that a hormone medication for which she paid $10,000 was not received [29].\n\nIn 2014, New York comedian Ari Teman filed suit against Braverman, several associates, and PATH Medical. The complaint for includes allegations that the defendants (a) diagnosed and treated him for nonexistent aluminum toxicity, (b) improperly diagnosed and mental conditions for which he prescribed tranquilizers with severe side effects, and (c) deliberately withheld the results of a test that showed that Teman suffered from sleep apnea [30].\n\nPress reports indicate that in 2011, Braverman and his third wife, Darya, began an extremely contentious battle over their divorce and custody of their three children. In 2014, a New York County Supreme Court judge awarded full custody of their children to Darya. In 2016, the court\'s Appellate Division upheld the lower court decision with a ruling that concluded:\n\nIn January 2015, the New York Post reported that (a) Braverman and his attorney Diana Moyhi were arrested for allegedly trying to steal confidential custody-case documents from a courtroom, (b) they were charged with tampering with public records and criminal contempt for disobeying a judge\'s orders not to remove paperwork that was related to the custory battle, and (c) the wife is claiming that their boys are not safe with him because he has tried to improperly medicate them [32]. In December 2015, he was tried before a judge who found him guilty of attempted petty larceny (a misdemeanor) and sentenced him to 15 days in jail plus a $175 fine.\n\nIn 2016, the New York Post reported that Braverman had been arrested again and charged with one count of felony sex abuse. The report stated that a criminal complaint had been issued after a woman had accused him of molesting her in his apartment in 2015 [33].','2017-03-25 03:51:14'),(578,75,'a40758870e158e0583ceb93d083d6371e314a9cb544979ba613a05c67b8b07ac','02c0f194ac8f48be891a2c7d559926de','','','Eric Braverman announced he has been hired to join a new foundation and is not missing.','2017-03-25 03:51:14'),(579,75,'a40758870e158e0583ceb93d083d6371e314a9cb544979ba613a05c67b8b07ac','5788029c40a04f17b2949a57192891a0','','','UPDATE: January 10, 2017  The question remains, whereis Eric Braverman?As I covered 11 days ago, below, no one has been able to get in contact with the former Clinton Foundation CEO since October 22nd. Thats when Wikileaks released an email in which John Podesta named himas a possible mole within the Clinton Foundation. The mainstream media continues to ignore the story.\n\nAnd is he really missing? I just spoke with his father, Stanley Braverman, who told me,Its nonsense, maam, its not true, before hanging up on me. Notehow easy it would be for his dad to disprove it. Instead, he just denied it and hung up.\n\nSnopes reports, New Haven, New York City and Washington D.C. police have no record of a missing person with his name, nor is Braverman listed on NamUs, a national database of missing persons maintained by the Justice Department.\n\nEmails from The Stream toBraverman, Yale University, where he teaches one course, the FBI, and hishusband Neil Brown receivedno substantive response.The Free Thought Projecthad no luck getting information from the university.\n\nBraverman had been hired by Chelsea Clinton to clean up corruption within the foundation, but was forced out by longtime Clinton insiders. The right-wing blogosphere has speculated that the FBI has him in protective FBI custody to protect him from the Clintons or that hes lying low at the Clintons request, in order to avoid being subpoenaed to testify against the organization. Others speculate that he hassought asylum inthe Russian embassy.\n\nWhile the rightwing blogosphere is boiling over with theories, the mainstream media isntcovering the story. CNN is running around the clock coverage of the congressional investigation into Russia allegedly hacking into Podestas emails and the DNCs emails, but has not mentionedthe possibility Braverman might have leaked Podestas emails to Wikileaks.\n\nWikileaks founder Julian Assange said a disgruntled Democratic insider gave him the emails, not the Russians.\n\nBraverman isnt the only one at the Clinton Foundation who Podesta thought could be a mole. In anemail exchangewith an ally, Podesta said, could be doug or ira, referring to Doug Bales and Ira Magaziner.\n\nSince my previous article came out, the only mention of Bravermans disappearance by the mainstream media has been Politicosderisive reference to the story as fake news. At least Snopes revised their entry on the story, changing the status from fake to unknown, with a link to my article.\n\nThe date to watch is Thursday, January 19th.Thats theYale class Braverman teaches,Innovation in Government and Society, begins.Well knowwhether he is missing or not depending on whether he shows up to teach. But dont expect to see a New York Times journalist there. Theyre too busy covering the congressional hearings aboutthe claim that the Russians hacked the emails and gave them to Wikileaks.\n\nDecember 29, 2016  Eric Braverman, the Clinton Foundation CEO from 2013 until 2015, has apparently been missing since October. His absence has fueled speculations in the blogosphere but so far has been ignored by the media.\n\nSome speculate, with good reason, thatBraverman may have gone into hiding after an email mentioning his name was released by Wikileaks on October 22 of this year. In the March2015email exchange,Center for American Progress President Neera Tanden told Clinton campaign manager and confidant JohnPodesta there was a mole within the Clinton Foundation. Podesta in his reply told Tanden the molewas Braverman.\n\nBraverman had abruptly resigned from the Clinton Foundation shortly before this email exchange took place.And then, afterthe email exchange was made public by Wikileaks, Braverman vanishedfrom the public eye.\n\nThis seems like a story that someone might want to report.\n\nThe last evidence of Bravermans public activity wasOctober 12, when he posted his last tweeton Twitter. (Usually he tweets about once a month. His husband, Neil Brown,hasnt tweeted since August, although he rarely tweets.) I left a voicemail on Bravermans personal phone and sent him an email, but received no response.He is still listed asa lecturerat Yale University and, contrary to some reports, there is a recordof his lectures going back several years. I contacted the press office and Bravermans department at Yale and received no response.\n\nCraig Murray, a former British ambassador to Uzbekistan and a close associate of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, toldThe Daily Mail that Podestasemails were leaked to the organization by a disgruntled insider, not the Russians. Consequently, there are suspicions it may have been Braverman. (Though some of the Podesta emails are dated after Bravermans tenure with the foundation, if he had Podestas password, he could still have accessed his email after leaving.)\n\nPolitico ran a long story about Bravermansouster in 2015. Based on email correspondence released by Wikileaks, Bravermanwas apparentlyhired by Chelsea Clinton to clean up the corruption in the foundation, but then forced out of the foundation by longtime Clinton loyalists; sources say Podesta made him a target.\n\nIn 2011, Podestas leaked emails show that Chelseawas aggressively calling for an internal investigation. For example, former President Bill Clinton had raised over $1 billion though the foundation to rebuild 100 villages in India, but only $53 million was spent on the project. Also, Braverman resigned at the time Hillary was arranging one of her notorious pay to play deals with foreign leaders: a $12 million contribution from the king of Morocco in exchange for giving a speech.\n\nSo far Bravermans apparent disappearancehas only been discussed by bloggers and fringe websites, which often mix the fact that he has gone silent with other unconfirmed claims. For instance, the siteWhatDoesItMean.com reportedthat Braverman requested asylum in Russia on October 23.The information apparently came from a Russian blogger, who reported it in a rambling blog post on LiveLeak.\n\nThats pretty thin evidence. Moreover, WhatDoesItMean.comis known for posting questionable news stories. The left-leaning, myth-debunking site Snopes labeled the news sitesaccount of Braverman as false, but based its judgment on the fact that websitepublishes false stories.Aside from this circular argument,Snopes provides no independent evidencefor its judgment. I contactedthe Russian embassy and received no response.So at the moment, the claim that Braverman requested asylum fromthe Russiansis an unconfirmed rumor.\n\nThere are alsorumors that Braverman isin FBI protective custody, perhaps in exchange for testifying against the Clintons. Sources within the FBI have saidit is likely there willbe indictments handed down over the Clinton Foundations pay-to-play schemes. Senior FBI officials told CNN thatthe investigation into the Clinton Foundation had never ended and is still ongoing. According to The Daily Caller News Foundation, that probe now involves as many as five FBI bureaus across the country: New York, Little Rock, Washington, D.C., Los Angeles and Miami.\n\nWould the FBI have hustled Braverman to safety once it was known Podesta had pegged him as a mole? This theoryseems plausible, given what we know. But there is still no independent evidence of it.\n\nIf Braverman is in hiding to protect his life, is it because he leaked the Podesta emails to Wikileaks, and/or is he preparing to testify against the Clintons? The one thing we know is that Braverman has disappeared from the public eye, and that neither he, his husband NeilBrown, nor his family, nor his Yale employers, has made a singlepublic statement to dispel the speculations.\n\nThe hashtag #WheresEric has been started on Twitter.

Requests for the granting of political asylum in the Federation, this report explains, is regulated by a separate government resolution rather than the Law on Refugees and is issued to those seeking asylum or protection from persecution or a real threat of becoming a victim of persecution in their home country for social-political activities or convictions that do not contradict the democratic principles recognized by the international community and norms of international lawand though Russia has the worlds highest number of asylum applications, political asylum requests are very rarely granted. In his apparent knowing of these facts, however, this report continues, Eric Braverman, yesterday (23 October), arrived at the Consulate of Russia in New York City and presented his urgent and immediate request for asylum on a visa applicationas is protocol/custom because the Federation does not accept mail or electronic visa applications from residents of the continental United States.\n\nIt wasnt long before the claim filtered up through conspiracy theory-oriented message boards to open social media and fringe web sites, with many repeating the implausible claim verbatim. But the rumorspurportedly shocking details originated with (and were reported by no source other than) the fake news site WhatDoesItMean.com, described by RationalWiki thusly:\n\nSorcha Faal is the alleged author of an ongoing series of reports published at WhatDoesItMean.com, whose work is of such quality that even other conspiracy nutters dont think much of it.

Braverman is now a member of the board of each active philanthropic entity, including The Schmidt Ocean Institute and The 11th Hour Project.\n\nRumors regarding Bravermans whereabouts began swirling after a leaked document published via WikiLeaks showed his name mentioned in e-mails between Clinton staffers who believed he was furtively releasing information about the foundations financial doings.

The Mirror Online contacted Durex (\"u up?\"), which clarified that this is part of a campaign to call on the Unicode Consortiumto make a safe sex emoji.\n\nLast year, you see, Durex commissioned global research that found that 80 percent of 18 to 25 year olds \"find it easier to express themselves using emojis and more than half of respondents regularly using emojis when discussing sex,\" and that 84 percent of the same demographic \"said they feel more comfortable talking about sex using emojis.\" Durex then called for the creation of safe sex emojis.

One of the course requirements is that each student must do an 18-minute TED-style talk. Its a good exercise in learning to give public talks, as well as organize your thoughts in a manner conducive to both critical thinking and clear communication. The first student TED talk was by Taryn Honeysett on something called The Mandela Effect, of which I was unfamiliar. The name comes from the mistaken belief that the great statesman and civil rights activist Nelson Mandela (19182013) died while in prison in the 1980s, and it is characterized by a group of people who all misremember something in a similar manner.\n\nThe effect gained a cultural toehold in an Internet forum discussion over the proper spelling of a popular childrens book and television series called The Berenstain Bears, when a number of people insisted the correct spelling was Berenstein. (The series began in 1962,with the first book edited and published by Dr. Seussaka Ted Seuss Geisel.)Other examples of The Mandela Effect involve the number of states in the United States (50 or 52, with a sizable number of people believing it is 52, probably mixing states in the U.S. with cards in a deck), the correct spelling of the word definitely (or definitly), and peoples recall of what Darth Vader said in Star Wars: Luke, Im your father or No, Im your father (its the latter, although I too remember it by the more effecting version that addresses the subject).\n\nSo what? So plenty, say some who believe in the Many-Worlds interpretation of quantum physics (first proffered by Hugh Everett and Bryce DeWitt) that allows for parallel universes. In this interpretation, whenever a quantum event occurs the universe splits into parallel universes and timelines. These little glitches, believers in The Mandela Effect say, are signs of other universes and timelines coming into contact with ours. According to a paranormal consultant named Fiona Broome, for example, our universe is just one of an infinite number of universes, each event in each one of which is on its own timeline. If these universes are truly parallel then these timelines cannot come into contact with one another, but if they are not parallel then they might occasionally interact. Evidence for such connections may be found in these common (mis)memories.\n\nIn our universe, for example, Nelson Mandela died in 2013, but people who believe he died in prison in the 1980s are not misremembering Mandels actual death but instead are accurately reporting what really happened in a universe in which Mandela did die in prison. Likewise, in another universe there was a popular childrens book and television series called The Berenstein Bears (although this would mean that the authorsStan and Jan Berenstainalso had a different last name spelling), the United States consists of 52 states (Puerto Rico and Cuba?), and Star Wars includes the line Luke, Im your father. (I wonder if, in one of these other universes, the prequel films were not as awful as they were in our universe?) Oh, and in some universes imaginary numbers are real. Cool.\n\nAlready a good skeptic only three weeks into the semester, my student Taryn Honeysett offered a more rational and reasonable explanation for why people believe in The Mandela Effect: false memories, memory confabulation, social reinforcement of beliefs, the need to effect the world and control our lives, and the desire to believe that we are connected to something greater than ourselves (and what could feel grander than believing you are in contact with an entire parallel universe?!). We know from decades of research by cognitive psychologists that human memory is deeply flawed, constantly edited, and resembles not at all an audio/video recording device that can play back an event on the screen of our minds that is then accurately reported by a homunculus watching the scene replayed. None of us likes to believe that a memory we are confident is accurate is, in fact, completely wrong.\n\nFiona Broome, for example, says she remembers Nelson Mandelas 1980s death clearly, complete with news clips of his funeral, the mourning in South Africa, some rioting in cities, and the heartfelt speech by his widow. Then, I found out he was still alive. At first she thought Oh, I must have misunderstood something on the news, but then at a DragonCon event she heard that others had the same memory as she had about Mandelas death, and from there she began to construct a parallel universes explanation. (All the more reason why we need Skepticality host Derek Colandunos SkepTrack programming at DragonCon!) These arent simple errors in memory, Broome concluded. They seem to be full-constructed incidents (or sequential events) from the past. They exceed the normal range of forgetfulness. Unfortunately Broome does not tell us what she (or cognitive scientists) think is the normal range of memory, but from this premise she asserts that the fact that other people seem to have identical memories is evidence of parallel realities, quantum science, real-life Sliders experiences, and alternate history.\n\nThe Many Worlds interpretation of quantum physics is a legitimate theory, even if it is unproven and probably unprovable. But taking such a theory and grafting it onto something as mundane as memory confabulation and the human desire for transcendence and inter-connectedness becomes a fine example of how science slides into pseudoscience, and why we need skepticism grounded in solid cognitive science of how the mind works.','2017-03-25 03:51:14'),(593,77,'b1976fa56518df560089bf03156d37495d53253a23c22d77c39ae39bd2f491df','dbeb20c030c84a8889e04593fd83b668','','','World icon and former South African president Nelson Mandela joins the company of many other celebrities in the latest Twitter rage: Hoax deaths.\n\nOver the weekend news that Nelson Mandela, along with popstar Justin Bieber, had died spread virally across Twitter.

But following that tragic event, Twitter celebrity death hoaxes have become a favourite sport of a few twisted minds. Similar hoaxes on the social network have targeted singer Aretha Franklin and actors Charlie Sheen, Johnny Depp and Morgan Freeman (who played Nelson Mandela in Invictus).\n\nMandela is increasingly frail and has not appeared publicly since the closing ceremony of the 2010 FIFA World Cup in Johannesburg, so the tragic news of the icons death would at first seem plausible. When the news broke on Twitter, which was trending internationally with the hashtag #RIP Nelson Mandela, the Nelson Mandela Foundation moved quickly to quash the rumours.\n\nNelson Mandela is well and on holiday, said a spokesperson for the Nelson Mandela Foundation, Sello Hatang, said in a statement late Saturday, denying unsubstantiated reports about Nelson Mandelas health.\n\nThe Rapport newspaper also reported that Mandela was alive, but went on to add that the former South African presidents health had declined rapidly.\n\nOn Sunday, Twitter users reacted with outrage and indignation to the hoax.\n\nNelson Mandela didnt die!!

Its not uncommon for media to prepare obituaries and special reports of major world figures long before their actual death  although rather uncommon to mistakenly release these in public. In 2007, US President George W Bush alluded to the former South African leaders death in an embarrassing gaffe while explaining sectarian violence in Iraq.\n\nThe African National Congress (ANC) typically reacted strongly to news of the hoax, reports The Times. The ANC seemed unaware that this latest hoax was just one of many happening on Twitter to celebrities around the world on a daily basis.\n\nThe ANC strongly condemns individuals or groupings behind such a hoax, which is meant to create an atmosphere of panic and anxiety in the country, ANC spokesperson Jackson Mthembu said in a statement.\n\nHe said the hoax was not only malicious but insensitive to the Madiba family and the South African nation.\n\nIt also goes against the African culture and tradition to claim that a living person is dead, Mthembu said.\n\nHe called on Twitter to investigate and find a way of stamping out the public misuse of its platform.\n\nThose behind this hoax are certainly people without any interest in the political and economic stability of South Africa, which we very much owe to the immense contribution by comrade Nelson Mandela, the countrys first democratically elected President, Mthembu said.\n\nTwitters reputation as a source for breaking news and information is unlikely to be tarnished by this or any other of the multitude of hoaxes that take place on the platform on a daily basis.

The picture tweeted on Dec. 5, 2013 had been taken on June 29, 2013, when Barack and Michelle Obama visited the world famous site.\n\nAs president and first lady of the USA, the Obamas make pretty good vultures.\n\nThis is the story of Mandelas June 26 death following his persistent vegetative state as reported by theGuardian Express:\n\nOn the morning ofJune 26, we received a message from one of our South African correspondents, Laura Oneale that Nelson Mandela had passed away the previous evening. The news had come to her in the form of a text message from an acquaintance who was well-placed in the South African media. It should be understood that this organization was not authorized to break the news. Clearly, the South African government and the Mandela family had already decided that the news would not be made public. Undoubtedly, this decision had been made even before his death; at least, thats what we were thinking.\n\nOur assumption,at the time, was two-fold: firstly, we doubted that such news would not long escape the attention of the international media, even if the South African media was being muzzled. As is the nature of the news media industry, we saw that we had been handed a major scoop and that our window of opportunity to be the first to break this news was limited. Cynical? Perhaps, but we did not doubt the integrity of the source, given that individuals position. We are in the news business. What other publication  given the gravity of the story and the knowledge of Mandelas health condition  would not have immediately prepared to publish? We began both to work on a couple of articles and to seek out verification. We found no other corroborating evidence. We wrote our stories.\n\nIn the interests of being completely honest, we cannot say that we did not second  guess ourselves. Did we have direct, first-hand proof that Nelson Mandela was dead? No, we didnt. One must look at how news stories are broken, though: A media publication receives information from a trusted source; every good faith attempt is made to verify the information. In the absence of verification, the editor or editorial team must make a decision to publish or not to publish. What we did have was the best source we could have, other than first-hand, eye-witness testimony. Moreover, Mandela was seriously ill; according to reports, the icon and former African leader was on his deathbed; hooked up to medical devices that enabled him to breathe.\n\nNow, we were walking on eggshells; our reputation was at stake. What were we thinking? Other news outlets actually published stories announcing Mandelas death; they quickly retracted, without actually justifying why they had done so. To us, that in itself indicated that they had been told to retract, rather than doing so because they had discovered that Mandela was still alive. The Las Vegas Guardian Express, however, was a relatively new and completely independent publication with no government ties and no corporate owners or shareholders. We could not be pressured into retracting, other than through legal action. In addition, we were a tiny speck on the world news radar.\n\nNaturally, it was in our own interests to quickly verify Mandelas condition. Is that an admission that we published news of his death without being sure? No, it is not; we were sure and we could clearly see that an official announcement could be kept under wraps for any number of reasons; a visit by US President Barack Obama was already scheduled and there were obvious security implications. Additionally, the South African government is absolutely capable of using such news for political purposes. Our only misgiving was that we had failed to uncover any corroborating source. The strength of our conviction is proven by the fact that, even as the days went by and no word of his death came from official or family sources, we maintained our position. It seemed logical enough that there was no reason to retract without absolute proof that Nelson Mandela still lived.\n\nAs the few articles we published drew attention  along with numerous comments  it became self-evident that both the South African government and the Mandela family were aware of our reports. Had we been wrong  and had the family been able to prove that Mandela was still alive  it is beyond doubt that the Las Vegas Guardian Express would have received some form of legal threat. Not only did such action never transpire, but our publication was subjected to cyber-attack: Denial of Service attacks, originating in South Africa, disabled our site on more than one occasion. We took this as proof that we were reporting something that the South African government did not want us to report.\n\nIt should be remembered that our publication was relatively small and generated only modest revenue through advertising. Nevertheless  and at considerable expense  we dispatched a senior editor to South Africa. During his time there, Michael Smith uncovered intriguing details of the situation regarding Nelson Mandela, the family, the African National Congress and South African President Jacob Zuma. Our investigations opened a door into the corruption and dishonesty of the aforementioned parties. During a Mandela family legal battle, documents emerged which stated that doctors had advised the family to turn off Mandelas life support as he was brain-dead. At a later point, Zuma made a statement denying this, but we noted carefully that, while other news organizations were reporting that the doctors themselves had retracted their claims that Mandela was brain-dead, no such retraction had been made; Zuma himself claimed that the doctors had retracted this assertion.\n\nNow that it has been officially announced that Nelson Mandela has passed away, our position on the matter has not changed in any way. Inevitably, his passing had to be revealed. Many of our South African readers have believed us from the start; those that have criticized us have presented not one shred of evidence that we were wrong. The idea that we are proven wrong because the official announcement comes only now is absurd.\n\nThis article has not detailed every piece of evidence that fell into place during our investigation into why Nelson Mandelas death was covered up. One of the most compelling discoveries was brought back from South Africa by Michael Smith: He returned with an audio tape of a recorded telephone conversation Between a South African Defense Force officer and a private security contractor. The audio can be found in the first of the links listed at the foot of this article. For the reader who wishes to get the full story of our reporting on this story, each of those articles listed provide, collectively, the complete picture. During the call, the officer details the circumstances of Mandelas death  which, according to him, occurred even earlier than we reported  and the possible implications of it, as well as the Mandela familys motives for not releasing the news.\n\nEven now, the South African government, it seems, is attempting to prevent the Las Vegas Guardian Express from revealing the truth to the people of South Africa. Our Facebook page received a telling comment today. The comment reads:\n\nHalloI am from South Africa and for some reason I cannot view your website or any articles regarding Nelson Mandela.

A state funeral was held on 15 December 2013 in Qunu in the Eastern Cape province, where his body was buried.\n\nPresident Jacob Zuma announced Mandela\'s death on national television on 6 December 2013 at 23:45 local time (UTC+2).[4][5]\n\nThe South African government announced a period of 10 days of national mourning ending with the state funeral on 15 December 2013.[6] Zuma ordered that all flags on government buildings be flown at half-mast for the duration of this period.[7]\n\nOn 9 December the government confirmed that at least 80 foreign heads of state and government would travel to South Africa to attend events.[6] African heads of state confirmed to be attending include the Prime Minister of Lesotho, the President of Mozambique, the President of Namibia, the President of Niger, the President of Nigeria, the Prime Minister of Swaziland, the President of Tanzania, the President of Tunisia, the President of Uganda, the President of Zimbabwe, and the President of Zambia. Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma attended in her capacity as Chairperson of the African Union Commission.[6]\n\nOther notable guests include the President of the United States and three former presidents of the United States; the President of India; the Prime Minister of Italy; the Vice President of China; the President of Brazil; the President of France; the President of Ireland; the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom; the President of Germany; the Prime Minister of Australia; two former Governors General of Canada, the Prime Minister of Canada, and four former Prime Ministers of Canada; the Prime Minister of Jamaica; the Prime Minister of Jordan; and the President of Afghanistan. Royal dignitaries attending include, the King of the Netherlands, the King of Belgium, the Prince of Wales, the Prince of Asturias, the Crown Prince of Denmark, the Crown Princess of Sweden, the Crown Prince of Norway, the Crown Prince of Japan, and the Queen Rania of Jordan.[6]\n\nThe South African government declared Sunday, 8 December 2013 to be observed as a national day of prayer and reflection.[6]\n\nThe official memorial service was held at FNB Stadium in Johannesburg on Tuesday, 10 December 2013 commencing at 11:00 local time (UTC+2).[8][9] 91 heads of state and government; and 10 retired presidents were expected to attend this service.[10][11]\n\nIn what was characterised as a national embarrassment, during the memorial service it became evident that the official sign language interpreter, Thamsanqa Jantjie, was a fake.[12] DeafSA, a South African association for the deaf, stated that Jantjie had made a \"mockery of South African sign language\" and that the \"deaf community was in outrage\".[13] Jantjie, who stood on the memorial stage alongside world leaders throughout the event, made meaningless hand gestures that did not reflect established signs. How Jantjie had obtained the job and received security clearance raised questions about bureaucratic mismanagement.[13]\n\nOn 12 December, Jantjie apologised if he had offended anyone, explaining that his performance was impaired due to a hallucination brought on by his schizophrenia. He added that he suffers from violent tendencies and stated that he had been hospitalised in a mental health facility for 19 months, beginning around 2006. Nonetheless, he maintained that he performed well, calling himself \"a champion of sign language\".[14][15]\n\nThe same day, Deputy Minister for Women, Children and People with Disabilities Hendrietta Bogopane-Zulu admitted, \"In the process, and in the speed of the event, a mistake happened.\" However, she rejected the view that Jantjie was a fraud, stating, \"we should not say that he is a fake interpreter because he does have a basic sign language translation qualification. He started off very well and got tired in the process ... [H]e has interpreted to deaf people in court before and is able to communicate with his deaf friends very well. It\'s just that (on that day) he did not sign what was expected of him.\"[16] The South African news broadcaster eNCA alleges that between 1994 and 2003 Jantjie was charged, but not sentenced, for various crimes ranging from rape and housebreaking to attempted murder and kidnapping. According to the report he was sentenced to three years in prison for theft but the other charges were dropped as he was judged mentally unfit to stand trial.[12] Another report states that Jantjie was part of a group that found two men with a stolen television, and then burned them to death by setting fire to tires placed around their necks (a practice known as \"necklacing\").[17]\n\nSouth African President Jacob Zuma was unexpectedly booed and jeered by some in the crowd, though other sections cheered him. The booing faded when Zuma addressed the crowd.[18] The negative reaction reportedly stemmed from public anger over corruption scandals that have tainted Zuma and his government. The current ANC leadership is viewed as not living up to Mandela\'s celebrated legacy.[19]\n\nUnited States President Barack Obama shook hands with Cuban leader Raul Castro, the first such encounter between sitting U.S. and Cuban heads of government since Bill Clinton and Fidel Castro shook hands at the U.N. in 2000.[20] The gesture prompted criticism from Republican politicians in Washington. Congresswoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, a Cuban-American opponent of the Castro government, said: \"Sometimes a handshake is just a handshake, but when the leader of the free world shakes the bloody hand of a ruthless dictator like Raul Castro, it becomes a propaganda coup for the tyrant.\" Senator John McCain compared the ObamaCastro handshake to British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain\'s handshake with Adolf Hitler when the two were in the process of negotiating the Munich Agreement in 1938 saying, \"Neville Chamberlain shook hands with Hitler. It gives Raul some propaganda to continue to prop up his dictatorial, brutal regime, that\'s all\".[21] The Cuban government welcomed the gesture, although the White House said it had been unplanned.[22]\n\nAlong with Obama, Helle Thorning-Schmidt and David Cameronthe respective leaders of USA, Denmark and the UK faced criticism on social media that they had behaved inappropriately after posing for a \"selfie\" which was taken using Thorning-Schmidt\'s mobile phone.[23][24] Defending her actions, Thorning-Schmidt said, \"There were lots of pictures taken that day, and I just thought it was a bit fun. Maybe it also shows that when we meet heads of state and government, we too are just people who have fun.\"[23] Cameron said he was being polite when Thorning-Schmidt asked him to take part in the picture.[25]\n\nMandela\'s body lay in state at the Union Buildings in Pretoria from 11 to 13 December 2013.[8] Approximately 100,000 mourners viewed Mandela\'s body over the three days. The crowds grew larger each day and thousands who queued on the final day could not be accommodated and were turned away.[26][27] Nelson Mandela\'s grandson, Mandla Mandela, remained with his grandfather\'s body for all three days, in accordance with AbaThembu tradition, which requires an adult male family member to remain with the body until burial.[28]\n\nThe state funeral was held on 15 December 2013 in Qunu in the Eastern Cape.[8] The ceremony was held in a very large tent in Qunu erected for the event and attended by 4,500 people, including various heads of state and foreign dignitaries.[29] The ceremony was televised on South African television up until the burial, when the filming and broadcast was stopped at the advance request of the Mandela family.[30] The ceremony was shown on big screens set up in public viewing spaces around the area.[31] The burial part of the funeral programme was attended by 450 selected people, including relatives and chosen dignitaries.[32] Shortly before the burial, Nelson Mandela was given a 21 gun salute and a missing man formation flyover by fighter jets.[32][33][34]\n\nThe Mayor of Cape Town, Patricia de Lille, announced that the city would host an interfaith service on the Grand Parade, which has been designated as Cape Town\'s primary public mourning space, on Sunday, 8 December 2013. A public night vigil was held there on the evening before Mandela\'s funeral. Cape Town also hosted a free tribute concert at the Cape Town Stadium on Wednesday, 11 December 2013.[35]\n\nA memorial service in honour of Mandela was held on 11 December 2013 in Abu Dhabi.[36]\n\nQueen Elizabeth II honoured Mandela with a thanksgiving service at Westminster Abbey in early 2014.[37][38][39][citation needed]\n\nA memorial service in honour of Mandela was held on 11 December 2013 at Washington National Cathedral in Washington, D.C.[40]\n\nThe last will and testament of Mandela was read on 3 February 2014.[195] At the time of the reading, his estate was worth an estimated 46 million Rand.[196] The will was written in 2004 and was last amended in 2008.[197]\n\nIn his will, Mandela left his estate to Machel, family members, staff, schools and the ANC.[197]','2017-03-25 03:51:14'),(596,77,'b1976fa56518df560089bf03156d37495d53253a23c22d77c39ae39bd2f491df','c16f59528170485a859be567bd5b9f28','','','A premature obituary is an obituary published whose subject is not actually deceased at the time of publication. Examples of premature obituaries include that of arms manufacturer Alfred Nobel, whose premature obituary condemning him as a \"merchant of death\" may have caused him to create the Nobel Prize;[1] black nationalist Marcus Garvey, whose actual death was apparently caused by reading his own obituary;[2] and actor Abe Vigoda, who was the subject of so many premature obituaries that a website was created to state whether he was alive or dead.\n\nThis article lists the recipients of incorrect death reports (not just formal obituaries) from publications, media organisations, official bodies, and widely used information sources such as the Internet Movie Database; but not mere rumours of deaths, nor reports from sites which feature automated death hoax stories designed to draw in page clicks from specific web searches. People who were presumed (though not categorically declared) to be dead, and joke death reports that were widely believed, are also included.\n\nPremature obituaries may be published for reasons such as the following:\n\nMultiple premature obituaries came to light on 16 April 2003, when it was discovered that pre-written draft memorials to several world figures were available on the development area of the CNN website without requiring a password (and may have been accessible for some time before).[347] The pages included tributes to Fidel Castro, Dick Cheney, Nelson Mandela, Bob Hope, Gerald Ford, Pope John Paul II, and Ronald Reagan (all of which claim they died in 2001).\n\nSome of these obituaries contained fragments taken from others, particularly from Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother\'s obituary, which had apparently been used as a template. Dick Cheney for example was described as the \'UK\'s favorite grandmother\', the site noted the Pope\'s \'love of racing\', and described Castro as \'lifeguard, athlete, movie star\' (a reference to Ronald Reagan).

The Major Memories page is a good starting point.\n\nNelson Mandela died in prison, long before his loss on December 5th, 2013.\n\nMany people  perhaps thousands  seem to believe that.\n\nThats where the title of this website, The Mandela Effect, came from.\n\nSee, I thought Nelson Mandela died in prison. I thought I remembered it clearly, complete with news clips of his funeral, the mourning in South Africa, some rioting in cities, and the heartfelt speech by his widow.\n\nThen, I found out he was still alive.\n\nMy reaction was sensible, Oh, I must have misunderstood something on the news.\n\nI didnt think about it again for many years, until  in the VIP suite at Dragon*Con  a member of Security (Shadow) casually mentioned that many people remember when Nelson Mandela died in prison.\n\nThat caught my attention in a hurry.\n\nOne thing led to another, and I discovered a large community of people who remember the same Mandela history that I recall.\n\nOthers have similar false memories. One of the most recent and prevalent is the death of Billy Graham. Though some claim that people are confusing that with Mr. Grahams retirement, or perhaps the televised funeral of Mr. Grahams wife, those who clearly remember the events disagree heartily.\n\nHowever, its not just deaths. People have told me about a variety of odd conflicts between their vivid memories and the world theyre currently living in.\n\nDuring Dragon*Con 2010, someone insisted that he remembered a Star Trek episode that  according to one star of the show  was never filmed. The person who remembered the alternate episode wasnt weird or wild-eyed he was a very normal person, and only referenced the episode as part of a routine conversation.\n\nI was there when he heard that the episode never existed. He was stunned, and quickly tried to find a logical explanation for his faulty memory.\n\nAnother quirky false memory involves the preview and pre-release of the sequel to the movie, Avatar.\n\nThese arent simple errors in memory; they seem to be fully-constructed incidents (or sequential events) from the past. They exceed the normal range of forgetfulness.\n\nEven stranger, other people seem to have identical memories.\n\nThis website  and my upcoming book  explore the possibilities of parallel realities, quantum science, real-life Sliders experiences, and alternate history.\n\nIf you believed that Nelson Mandela died in prison  long before his passing (in this timestream) on 5 December 2013  or you have similar memories of a different past, youre not alone.','2017-03-25 03:51:14'),(598,78,'b3ac7ab2322e8640163296226c80e020f560d8eaf2187e7ee34e10cae201c27f','00a1e1a9c8db45a7a7183947438e6fa2','','','Opening day in the U.S. National Football League saw Kansas City cornerback Marcus Peters raise a black-gloved fist during the national anthem, a protest amplified later Sunday when four Miami Dolphins kneeled on the sideline with hands on their hearts as The Star Spangled Banner played in Seattle.\n\nThe protests were inspired by San Francisco backup quarterback Colin Kaepernick, the first NFL player who chose to sit and take a knee during the anthem in preseason games to call attention to what he termed the oppression of blacks and other minorities.\n\nI chose to get involved to see if I could create change, raise awareness. And I want to make it clear that there is no disrespect to the military or to police officers - I\'m not about that. I love everyone, said Miami\'s Jelani Jenkins, one of the Dolphins to kneel. I would like to keep moving forward in the right direction with everybody: equal rights, equal opportunity. From my position, it doesn\'t seem that it\'s happening. That\'s why I took a stand.\n\nThe Dolphins got support from one very important person - their boss, team owner Stephen Ross.\n\nI don\'t think it was any lack of respect, Ross said. I think everybody here, our team and our whole organization, respects the flag and what it stands for, the soldiers and everything. These guys are really making a conversation of something that\'s a very important topic in this country and I\'m 100 percent supportive of them.\n\nPeters\' gesture was the only one visible throughout the early games Sunday, as the anthems took on more significance because of the 15th anniversary of Sept. 11 attacks.\n\nI come from a majority black community from Oakland, California ... so the struggle, I seen it, Peters said after the Chiefs beat San Diego 33-27 in overtime. I still have some family in the struggle. All I\'m saying is we want to educate those, the youth that\'s coming up.\n\nThe four Miami players - Arian Foster, Michael Thomas, Jenkins and Kenny Stills - registered their protest shortly before kickoff. The four players stood while President Barack Obama\'s message played regarding the 15th anniversary of 9/11 before taking a knee . All four stood at the conclusion of the anthem.\n\nIf it\'s about the knee that people are upset about, every Sunday people of faith take a knee to give thanks to their lord and savior, whatever faith or religion that they are, Foster said. It\'s not about a knee, it\'s not about the (symbolism), it\'s about the message. They say it\'s not the time to do this, but when is the time?\n\nSeveral teams, including the Chiefs and Seahawks, saw their players link arms during the anthem. Peters, the 2015 defensive rookie of the year, was the last person in the Chiefs line and had his arm free to raise it.\n\nHe spoke up about something he felt he needed to speak up about, Peters said last week. I salute him for that.\n\nBroncos linebacker Brandon Marshall, a teammate of Kaepernick\'s in college at Nevada, took a knee during the anthem on Thursday night.\n\nNFL commissioner Roger Goodell weighed in on Kaepernick\'s protest last week as well, saying, I don\'t necessarily agree with what he\'s doing.\n\nSeattle\'s locker room was engaged in a lengthy discussion over the past few weeks about what type of message to send. The players enlisted coach Pete Carroll in the discussions almost from the start, and brought Dr. Harry Edwards to help direct the conversations.\n\nGestures mean nothing without follow through. That\'s what Harry Edwards said and that\'s what I agree with, Seattle cornerback Richard Sherman said. People get confused that you have to go out there and put on a show and make this gesture and make people aware of it, and we\'re more about action.\n\nWide receiver Doug Baldwin, who became a default spokesman for Seattle\'s actions, said the players are working to schedule a meeting with the mayor of Seattle and local law enforcement.\n\nWe know that there has to be change and progress, Baldwin said. Change is inevitable. Change will always happen. But you got to apply direction to change, and that\'s when it\'s progress. And so right now what we\'re doing as a team, we have a follow through.\n\nA taped message from Presidents Obama and George W. Bush were played at each stadium. Bush attended the Giants-Cowboys match in Arlington, Texas, while Vice President Joe Biden was in Philadelphia for Browns-Eagles.\n\nPeters\' gesture was also a tribute of sorts to U.S. sprinters Tommie Smith and John Carlos, who won the gold and bronze medals, respectively, in the 200-meter race at the 1968 Olympics. Both then appeared on the medal stands with raised, black-gloved fists throughout the U.S. national anthem in what they called a human rights salute.\n\nAnd in the night game, New England\'s Martellus Bennett and Devin McCourty both held up their right arms. Teammate Danny Amendola was seen clutching the American flag unfurled on the field in Arizona.\n\nThe International Olympic Committee ordered Smith and Carlos expelled from the games because of the protest.','2017-03-25 03:51:14'),(599,78,'b3ac7ab2322e8640163296226c80e020f560d8eaf2187e7ee34e10cae201c27f','5e7b707800a54ffbaa9dfd11eb446abf','','','President Barack Obama showed support for NFL star Colin Kaepernick on Sunday, taking a knee during the National Anthemprior todelivering the keynote address before the Congressional BlackCaucus in Washington. link ][','2017-03-25 03:51:14'),(600,78,'b3ac7ab2322e8640163296226c80e020f560d8eaf2187e7ee34e10cae201c27f','25481162a75949d0b923aa92508a16df','','','Since then, other professional athletes have also chosen not to stand for the national anthem, sparking a national debate.\n\nA member of the audience at the town hall, which was moderated by CNN\'s Jake Tapper, asked what the President thought about Kaepernick\'s protest.\n\n\"Lately, some players in the NFL have been choosing to take a knee during the national anthem, a time which I believe should be reserved to respect our service members,\" the man said. \"As commander in chief, how do you feel about those NFL players choosing this respected time to voice their opinions?\"\n\nObama responded: \"Well, as I\'ve said before, I believe that us honoring our flag and our anthem is part of what binds us together as a nation. But I also always try to remind folks that part of what makes this country special is that we respect people\'s rights to have a different opinion.\" Obama added that he believes protesters should be aware that the reason they are able to share their opinions are because people \"fight\" for them to be able to do so. \"The test of our fidelity to our Constitution, to freedom of speech, to our Bill of Rights, is not when it\'s easy, but when it\'s hard,\" he said. \"We fight sometimes so that people can do things that we disagree with ... As long as they\'re doing it within the law, then we can voice our opinion objecting to it but it\'s also their right.\" The President also continued that it is important for \"everybody to listen to each other.\" \"I want (the protesters) to listen to the pain that that may cause somebody who, for example, had a spouse or a child who was killed in combat and why it hurts them to see somebody not standing,\" Obama said. \"But I also want people to think about the pain he may be expressing about somebody who\'s lost a loved one that they think was unfairly shot.\" Earlier this month, Obama made similar comments about the quarterback, saying he was \"exercising his constitutional right\" by not standing for the national anthem. \"I got to confess that I haven\'t been thinking about football while I\'ve been over here and I haven\'t been follow this closely,\" Obama said September 5 during a news conference at the conclusion of the G20 summit in China . \"But my understanding, at least, is that is he\'s exercising his constitutional right to make a statement.

The protests began in the National Football League (NFL) after San Francisco 49ers quarterback (QB) Colin Kaepernick sat during the anthem, as opposed to the tradition of standing, before his team\'s third preseason game of 2016. Kaepernick also sat during the first two preseason games, but this went unnoticed.[1]\n\nThe protests have generated mixed reactions and have since spread to other U.S. sports leagues.\n\nDuring a post-game interview he explained his position stating, \"I am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color. To me, this is bigger than football and it would be selfish on my part to look the other way. There are bodies in the street and people getting paid leave and getting away with murder\", adding that he would continue to protest during the anthem until he feels like \"[the American flag] represents what its supposed to represent.[2][3][4]\n\nIn the 49ers\' final 2016 preseason game on September 1, 2016, Kaepernick opted to kneel during the U.S. national anthem rather than sit as he did in their previous games. He explained his decision to switch was an attempt to show more respect to former and current U.S. military members while still protesting during the anthem after having a conversation with former NFL player and U.S. military veteran Nate Boyer. Fellow 49ers player Eric Reid joined Kaepernick in kneeling during the national anthem during the final preseason game.[5] Seattle Seahawks player Jeremy Lane also did not stand for the anthem during his final preseason game the same day, stating \"It\'s something I plan to keep on doing until justice is being served.\"[6]\n\nKaepernick pledged to donate the first $1 million of his $11.9 million salary from the 20162017 season to different organizations that help communities in need.[7] He intends to donate $100,000 per month for 10 months to various organizations.[8] Days later, the San Francisco 49ers matched Kaepernick by pledging $1 million to two organizations focused on dealing with racial and social inequality.[9]\n\nIn Week 1, eleven NFL players joined Kapernick\'s protests.[10] Denver Broncos player Brandon Marshall took a knee during the national anthem prior to the start of the Kickoff game, which was broadcast on NBC.[11] Kaepernick and Marshall were teammates at the University of Nevada.[11] On September 11, Kansas City Chiefs player Marcus Peters raised his fist while the rest of the team interlocked their arms showing solidarity.[12] Two members of the New England Patriots, Devin McCourty and Martellus Bennett, raised their fists on Sunday Night Football. The entire Seattle Seahawks team stood and interlocked arms.[13] At the same time, a group of Jacksonville Jaguars players, led by cornerback Prince Amukamara, initially planned to join the protest but chose not to do so after photographs of Kaepernick wearing socks with a crude anti-police message during training camp were made public.[14]\n\nSince then other NFL players have also protested during the anthem in various ways.\n\nSeattle Reign FC and U.S. women\'s national soccer team player Megan Rapinoe knelt during the national anthem in a game on September 5, explaining that her decision was a \"nod to Kaepernick and everything that he\'s standing for right now\".[15] In a subsequent match at the Washington Spirit, Spirit owner Bill Lynch  anticipating Rapinoe\'s protest  moved the national anthem\'s performance without warning or notice to occur before the players\' appearances on the pitch. Jeff Plush, the league\'s commissioner, was present at the game and told reporters that he was unaware of Lynch\'s plans and disagreed with the act of moving the anthem\'s performance.[16] The Spirit\'s players issued a joint statement also disagreeing with Lynch\'s decision to move the anthem without first consulting the team\'s players or coaches.[17]\n\nAs a member of the U.S. women\'s national soccer team, Rapinoe also knelt before an international friendly match against Thailand on September 16, despite public statements of disagreement with her protest methods issued before the match by the U.S. Soccer Federation and her coach Jill Ellis.[18]\n\nOn September 7, three volleyball players from West Virginia Tech took a knee during the national anthem.[19][20] On October 1, 2016, at East Carolina University, about 19 members of the band kneeled, while about another two held the American flag during the national anthem at the beginning of the football game against the University of Central Florida.[21]\n\nOn September 2, a football player at Brunswick High School in Ohio took a knee during the national anthem after he heard his teammates using the n-word.[20] Since his protest, the player has received racial threats.[22] On September 9, high school players across the country took a knee during the national anthem. On September 23, four players from Withrow High School in Cincinnati knelt during the national anthem before their football game.[20]\n\nOn November 13, 2016, following the election of Donald Trump as the President-elect, Mike Evans wide-receiver for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers decided to sit during the national anthem. According to Sports Illustrated, Evans said, \"If this happens, then Americas not right right now. I said this a long time ago. When he ran, I thought it was a joke, and the joke continues. Im not a political person that much, but I got common sense. And I know when somethings not right.\" He especially disagreed with Trump on attitudes towards minorities, women, and the LGBT community.[23] However, his protest began the day following Veterans Day, so he received criticism. He quickly changed his method of protesting and joined his teammates during the following game against the Kansas City Chiefs. He apologized to veterans and other members of the military for his actions - citing that the timing of his protest was poor. \"On the field, I\'m going to continue to do what I do -- play hard. I\'m playing hard because I\'ve got this right -- freedom, because of the vets. I\'m going to reach out to organizations, organizations that I feel are doing the best job to help the minority ... women, LGBT, African Americans, Latinos, people that are in fear of Donald Trump and his presidency.\"[24]\n\nUnited States President Barack Obama stated that Kaepernick was \"exercising his constitutional right\" to protest.[25] He went on: \"But I don\'t doubt his sincerity. I think he cares about some real, legitimate issues that have to be talked about. If nothing else, he\'s generated more conversation about issues that have to be talked about.\"[25]\n\nAfter Brandon Marshall elected to take a knee during the national anthem, Century Link and Air Academy Federal Credit Union dropped him as a paid sponsor.[26] Radio station WFAY dropped a broadcast of an East Carolina University football game on the station after the marching band took part in the protest, calling it an insult to the U.S. Armed Forces.[27]\n\nKaepernick also received public backlash for his protest. A few NFL fans posted videos of them burning Kaepernick jerseys. Former NFL MVP Boomer Esiason called Kaepernick\'s actions \"an embarrassment\" while an anonymous NFL executive called Kaepernick \"a traitor\".[28] He also claims to have received death threats.[29]\n\nTrent Dilfer criticized Kaepernick. \"The big thing that hit me through all this was this is a backup quarterback whose job is to be quiet, and sit in the shadows and get the starter ready to play Week 1,\" Dilfer said on Sunday NFL Countdown. \"Yet he chose a time where all of a sudden he became the center of attention. And it has disrupted that organization. It has caused friction.

One member of the armed services asked a pointed question about the ongoing anthem protests happening during football games.\n\nMr. President, said First Lieutenant James Sutter, we honor those who have given deep meaning to the phrase home of the brave by making the ultimate sacrifice for the land of the free. Lately, some players in the NFL have been choosing to take a knee during the national anthem, a time which I believe should be reserved to respect our service members. As Commander-in-Chief, how do you feel about those NFL players choosing this typically respected time to voice their opinions?\n\nAs Ive said before, I believe that us honoring our flag and our anthem is part of what binds us together as a nation, President Obama said. And I think that for me, for my family, for those who work in the White House, we recognize what it means to us, but also what it means to the men and women who are fighting on our behalf. But Im also always trying to remind folks that part of what makes this country special is that we respect peoples rights to have a different opinion and to make different decisions about how they want to express their concerns. And the test of our fidelity to our Constitution, to freedom of speech, to our Bill of Rights is not when its easy, but when its hard. We fight sometimes so that people can do things that we disagree with, but thats what freedom means in this country.\n\nMy hope would be that as this debate surfaces, were always reminding ourselves that in a democracy like ours, there are gonna be a lot of folks who do stuff that we just dont agree with. But as long as theyre doing it within the law, then we can voice our opinion objecting to it, but its also their right.\n\nAnd I think that its also important for us to recognize that sometimes out of these controversies we start getting into a conversation, and I want everybody to listen to each other. So I want Mr. Kaepernick and others who are on a knee, I want them to listen to the pain that that may cause somebody who for example had a spouse or a child who was killed in combat and why it hurts them to see somebody not standing. But I also want people to think about the pain that he may be expressing about somebody whos lost a loved one that they think was unfairly shot.\n\nAnd one of the things I always say about American democracy is that it can be frustrating but its the best system we got. The only way that we make it work is to see each other, listen to each other, try to be respectful of each other, not just go into separate corners. And I do hope that anybody whos trying to express any political view of any sort understands that they do so under the blanket of protection of our men and women in uniform, and that that appreciation of that sacrifice is never lost.\n\nIt sounds good in theory, but its hardly an accurate reflection of modern political discourse, where middle grounds are never acknowledged, and where so many people have a hardened beliefthat their view is correct and anyone who disagrees with them is stupid, corrupt, and/or un-American.','2017-03-25 03:51:14'),(606,78,'b3ac7ab2322e8640163296226c80e020f560d8eaf2187e7ee34e10cae201c27f','6dcfc885e5644c82a0c95a646b80be26','','','President Barack Obama showed support for NFL star Colin Kaepernick on Sunday, taking a knee during the National Anthemprior todelivering the keynote address before the Congressional BlackCaucus in Washington.\n\nObama, who previously expressed his support for Kaepernicks protest, lowered himself to one knee and crossed his arms Sunday morning, as pop singer Beyonc sang the National Anthem dressed in a Black Panther outfit almost identical to the one she wore controversially at the Super Bowl earlier this year.

The allegation came froma witness who testified the two were romantically linked, according to CNN.\n\nThis witness said El Indio andseveral other known drug-traffickers attended Machadosdaughters baptism in 2008.The witness  who went into protection soon after giving this testimony was shot and killed at a cafe in Mexico City in 2009.Machado has since deniedthese reports, claiming her childs father is a well-respected businessman.\n\nA Venezuelan judge said Machado threatened to ruin my career as a judge and  kill me, after he indicted her then-boyfriend for murder. In 1998, her boyfriend allegedly shot and killed the judgesbrother-in-law outside of the church where his sisters funeral was being held. According to the Associated Press, some said Machado drove the getaway car, but she wasnt charged because there wasnt sufficient evidence, despite the fact no one corroborated her alibi that she was home sick at the time of the shooting.\n\nWhen CNNs Anderson Cooper asked her about these allegations, Machado didnt exactly deny them.\n\nHe can say whatever he wants to say, she said. I dont care. You know, I have my past. Of course, everybody has. Everybody has a past. And Im not a saint girl. But that is not the point now.\n\nIn 2010, Machadode-activated her Twitter account after she called North and South Korea the Chinas.\n\nTonight I want to ask you to join me in a prayer for peace, that these attacks between the Chinas do not make our situation worse, she tweeted.\n\nThe tweet spurred a lot of backlash, prompting her to delete her account.\n\nI now have a lot of psychopaths on the account and its best I start another one, she said before signing off.\n\nShes appeared in Playboyseveral times throughout her career in magazines that hit stands in both Mexico and the United States.\n\nThese details about Machados past raise questions, not just about the Clinton campaign, but the medias eagerness to disseminateHillarys narrative. Why were so many media outlets so quick to take Clintons narrative and run with it without taking a second look at who Alicia Machado is?

The images, posted this week to a newspapers website, are grainy and do not include nudity.\n\nThe show took place almost a decade after Trump invited reporters to watch Machado exercise and mocked her publicly for gaining weight after she won Miss Universe, which Trump owned at the time. In Mondays debate, Mrs Clinton brought up Trumps taunts of Machado.\n\nAfter the Twitter tirade against Machado and Clinton, Trump offered a bizarre defence for the rant.\n\nFor those few people knocking me for tweeting at three oclock in the morning, at least you know I will be there, awake, to answer the call!, he Tweeted, suggesting that his unusual waking hours made him a better candidate for the presidency.\n\nShaming Machado over intimate details from her past was particularly risky as Trump tries to win over more female voters, many of whom are turned off by such personal attacks. It also risks calling further attention to the thrice-married Trumps own history with women.\n\nThe outburst was an extreme reminder of how Trump has seemed unable to restrain himself from veering into unhelpful territory, even with the election less than 40 days away. Trumps allies have implored him to stick to attacks on Mrs Clinton over her family foundation, her emails or her long history as a political insider, critiques that fall further out of view whenever Trump sparks a new controversy.\n\nRather than back way from the comments about Machado, Trump has repeatedly pushed it back to the centre of the conversation, even as early voting in critical states gets underway. He said this week that Machado had gained a massive amount of weight, adding that it was a real problem.\n\nOn Friday, Trump said Mrs Clinton had been set up by a con in holding up Machado as an angel without checking her past, which is terrible!\n\nHe suggested Mrs Clinton had helped the Venezuela-born actress gain citizenship.\n\nMrs Clintons campaign, which has released videos featuring Machado and arranged for reporters to interview her, has highlighted her status as a new American and her plans to cast her first vote for Mrs Clinton.\n\nMrs Clintons spokesman Brian Fallon took to Twitter to ask of Trump, What kind of human being is this? And her campaign chairman, John Podesta, tweeted that as a man of a certain age he shares Trumps urge to get up in the middle of the night but added a safety tip - dont reach for your phone.\n\nThe flurry on Twitter began shortly after 3am (5pm AEDT) on the East Coast when Trump complained about stories regarding his campaign that were based on anonymous sources and told his supporters not to believe them.\n\nThere are no sources, they are just made up lies! he wrote.\n\nTrump has repeatedly gotten himself in trouble with his late-night and early-morning tweets, which appear to be written by the candidate himself. The reality TV show star once said that aides help him tweet during the day but that in the evenings, he tweets by himself.\n\nTrump has, at various points during his campaign, toned down the content of his tweets, but rarely for long.\n\nHis latest broadside against Machado adds fuel to a burgeoning debate in America about slut-shaming, or putting down women over the perception of promiscuity. Womens advocates have said the phenomenon, which takes place largely online, holds women to a different standard because men are often praised for having multiple partners.\n\nA day earlier, Trump had warned voters that a Hillary Clinton victory would bring her husbands sex scandal back to the White House. It was Trumps latest effort to bounce back from Mondays debate performance, which was widely panned for being less effective than Mrs Clintons.\n\nThe American people have had it with years and decades of Clinton corruption and scandal. Corruption and scandal, Trump said on Thursday. An impeachment for lying. An impeachment for lying. Remember that? Impeach.\n\nThe fresh rehash of the 1990s Monica Lewisnky scandal came despite Trumps insistence that hes been showing impressive restraint by not bringing it up. Trump has said he declined to mention it during the debate out of respect for Mrs Clintons daughter, Chelsea, who was in the room.\n\nMrs Clinton has tried largely to stay out of the fracas over Trumps comments about women and her husband, hoping not to get in her opponents way while he keeps stepping into controversies her campaign sees as damaging his prospects. Asked on Thursday about the possibility that Trump would raise her husbands infidelities, Mrs Clinton said he could run his campaign however he chooses.\n\nThats up to him. Im going to keep talking about the stakes in this election, Mrs Clinton said.\n\nTrying to draw a contrast with Trump, Mrs Clinton has delivered a mostly positive message in the days since her debate performance re-energised her candidacy.','2017-03-25 03:51:14'),(616,80,'bbdfd5f847b10f8756c073592afba66049fddd34e7b1b15c9496e7918a453c4c','3972f57ea68e4ef9b6886e9a34982cdd','','','Rush Limbaugh was quick to dub newfound Trump campaign foe Alicia Machado porn star Miss Piggy because someone who looked like her once appeared in porn. It wasnt her, though.\n\nAlicia Machado, the former Miss Universe whom Donald Trump repeatedly attacked for her weight both in 1996 and this week, is a Venezuelan porn actress with a history of violence and palling around with shady characters running drug cartels. Thats how some of Trumps closest media allies and his armada of alt-right internet trolls are trying to frame the beauty queens life on Wednesday, at least.\n\nShe has become a U.S. citizen and you can bet she is going to vote this November, Clinton said. (Machado has been working and coordinating with the Clinton campaign for weeks now, having campaigned for Hillary and shot a video for her.)\n\nShe was the [Miss Universe] winner and, you know, she gained a massive amount of weight and it was a real problemwe had a real problem, Trump said on Fox News Tuesday morning, in defense of his past actions, which Machado claims caused her to have anorexia and bulimia for five years.\n\nNot only that, her attitude, and we had a real problem with her, so Hillary went back into the years and she found this girl and talked about her like she was Mother Teresa, he continued.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Trump campaign sent out talking points regarding Machado, stating that her claims weretotally baseless and unsubstantiated, and that she was trying to gain notoriety at the expense of Mr. Trumps name and reputation. But when The New York Times asked Trump about those claims in May, he simply replied: To that, I will plead guity.\n\n\n\nLess than a day after Clinton namechecked the former beauty queen at the presidential debate, Cosmopolitan and The Guardian both dropped largely positive profiles on Machado. (In Cosmos case, one with a photo spread, too.) Neither profile mentioned Machados tabloid-heavy past controversies, like when she was accused of driving the getaway car from the scene of a shooting in 1998. (A Venezuelan judge concluded that there was insufficient evidence to arrest her as a suspected accomplice in the attempted homicide. Her boyfriend at the time was indicted.)\n\nMiss Universe fat-shamed by Donald Trump was accused of threatening to kill a judge and being an accomplice to a MURDER bid in her native Venezuela, the Daily Mail reported on Tuesday, noting that it was unknown if [the] Clinton campaign vetted Machado.\n\nOther right-wing sites, including The Daily Caller, ran with the porn-star rumors. Outlets such as far right birther website WorldNetDaily and Fox News regurgitated the death-threat allegation and the murder-conspiracy angle.

One instance cited by Clinton occurred in 1996, when Trump called the recently crowned Miss Universe, Alicia Machado of Venezuela, Miss Piggy due to her post-pageant weight gain:\n\nCLINTON: This is a man who has called women pigs, slobs and dogs, and someone who has said pregnancy is an inconvenience to employers, who has said TRUMP: I never said that. CLINTON: . women dont deserve equal pay unless they do as good a job as men. CLINTON: And one of the worst things he said was about a woman in a beauty contest. He loves beauty contests, supporting them and hanging around them. And he called this woman Miss Piggy. Then he called her Miss Housekeeping, because she was Latina. Donald, she has a name. TRUMP: Where did you find this? Where did you find this? CLINTON: Her name is Alicia Machado.\n\nDespite suggesting during the debate that he had said no such thing, Trump defended his 1996 remarks about Machado the following day:\n\nShortly afterwards, various web sites began reporting that Machado, the former Miss Universe, had also appeared in pornographic videos:\n\nHowever, although searching on terms such as Alicia Machado Porn Star turns up several videos from free porn web sites, these videos dont actually star Alicia Machado:\n\nIt should come as no surprise that celebrity nude photographs and sex videos drive major traffic on the Internet. But when legitimate photographs or videos are not available, hoaxsters often resortto creating their own. In some cases, this involves Photoshopping a famous face onto a nude or near-nude body (as was done with Sarah Palin), or changing the title of a sex video if it features a porn actress who bears a resemblance to a celebrity\n\nThe latter is the case with Alicia Machado. In 2009, a video clip purportedly showing the former Miss Universe winner engaging in anal sex was circulated online, and that is the clip that now most frequently shows up in response to web searches on the phrase Alicia Machado porn. However, the woman seen in that video is not Alicia Machado  the clip was taken from the 2004 DVD Apprentass 4, which features porn actress Angel Dark, and was later retitled to suggest it showed Alicia Machado:\n\nThe two women bear a superficial resemblance to each other, but the woman in the film referenced above looks more like Angel Dark (first picture below) than Alicia Machado (second picture below):\n\nMachado is also often described as having been in a sex tape, a claim that stems from her 2005 appearance on the Spanish reality show La Granja (similar to the United States The Real World), which she was reportedly kicked off of after being filmed having sex with another cast member:\n\nThe romantic relationship between Alicia Machado and her fellow Venezuelan, baseball player Bob Abreu, is finished. The breakup was announced by the athlete himself in an interview with the Telefutura cable network. The remarks followed a scandal that erupted over Machados appearance on the Spanish television program La Granja. In the course of that reality show, the former Miss Universe and Spanish actor Fernando Acaso were filmed having sex. After the incident, the Venezuelan actress and singer was booted from the program, and two weeks ago she apologized on the air to her boyfriend. I never thought things would happen like that. [Fernando] behaved very respectfully towards her as a woman Abreu says. He also said that Machado would now have to think things through. Abreu emphasized that he is no longer Machados boyfriend and said their relationship had ended before Machado went to Spain to participate in La Granja.\n\n\n\nHowever, the so-called sex tape stemming from that incident is perhaps the tamest video ever to be so termed, consisting of nothing more than some grainy, night-vision footage of a couple of covered figures writhing in a bed. And reality television being what it is, the scene the tape depicts was quite possibly staged or fabricated.\n\nAlicia Machado did pose topless for Playboy magazine, though.','2017-03-25 03:51:14'),(620,81,'bc871ef720f4b624d0f09c435c2b3b287a218f24b1e2e8f364930578d9f3765a','8148a6da4b0e45a18fe1063d158cb3e0','','','To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nInspirational Christian speaker and author Joyce Meyer told her followers on Thursday that despite what some internet rumors are suggesting, she is alive and well and there is no need to be concerned about her.\n\nMeyer said in a Facebook videopost that rumors started online prompted many phone calls to her ministry with people concerned about her well-being, but she assured everyone that there is no need to worry.\n\n\"Hi everybody, it\'s Joyce.

This is the week of their sting-filled arrival. From Thursday through Saturday, bathers along Waikiki Beach in Hawaii, Swan River in Western Australia and parts of Guam, the Caribbean and the Great Barrier Reef may want to avoid the nearly transparent creatures.\n\nBlooms of thousands of species of jellyfish (not just box jellies) occur all over the world throughout the year. But the swarms of the Alatina alata, as it\'s known, are distinctive, said Dr. Angel Yanagihara, a biochemist and box jelly researcher at The University of Hawaii at Manoa, because of how predictably their reproductive patterns follow the moon. Every month, at the same time, hundreds to thousands fill the coastal waters. A swarm or bloom, as it is also called, lasts about three days, as they spawn.\n\nAfter which, they appear to all die, she said. The Waikiki Aquarium maintains a jellyfish bloom calendar for planning purposes.\n\nBox jellies, like coral, anemone and other jellyfish, are armed with cells that can be injected like venom harpoons into prey or predators. Human movement can trigger the jellies sensors to fire.\n\nAlthough it is uncommon, the stings of Alatina alata sometimes accompany severe symptoms that can send their victims to the hospital. Barring special creams, the best way to treat a sting, Dr. Yanagihara said, is to spray it with vinegar and then immerse it in hot water.\n\nThis particular box jelly is not to be confused with the basketball-size Australian Box Jelly (Chironex fleckeri), which is often referred to as the oceans most venomous animal. But, Dr. Yanagihara said these box jellies are like hot peppers  even small ones can pack a big punch.\n\nJOANNA KLEIN\n\nIf you capture an image of a jellyfish bloom where you live, tag it #nytscience on Instagram.

Comprised of 95 percent water and 5 percent a gelatinous material, jellyfish are found in all oceans and have more than 200 species. Believed to have existed on earth for over 650 million years, jellyfish predate dinosaurs. As their longevity on earth indicates, jellyfish are hardy survivors. They exist in all oceans, from the arctic to the tropics and from bays and estuaries to offshore and deep-ocean waters.\n\nJellyfish are not very sophisticated in their body development. They do not have a brain, heart, or eyes (with only one exception). They do not have bones or blood. Basically, they are packets of water and a combination of one percent nitrogen and carbon and three percent salt encased in two layers of tissue. The casing which contains this bell-shaped mass has an inner layer (endoderm) that lines its gut and an outer layer (ectoderm) that surrounds the jelly\n\nJellyfish have a simple nerve system to allow it to respond to food sources or danger from any direction. This system triggers responses to external stimuli, thereby allowing the jellyfish to trap food, realign its position in the water, and move slightly within their ocean world.\n\nJellyfish, along with corals and anemones, belong to the phylum Cnidaria (pronounced Nih DAR e uh). The cnid in Cnidaria refers to nettles, stinging barbs, called nematocysts. These microscopic weapons line the tentacles of the jellyfish and fire tiny venom-filled harpoons into organisms that brush against them. Then, appendages hanging from the bell near the mouth bring the startled prey to the mouth. In the rudimentary digestive system of the jellyfish, the mouth serves both for ingesting food and expelling waste. Thin canals transport nutrients throughout the body.\n\nLocomotion for jellyfish is a fairly tame act. They have limited control over movement, so their mobility is partly a matter of passive drifting on waves and currents. However, they can regulate vertical movement to some extent, employing a kind of jet propulsion. The tissue on the underside of the umbrella contracts, resulting in the water being pushed out of the hollow bell in one direction, thus propelling the jelly in the opposite direction.\n\nEcologically, jellyfish are an important link in the marine food web. While they are not typically an element of the human diet, they are a source of food for numerous fish species, as well as for marine birds, sea turtles, and other jellyfish. While only a few societies favor eating jellyfish, there is another area of human interaction  stinging upon contact in the ocean.\n\nWhen some jellyfish come in contact with humans, their released nettles may cause a burning sensation on the skin of humans. Most jellyfish stings are not very painful to humans, but may cause an allergic reaction in a small number of people.\n\nIn recent years, there has been considerable discussion among scientists about whether jellyfish are appearing in greater numbers around the world. Some say that climate change, ocean temperature variations, reductions in alpha predators, invasive species, and human interactions (pollution, runoff) have allowed massive blooms of jellyfish worldwide.\n\nThis is a difficult question to answer accurately because no one has tried to examine jellyfish blooms from all over the world before. When conditions are good (for example, the temperature is just right and there is plenty of food), it is normal for jellyfish to grow fast and reach large numbers. This just is part of the natural cycle of many species of jellyfish.\n\nLocally, we have seen a number of jellyfish blooms along our shores this summer. One bloom in particular arrived in June. It was the moon jellyfish and there were thousands of them in the water and on the beach. Four visiting grandchildren at my house were intrigued by them and, despite my advice, insisted on picking them up and staring at them, without any stings.\n\nScientists are researching the data, so whether there are increasing masses of jellyfish destined to take over the oceans remains an unknown for now. As the answers are learned, Ill report them here. In the meantime, be well and do something special for nature this week.\n\nFrank Gromling is the owner of Ocean Publishing in Flagler Beach.

Jellyfish are mysterious creatures with a nasty sting, and some experts fear a jellyfish invasion could be on the way.\n\nJust last week, a wave of jellyfish forced one of the world\'s largest nuclear reactors to shut down. Operators of the Oskarshamn nuclear plant in southeastern Sweden had to scramble a reactor at the nuclear plant after jellyfish clogged the pipes that bring in cool water to the plant\'s turbines.\n\nIt took three days to clean the pipes of the jellyfish.\n\nSome say this could become more common.\n\nExperts claim the creatures could wreak havoc in our oceans, posing a threat to human life and blocking up large coastal structures.\n\nThe problem, claim experts, could be largely caused by human activity in the ocean.\n\nComplex ecosystems used to keep the jellyfish at bay.

Also, jellyfish use litter, like industrial waste, to make large nurseries.\n\nOver fishing is also considered an issue.\n\nBut even on the most basic level jellyfish are hard to stop.\n\nAs one expert puts it, \'hermaphroditism, cloning, external fertilization, self-fertilization, courtship, copulation, fission, fusion, cannibalism you name it, jellyfish are doing it.\'\n\nOne type of jellyfish named the Mnemiopsis can lay eggs when it is just 13 days old without a mate. It can lay 10,000 eggs per day. It can eat more than ten times its own body weight in food, and it can double in size each day.\n\nThen there is the zombie jelly. This one is seemingly immortal.

With that kind of composition, it\'s no surprise that jellyfish lack brains and internal organs. Jellyfish function through a simple nervous system that helps them swim (though jellyfish mostly just float freely) and catch prey (usually small fish or other zooplankton).\n\nSince they have no digestive systems, jellyfish take food into their mouths, and then the food travels to the gastrovascular cavity, where it\'s digested.

Jellyfish are95 percent waterwith the rest of them accounting for minerals and proteins. Between their two dermis layers is a gelatinous, water-based substance calledmesogleathat contains muscle cells, nerve cells, and structural proteins.\n\nNuclear powerplants in Scotland, Sweden, California, Israel, and Japan have all been taken offline by slimy swarms of jellyfish.Power plants use outside water sources to cool down the fuel rods inside their reactor core. If this water contains jellies, they can clog up the system and force plants to shut down.\n\nAt any stage in its development, Turritopsisdohrniialso known asthe immortal jellyfish or theBenjamin Button jellyfishis capable of reversing its life cycle until it reverts to a polyp, from which it starts the whole process over again. Some scientists believe by aging backward to escape death this jellyfish has unlocked the key to immortality.\n\nJellyfish have inhabitedthe earths oceans for over650 million years, making them more ancient than sharks and dinosaurs.\n\nThePhialella zappaiwas named in honor ofFrank Zappa, the favorite musician of the scientist who discovered it. Zappa was quoted as saying, There is nothing I\'d like better than having ajellyfish named afterme.\"\n\nIn 1991, NASA made history by sending 2478 jellyfish polyps to space. It was part of an experiment called The Effects of Microgravity-Induced Weightlessness on Aurelia Ephyra Differentiation and Statolith Synthesis. The creatures were kept in flasks and bags that contained artificial seawater, which astronauts then injected with chemicals that encouraged them to reproduce. By the end of the experiment there were approximately 60,000 jellyfish in the Earths orbit.\n\nJellies dont have lungs, intestines, or stomachs, but they do use a much simpler system thats able to get the job done. Their bodies are composed of two cell layersthe external epidermis and the internal gastrodermis. The gastrodermis has one opening it uses to consume food, expel waste, and exchange reproductive materials. They are able to absorb oxygen and nutrients through the cell walls of their inner layer and even through their outer layer.\n\nThe largest jelly is the lions mane jellyfish, which grows up to 6 meters in diameter and has stinging tentacles up to 50 meters long. The smallest species is the Common Kingslayer. Its smaller than a fingernail and its also one of the most venomous creatures on earth.\n\nA few years ago, scientists from the Mayo Clinic injected unfertilized cat eggs with a green fluorescent protein found in crystal jellies and a gene from rhesus monkeys known to block the virus that causes feline AIDS. The only significance of the jellyfish protein was that it would indicate if the gene had successfully transferred. Sure enough, when the kittens were born, they glowed bright green when placed under a black light.\n\nSadly, thats not often used anymore. Thepreference these days is tocalla large gathering of jelliesa \"swarm.\"\n\nJellyfish can reproduce sexually by releasing sperm and eggs into the ocean where they form tiny, free-swimming larvae. These larvae then grow into polyps which attach to smooth surfaces and can split into numerous young jellyfish, thus reproducing asexually.\n\nResearchers atVirginiaTechhoping to build self-powered aquatic robots used jellyfish as a model, buildinga170 pound aquatic botthey dubbedCyro to test their idea. The propulsion system of a jellyfish runs on very little energy, which makes it a great model for autonomous, undersea robots of the future.\n\nSea turtles arent the only creatures that like to feast onjelliesnow and then. Blubber jellies, for example, are considered a delicacy in parts of Asia, and students at a Japanese high school once used powdered jellyfish to make salted caramels.\n\nInstead of a brain, jellies use a nerve net to process sensory information. Specialized structures likestatocystshelp jellyfish know if they\'re facing up or down, andrhopaliaallow them to sense light, chemicals and movement in the water. This is the most basic nervous system a multicellular organism can have, and its also found inhydrasand anemones.\n\nAll photos via Getty Images unless otherwise noted.','2017-03-25 03:51:14'),(633,82,'bcff06143c1ff8d015b9a5c62275cbbf48116eaf9e486b2d535f69d9184d653c','cff4274416174577ba5df91f25ed42f3','','','35 Interesting Facts About The World You Live In That Will Surprise You When Twister was introduced to the public in 1966 it was denounced by the media and accused of being sex in a box.\n\n \n\n There are more life forms living on the human skin than there are people roaming the Earth.\n\n \n\n Otters sleep holding hands.\n\n \n\n OJ Simpson was originally chosen to play in the box office hit Terminator but the studio was afraid no one would believe him as a remorseless killer.\n\n \n\n Leonardo Da Vinci could write with one hand while drawing with the other at the same time.\n\n \n\n Dueling is legal in Paraguay as long as both parties are registered blood donors.\n\n \n\n There are over 200 corpses on Mount Everest and climbers use them as way points.\n\n \n\n All the clocks in the movie Pulp Fiction are stuck at 4:20.\n\n \n\n Russia didnt acknowledge beer as alcoholic until 2011.

This is because jellyfish are about 95 percent water.\n\nLacking brains, blood, or even hearts, jellyfish are pretty simple critters. They are composed of three layers: an outer layer, called the epidermis; a middle layer made of a thick, elastic, jelly-like substance called mesoglea; and an inner layer, called the gastrodermis. An elementary nervous system, or nerve net, allows jellyfish to smell, detect light, and respond to other stimuli. The simple digestive cavity of a jellyfish acts as both its stomach and intestine, with one opening for both the mouth and the anus.\n\nThese simple invertebrates are members of the phylum Cnidaria, which includes creatures such as sea anemones, sea whips, and corals. Like all members of the phylum, the body parts of a jellyfish radiate from a central axis.

Supposedly, doctors have found that this type ofparacetamol contains the Machupo virus. According to the message,Machupo is one of the most dangerous viruses in the world and has a high mortality rate. The message asks you to share the information with others in the hope of saving lives.\n\nThankfully, however, the claims in the message are utter nonsense.\n\nThere are no credible news or health authority reports about such a paracetamol contamination. Nor have there been any officialrecalls of the supposedly contaminatedmedication. Of course, if the dangerous contamination describedin the message was really taking place, there would be widespread news and media coverage of the incident along with official health warnings to consumers. And, of course, any contaminated products would have been removed from store shelves as the result of an official recall. The complete absence of any official news or government reports about the alleged contamination is enough, of itself, to reveal the warning message as a hoax.\n\nMoreover, the Machupo virus is spread primarily viaaerosol transmission of dust particles from the faeces and urine of infected rodents. And, although viruses likeMachupomay survive for up to two weeks in blood specimens outside the host, it cannot survive in dry environments. Thus, it would seemextremely unlikely that the virus could somehow survive the manufacturing process of theparacetamol tablets and weeks or months of subsequent storage in shops and home medicine cabinets.\n\nIf the claims in the message were true, then, presumably, there would have been a recent spike in reported cases. But, I could find no information aboutsuch a spike. In fact, it appears that there have been no reported human cases for several years.\n\nIn short, this supposed warning is just one more variant in a long line of false and misleading contamination hoaxes that have circulated the Internet in various forms for many years. Sharing these false messages helps nobody. Sharing serves only to spread misinformation and needlessly cause fear and alarm.\n\nReferences\n\n Panadol Toxic To Body Warning Message\n\n Bananas Injected With HIV Hoax Warning\n\n HOAX  Cool Drink Contaminated With Ebola Virus\n\n MACHUPO VIRUS','2017-03-25 03:51:14'),(641,83,'c0e3910c7156bdfba7e925b70d8df03283b1ef021c7427899e179e090ca48add','df94452d08c3414c8ab6192df915a8fc','','','A post doing the rounds on social media claims Be careful not to take the paracetamol that comes written P/500.

Noor Hisham said the ministry had not received any reports regarding paracetamol contamination from authorities in manufacturing countries or any other country so far.\n\nWe were unable to locate any credible reports of paracetamol (or acetaminophen) contaminated by Machupo virus or any other.','2017-03-25 03:51:14'),(644,84,'c620f8c89d92e66c40558848b8b7c6bf1dbe5da0be2ffe8bbf8af08fa05d924f','915db4e8af6143a3ad9393586b632df1','','','For destination guides, travel tips, and more please visit SmarterTravel\n\nTo continue the conversation with other travelers we recommend TripAdvisor Forums','2017-03-25 03:51:14'),(645,84,'c620f8c89d92e66c40558848b8b7c6bf1dbe5da0be2ffe8bbf8af08fa05d924f','333da72262224772b1949da897776ee7','','','We arrived Yogyakarta at 06.00 in the morning. The flight was on time and soonest we get down from the plane, we went to the taxi counter and asked for a taxi to Jalan Sostrowijayan with the price of Rp. 25,000. The taxi driver droved us right to the alley of Sastrowijayan street (on the big road of Malioboro street) where you can find most of the home stay and budgeted hotels. We found Rezeki home stay and decided to stayed there for the holiday. Place is located at Gang I and was charging Rp. 35,000 per day excluding breakfast and with cold shower. In tat alley, you can find 3 bookstore and several restaurant. Alley was small but the atmosphere was good and friendly.\n\nIn Jogja, the society lives in peace and has typical hospitality. We went around the road and there were many kind people who will just show you the road and explain other things with good hospitality and sincere smile. But one must be caution with the people who tried to sell you batik or painting because these people are mostly known as the people who cheat the tourist by selling the fake and bad quality of handicraft or batik with a ridiculous high price.\n\nMalioboro street was heavy with the traffic, souvenirs shops, delman (horse carriage) and becak (people carriage). Price of food is slightly expensive along the road of Malioboro. At day time, the place was busy with the carriage food stall but when the night down, the carriage will be replace with the food served on the floor (called as lesehan). Normally most of the places will sell almost the same kind of food such as fish or chicken grill, some local foods and Chinese foods.\n\nHistorically, Yogyakarta was a sultanate. The governor of Yogyakarta until now has always been Sultans of Yogyakarta. The place is not too far from Malioboro street and still used as a real palace. We walked from the hotel to Keraton and paid Rp. 3,000 for the admission. Keraton is a really simple place by looking at the design and the architecture. Nothing much that we can see there but with the ticket price above, you can get a good guide to show you around the place and tell you historical things around the Keraton. After the Keraton, as recommended by the guide, we went to the art central. This is just a house which used for storing and showing art / painting. We went by becak which only cost us Rp. 3,000 to the place. The place was cozy with a lots of painting with different size and price. If you are interested to buy some batik painting then this is the good place to visit. The price is start from the small painting which cost Rp. 25,000 till the big painting which can cost millions rupiah. They will show you they way they wax and wash the paint to get the better background of the painting.\n\nNothing much we can do around Yogyakarta city except than going around under the sizzling weather and see the busy street of Malioboro.\n\nThe place we stayed had offered some package of tour such as 8 hours Borobudur tour with cost of Rp. 35,000 and Prambanan tour with the same price (both excluding entrance fee). We decided to go by ourselves to experience the bus and road of Yogyakarta.\n\nWe went out to Malioboro street and stop bus no. 4 to go to the bus terminal price of Rp. 1,000 per person. The terminal is actually not too far from the town but the bus has to go around to many places before it actually stops at the terminal. The drives took us around 45 minutes to terminal. We were joking saying that with Rp. 1,000 we managed to see whole Yogyakarta, in fact, this is true. From the terminal, we took another bus with the sign of Borobudur temple and paid Rp. 7,000 per person. The journey took 1 hour 45 minutes although the bus was driven very fast. We stopped at the terminal bus and walk another 1 km to reach the place. There were choices of Delman, Becak or you can easily walk to the temple. Entrance fee for tourist is USD 10 while for local is Rp. 7,000.\n\nBorobudur is one of best-preserved ancient monuments in the world and it is listed as one of the World Wonder Heritage. The monument is the biggest Buddhist temple of the world and it has been acclaimed by the world as a cultural heritage mankind that are the most frequently visited by over a million domestic as well as by foreign visitors up to now. The story of Borobudur is remain a mystery since no written documents had been found so far. Based on the brief inscription most scholars notified that Borobudur was built around 8th century when Samaratungga  King of Ceilendra Dynasty ruled Central Java. The meaning of Borobudur remain vague. It is a compound of words Bara and Budur. Bara from Sanskrit has a meaning of complex of the temples on monasteries while Budur reminds us of the Balinese word Beduhur, which means above. Accordingly Borobudur means Monastery on the hill. Borobudur has full of philosophical ornaments with reliefs engrave on the wall of the temples tell about the beautiful learning of life.\n\nWe spend lots of hours in Borobudur just by enjoying the nice view and sitting there reading our book. The air was good but too bad the weather was dull. Basically, no cloud because of the rain and we were little bit disappointed by the result of the dull pictures.\n\nOne bad thing about Borobudur is the hard time to find the way out. The compound was set in such way that we have to go trough all the souvenirs shops and went around and around to finally find the way out.\n\nToday, we did the same things as yesterday. Get into bus no. 4 to terminal and then get the bus to Prambanan. The bus fare is Rp. 3,000 per person. This time the bus driven very slowly as the bus driver has all the time in the world. It took us an hour or more to reach the place. We have to do another walk as well for another 1 km or so. Entrance fee is the same with Borobudur which is tourist USD 10 and local is Rp. 7,000.\n\nPrambanan is beautiful and fertile region. In ancient time, it was the place where the capital of a Kingdom  now known as Kraton Boko  stood. But it is pity that the ruins of the palace cannot give any hint about the existence of the Kingdom and those who had reigned there. A clearer hint is from Kalasans inscription which was written in Pranagari characters, dated from AD 778. This was clarified in the inscription of Raja Balitung from the year of AD 907. Raja Balitungs inscription mentions the pedigree of the kings who reigned in that period. It was the period when the Sanjaya dynasty reigned. Their religion was Hinduism.\n\nSimultaneously, during that very period, the dynasty of Cailendra, whose religion was Buddhism, was also blooming. This Cailendra dynasty had been closely related to the Kingdom of Sriwijaya in Palembang. At that particular time, Buddhism reached its peak and left many grand monuments which still stand to the present time.\n\nOn the day 4, we went to visit the famous Parang Tritis beach. We again, went to the bus terminal and find the bus to Parang Tritis. Cost for the fare is Rp. 8,000 per person and it took around 2 hours to get there.\n\nAccording to the local legend, Parangtritis beach claimed as the location of palace of Kanjeng Ratu Kidul, the ruler of the Southern Ocean invisible world. Regardless the truth of the legend, the beach is one of tourism site that you should visit.\n\nSwimming along the seashore is not allowed because waves are not too friendly. It wasnt really disappointing as walking around the seashores or eat the young coconuts is really nice and relaxing.','2017-03-25 03:51:14'),(646,84,'c620f8c89d92e66c40558848b8b7c6bf1dbe5da0be2ffe8bbf8af08fa05d924f','6c2aac0749cf456fbaf96193b04feb91','','','\n\n Borobudur[1] is a Buddhist stupa and temple complex in Central Java, Indonesia dating from the 8th century, and a UNESCO World Heritage Site. This is one of world\'s truly great ancient monuments, the single largest Buddhist structure anywhere on earth, and few who visit fail to be taken by both the scale of place, and the remarkable attention to detail that went into the construction. Set as it is in the heart of the verdant Kedu Plain, the backdrop of mighty active volcanoes only enhances the sense of awe and drama.\n\nThere is no definite written record of who built Borobudur or why it was built. It was likely founded as a religious site in the 8th century at the peak of the Sailendra dynasty in central Java. The construction is thought to have taken a period of 75 years, and completed in about 825CE.\n\nThe haphazard jumble of Hinduism and Buddhism from this period in Java\'s history can be baffling for visitors. Together with the records of many royal marriages between Hindu and Buddhist nobles, many Hindu and Buddhist monuments were constructed in the region at this time. For example, Borobudur and the nearby Hindu Prambanan temple complex were more or less contemporaneous. This, together with many records of royal marriages between Hindu and Buddhist nobles, has led academics to believe that there was little serious conflict concerning religion in central Java at this time.\n\nBorobudur lay abandoned and hidden for centuries under layers of volcanic ash and thick jungle growth. Nobody knows for sure why it was abandoned, although the popular theories are that the local population just became uninterested when there were mass conversions to Islam in the 15th century, or they were simply driven away by a large volcanic eruption. It was never forgotten entirely though, with local folklore ensuring that stories of the great monument lived on.\n\nFollowing the Anglo-Dutch Java War, Java was briefly under British administration from 1811 to 1816. The British governor was Thomas Stamford Raffles (the founder of Singapore), and he took a great practical and academic interest in the history of the mystical island of Java. On a tour to Semarang in 1814, he was informed about a huge lost monument deep in the jungles near Yogyakarta, and he sent a Dutch engineer to investigate. It took two months to clear the jungle and partially reveal the amazing monument, but it was not until 1885 that the complex was unearthed in its magnificent entirety. Raffles also presided over the re-discovery of nearby Prambanan, and it is somewhat ironic that the very brief British rule of Java led to the uncovering of both these ancient monuments.\n\nAppreciation and protection was surprisingly slow to develop, and Borobudur became the domain of unscrupulous souvenir hunters. Modern-day archaeologists speculate that this was due to the European obsession with Ancient Egypt at the time  Borobudur was just too remote and too far away to get the attention it undoubtedly deserved. There was even a Dutch proposal to dismantle the monument and scatter it piece-by-piece to museums around the world. Thankfully, good sense prevailed and by the end of the 19th century the site was left largely intact, and a five year restoration programme was undertaken in 1907.\n\nIn 1956 UNESCO began an assessment process for the full scale restoration of the monument. Finally in 1968, a major plan to restore Borobudur was created, and this huge project involved a complete overhaul of the monument up until 1983. The unsteady foundations were stabilized, everything was meticulously cleaned and a major drainage system installed. After the works were finished, UNESCO formally listed Borobudur as a World Heritage Site in 1991. Since then, the profile of Borobudur has increased enormously, and it is now a major international tourist attraction. Its statues, reliefs and stupas have spawned millions of replicas which adorn properties worldwide.\n\nThis huge popularity has its downsides. Both deliberate vandalism and general wear and tear are of great concern for the future integrity of the monument. Pleas for visitors not to touch anything are made in the form of signs, by broadcast warnings, and by the presence of guards, but this does not stop the problem. Many have called for the monument to be closed to casual visitors, and for access to be only via timed guided tours.\n\nAs well as being the single most popular tourist attraction in modern day Indonesia, Borobudur has resumed its role as an important place of worship and pilgrimage for Indonesian Buddhists. Visitors should be understanding and respectful of this, especially during major Buddhist holiday periods.\n\nBorobudur was heavily affected by the eruption of Mount Merapi in October and November 2010. Volcanic ash from Merapi fell on the temple complex, which is approximately 28 km (17.5 mi) west-southwest of the crater. During the strong eruption of 3-5 November for example, a layer of ash up to 2.5 cm (1 in) thick fell onto the temple. This also killed nearby vegetation. Experts feared that the acidic ash might severely damage the historic site. The temple complex was closed from 5-9 November 2010 to clean up that ash-fall, and the upper levels remained closed to the public until late September 2011. Upon reopening the upper levels, the Borobudur Conservation Agency announced that visitor numbers to those levels were restricted to under 82 people.\n\nUNESCO donated US$3 million as a part of rehabilitation costs to rid the temple\'s stones of volcanic sediment, then to plant trees to stabilise temperatures, and finally to support the living conditions of local residents. More than 55,000 stone blocks from the temple structure had to be dismantled to enable restoration of the drainage system, which had been clogged by slurry after rains. This restoration programme is predicted to be finished in November 2011.\n\nBorobudur lies in the the Kedu Plain - a very fertile volcanic plain between the twin volcanoes of Mount Sumbing and Mount Sundoro to the west, and Mount Merbabu and Mount Merapi to the east.\n\nThe nearest larger airports are Yogyakarta\'s Adisucipto International Airport (IATA: JOG) and Solo\'s Adisumarmo International Airport (IATA: SOC). Both are well connected domestically, and also offer some international connections to Singapore and Kuala Lumpur. AirAsia for example flies from Kuala Lumpur and Singapore to Yogyakarta daily.\n\nIt is possible, if one rushes oneself a bit, to visit Borobudur on a day trip from Bali or Jakarta.You can also via Semarang to Borobudur. There are direct flights from Kuala Lumpur and Singapore to Semarang with Air Asia\n\nThe public buses to Borobudur from Yogyakarta are aimed mostly at Indonesian visitors, and only a few tourists venture aboard, but it is simple. The buses to Borobudur leave from the Jombor bus terminal. You can get to the Jombor bus terminal by either taxi (the simplist) or by local bus. The Trans-Jogja busses 2B and 2A (Rp 3,600) runs from central Yogyakarta to Jombor bus terminal in northern Yogyakarta, where you can change to another bus to get to Borobudur Bus Terminal. The Trans-Jogja staff and Jombor station staff are very friendly and will direct you to the correct buses. Bus takes about 60-90 minutes, and will cost Rp 25,000 one way (pay on the bus). The bus will stop at Muntilan Bus Terminal inbetween for around 10-15 min. From Borobudur Bus Terminal walk 5 minutes to the south and reach the big parking lot of Brobudur Temple.\n\nOn arrival in Borobudur, exit the bus station and turn left (away from the arch like structure on the main road). There temple is only 100 m away. Many tricycle and horse cart operators will try to convince you that it is very far and want you to take their transportation.\n\nBuses run regularly from Magelang to Borobudur via Muntilan and are widely advertised there. The journey time is about 1 hour.\n\nThe Hindu Temple at Prambanan is located at the end station of TransJogya Route 1A. To get there is simple - Go with bus back to Jombor Terminal (If you sit in front the driver will tell you when they arrive at the terminal). Then go with TransJogya Buses through the city. In every TransJogya station exists a high-level map. Other version: To get from or to the Hindu temples at Prambanan, take a Yogyakarta bus and get down at Jombor Terminal (90 min, Rp 15,000 for visitors, Rp 7,000 for Indonesians). From Jombor take TransJogya route 2B to Prambanan (45-60 min, Rp 3,600). It will require 3 bus changes: 2B from Jombor to Terminal Condong, 3B from Terminal Condong to Maguwo (Jl. Solo) and 1A/B from Maguwo to Prambanan.\n\nFrom Semarang or Semarang Harbour you can go to Borobudur with rent car or tourist van with 7 seaters van,with 3 hours driving approximately.Like who operates transport with 7 seaters van in the central of java.\n\nTravel agents in Yogyakarta sell door-to-door minibus tour packages for around Rp 75,000. This is a good deal and a straightforward way to reach the monument, although some operators may stop off at batik and silver factories along the route. Many agents offer combined packages with Prambanan or Merpati, these are a good option to visit multiple destinations however ask around as prices vary wildly (from 60,000 Rp to 200,000 Rp).\n\nIf visiting both Borobudur and Prambanan temples you can buy a \'package\' ticket for both for $30, cheaper than paying both separately, these are available at either temple entrance though not advertised on the boards (the websites confirm that the ticket exist though). Free tea/coffe and bottled water is included. Tour operators may try to sell you a \'discount package\' including the entrance fees, assuring you it is cheaper than the individual entrance prices, this is true, but they neglect to tell you that the package ticket exists!\n\nAlso note, the early morning packages are offered with or without breakfast for 10,000 extra. Better to choose without as the included breakfast, provided at one of the many food stalls outside the temple complex, consists of a small plate of fruit salad and some poor quality toast and jam. For 10,000 you could buy yourself something of your choosing that would be better value (bakso is 8000 at most stalls for example).\n\nBorobudur is about 60 to 90 minutes north of Yogyakarta by car, depending on traffic condition as the roads from Yogyakarta to Borobudur can be very congested during daytime. Most of the route is on a well-maintained (for Indonesia) four-lane (in many places) highway, and there are frequent bus services (see above). A taxi from central Yogyakarta to Borobudur costs around Rp 200,000, and fixed price taxi from the taxi counter at Yogyakarta airport is Rp 190,000.\n\nThe nearest stations are in Yogyakarta which is the major rail hub of Central Java. Connections are frequent from major cities in the west such as Jakarta and Bandung, and in the east such as Surabaya. From the main Tugu station it is easy to arrange taxi or bus transfers to Borobudur.\n\nThe only practical means of getting around Borobudur is on foot. A toy train of limited practical use shuttles around the temple, and between the museum and entrance gate for Rp 5,000 a throw.\n\nIf you are staying in the area, most local hotels and guesthouses will rent bicycles for about Rp 30,000-50,000 per day. This is a good way of exploring the other sights and local villages around Borobudur.\n\nFor those with longer stays, a hired car offers opportunities to explore the beautiful waterfalls and rice terraces of Selo Griyo in the surrounding mountains. The cost is usually at Rp 500,000 per day. Wanto [esmawanto@gmail.com] is friendly, knowledgable, and can guide you to delightful surprises in the area.\n\nIf visiting both Borobudur and Prambanan temples you can buy a \'package\' ticket for both for $32 (Rp. 420,000), available at either temple entrance though not advertised on the boards. These tickets are valid for two days, including your day of purchase. There is also a combination ticket for students, costing $15 (Rp. 210,000). In June 2016, the price for the package ticket has increased to US$ 32, but they charged you slightly more (Rp 432,000).\n\nThe site is open to public entrance from 6AM-5PM. However, the Manohara Hotel (see Sleep) runs a daily Borobudur Sunrise Tour ][5] for Rp 450,000 for foreigners (Rp 250,000 if you are a hotel guest) and Rp 270,000 for Indonesians, which gets you a flashlight and an escort to the temple gate at 4:30AM. This is in time to see the sunrise, and to explore for an hour and a half before the hordes arrive. This is well worth the money if the sky is clear; otherwise arriving around 5:45am would make no difference. The sun rises in the same direction as the entrance you used to gain access to the temple. The top few levels offer a great view wherever you position yourself. If you\'re so inclined, grab a private spot facing East and enjoy your own precious few minutes of reflection (or photography).\n\nHiring a guide at the gate who can explain the reliefs in some detail costs Rp 75,000-100,000 per hour. Some guides may insist on a minimum time of two hours. You should ask for a guide in the evening before going to tour in the morning. It is also perfectly possible to roll up and find a guide available, it all depends on how busy the site is. Guides speaking European languages other than English may be available. For the sunrise tour, the Manahora will arrange a guide for Rp 200,000 (although the guide might try and charge 250,000).\n\nIn April 2011 it was announced that to assist in the ongoing preservation of the temple, future visitors would be required to view the temple in groups of no more than 30 persons and must be accompanied by Taman Wisata Candi Borobudur (TWCB) staff members.\n\nVisitors are required to wear a sarong whilst visiting the temple, although the rule doesn\'t appear to be strictly enforced. If you do not bring your own, then one is provided free with the entrance ticket. These are available at a post located at the bottom of the temple entrance stairs, and should be returned before leaving at an exit post.\n\nThe main site is approached through a large open and pleasant park inside the complex.\n\nSince July 2012, overseas visitor can purchase entrance tickets online officially through www.kiostix.com.\n\nBorobudur consists of six square platforms topped by three circular platforms, and is decorated with no less than 2,672 relief panels and 504 Buddha statues of various types. The main dome, located at the centre of the top platform, is surrounded by 72 Buddha statues seated inside perforated stupas. The square base is 118 m (387 ft) long on each side, and the highest point 35 m (114 ft) above ground level.\n\nThe whole monument is constructed from dark grey andesite stone, and so synonymous has this become with Borobudur and other temples on the Kedu Plain, that Indonesian for the material is simply batu candi (temple stone).\n\nClimbing the structure takes a little bit of effort, and the dark stone absorbs the sun\'s heat rapidly to make walking and climbing quite hot work by early afternoon. If you have but modest stamina or heat tolerance, you should start as early in the day as possible, and take plenty of water with you. Some free bottled water and coffee usually comes with the ticket for international visitors.\n\nThe single stupendously large structure can be divided into layers as follows:\n\nThe monument\'s three divisions (the square terraces and central stupa at the peak are regarded as one division) symbolise the three realms of Buddhist cosmology, namely Kamadhatu (the world of desires), Rupadhatu (the world of forms), and finally Arupadhatu (the formless world).\n\nThere are six different postures of Buddha\'s statue from the bottom level to the top. These are contact with earth, giving and helping, meditation, fearlesness, teach and learn, and finally turning the wheel of dharma.\n\nYou can think of Borobudur as a very large teaching graphic recounting the life story of the Buddha, his teachings and his progress towards Nirvana. If you want to truly understand the reliefs, it is best to employ a guide to explain the stories to you.\n\nIn summary, the 2,760 reliefs tell four key sets of stories in the form of carved illustrations and Sanskrit inscriptions:\n\nThere are two museums located within Borobudur Archaeological Park, the Karmawibhanga Museum and the Samudraraksa Museum. These museums are housed inside the park just a few hundred metres to the north of the temple. These museum ticket are already included within the Borobudur entrance ticket, so visitor are free to enter the museum.\n\nThe Samudraraksa Museum display the actual size replica of Borobudur Ship. It also display the maritime technology and trade network of 8th century Asia and Africa, especially the maritime trade of Indian Ocean. In 1982 a British naval history scholar called Philip Beale was visiting Borobudur when he noticed 10 panels depicting ocean-going ships. He surmised that these ships may have been a part of a famous shipping route  the Cinnamon Route  that linked Indonesia to Africa many centuries earlier. This led Beale to build a model ship based on those depictions, and that is now housed in its own dedicated space within the museum.\n\nThe Karmawibhanga Museum display archaeological findings around Borobudur, the restoration process, as well as the photographs of Karmawibhanga relief on hidden foot of Borobudur. It does a sometimes haphazard job of presenting the restoration process. Perhaps the most interesting exhibitions about this are those of the law of karma reliefs, with explanatory comments, and the photo gallery of late 19th-century shots of the complex before it was restored.\n\nThe museum is open daily 6AM-6PM and entry is included with the main Borobudur ticket.\n\nBetween Yogyakarta and Magelang lies the volcanic Kedu Plain. This was clearly an important area in pre-10th century Javanese history as it contains a whole host of ruins (both Buddhist and Hindu) dating from the same era as Borobudur, and easily reached from there. If you have a car, the most accessible of these together make an interesting use of the late part of the day on the way back to Yogyakarta after you have seen Borobudur. Alternatively, if you are staying in the Borobudur area, rent a bicycle and explore these temples together with the verdant local countryside.\n\nA combined ticket for entrance to both Candi Mendut and Candi Pawon costs Rp 3500. You should be able to visit any of these in the hours of daylight.\n\nIf you are still at Borobudur in the late afternoon, return to the top level for sunset. It is often very quiet at this time, and the sunset behind the mountains to the west is quite magical.\n\nPersistent touts hassle tourists on the approaches to the temple but are usually kept away from the temple itself. Be firm and polite about your intentions and they will soon get the message. Be careful when you exit the temple as there are confusing signs pointing to exit gates which lead you through a maze of stalls. If you want to avoid the maze of handycraft stall, do not turn left and follow the nearest exit sign, just move straight forward to the exit located nearest to the entrance.\n\nIf you do intend to buy some souvenirs here then make sure your bargaining skills are at their best. Pedlars sell small statues that they claim are carved from lava stone, but most are cast coloured cement. Identifying genuine lava stone is easy enough as the stone is quite light for its size compared to the weightier concrete. Nonetheless, if a concrete Buddha head will suffice you should not pay more than Rp 20.000. Their first offer is around Rp 150.000. Just tell them, that you already bought for Rp 20.000 and they will give you this price. An authentic lava stone version carved by a skilled craftsman will cost, and be worth, considerably more.\n\nShould you be in need of cash, there is a Bank Negara Indonesia (BNI) ATM close to the main park entrance.\n\nMuntilan is a market town on the main route from Yogyakarta to Borobudur, and it has developed as a leading manufacturing centre of carved stone Borobudur replicas. If you are thinking of buying a stone Buddha, stupa or wall relief, this should be your port of call.\n\nMuntilan is 13-14 km (8.5 mi) back towards Yogyakarta from Borobudur on the main road (Jalan Magelang). You cannot fail to find it.\n\nThe bus station area is home to a multitude of hawker stalls selling standard Indonesian street food and all manner of drinks.\n\nThe vast majority of visitors stay in Yogyakarta and a few in Magelang, though it is well worth spending the night at Borobudur, as this will give you a chance the following morning to get to the temples before the crowds arrive. Indeed, if you really want to explore and understand this magnificent monument, over-nighting in the immediate area is vital.\n\nThere are a few losmen (guesthouses) and basic hotels in the village of Borobudur just south of the park entrance. Owing to the site\'s popularity with tourists prices are, by Indonesian standards, somewhat inflated for what you get.\n\nBe nice to the locals. Seriously. There is a lot written in travel guides about the pushy nature of the vendors at Borobudur, and they can be a little annoying it must be said, but a few friendly \"No\'s\" and keeping on walking usually does the job.\n\nYogyakarta is a great seat of learning in Indonesia, and you will often find many students at Borobudur who are keen to be friendly with you. Take this how it is meant; they are genuinely friendly, and rightly very proud of their heritage and keen to talk to you about it. To avoid the largest crowds, skip weekends when large numbers of domestic tourists visit, along with the occasional school trip of students, sent by their teachers to practice their English on overseas visitors. Alternatively, visit as early as you can in the morning.\n\nIf you look vaguely foreign, you\'ll be a bigger tourist attraction to school students than the monument itself. Expect to be filmed or audio recorded as students ask you all sorts of harmless questions and perhaps ask for a photo with you. They are highly appreciative of your interaction with them and are lovely.','2017-03-25 03:51:14'),(647,84,'c620f8c89d92e66c40558848b8b7c6bf1dbe5da0be2ffe8bbf8af08fa05d924f','75e2cd0b9eb84be2a567585c1e7e7bf8','','','Borobudur, or Barabudur (Indonesian: Candi Borobudur) is a 9th-century Mahayana Buddhist temple in Magelang, Central Java, Indonesia, as well as the world\'s largest Buddhist temple,[1][2] and also one of the greatest Buddhist monuments in the world.[3] The temple consists of nine stacked platforms, six square and three circular, topped by a central dome. The temple is decorated with 2,672 relief panels and 504 Buddha statues. The central dome is surrounded by 72 Buddha statues, each seated inside a perforated stupa.[4]\n\nBuilt in the 9th century during the reign of the Sailendra Dynasty, the temple was designed in Javanese Buddhist architecture, which blends the Indonesian indigenous cult of ancestor worship and the Buddhist concept of attaining Nirvana.[3] The temple also demonstrates the influences of Gupta art that reflects India\'s influence on the region, yet there are enough indigenous scenes and elements incorporated to make Borobudur uniquely Indonesian.[5][6] The monument is both a shrine to the Lord Buddha and a place for Buddhist pilgrimage. The journey for pilgrims begins at the base of the monument and follows a path around the monument and ascends to the top through three levels symbolic of Buddhist cosmology: Kmadhtu (the world of desire), Rupadhatu (the world of forms) and Arupadhatu (the world of formlessness). The monument guides pilgrims through an extensive system of stairways and corridors with 1,460 narrative relief panels on the walls and the balustrades. Borobudur has the largest and most complete ensemble of Buddhist reliefs in the world.[3]\n\nEvidence suggests Borobudur was constructed in the 9th century and abandoned following the 14th-century decline of Hindu kingdoms in Java and the Javanese conversion to Islam.[7] Worldwide knowledge of its existence was sparked in 1814 by Sir Thomas Stamford Raffles, then the British ruler of Java, who was advised of its location by native Indonesians. Borobudur has since been preserved through several restorations. The largest restoration project was undertaken between 1975 and 1982 by the Indonesian government and UNESCO, following which the monument was listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.[3]\n\nBorobudur is still used for pilgrimage; once a year, Buddhists in Indonesia celebrate Vesak at the monument, and Borobudur is Indonesia\'s single most visited tourist attraction.[8][9][10]\n\nIn Indonesian, ancient temples are referred to as candi; thus locals refer to \"Borobudur Temple\" as Candi Borobudur. The term candi also loosely describes ancient structures, for example gates and baths. The origins of the name Borobudur, however, are unclear,[11] although the original names of most ancient Indonesian temples are no longer known.[11] The name Borobudur was first written in Sir Thomas Raffles\'s book on Javan history.[12] Raffles wrote about a monument called Borobudur, but there are no older documents suggesting the same name.[11] The only old Javanese manuscript that hints the monument called Budur as a holy Buddhist sanctuary is Nagarakretagama, written by Mpu Prapanca, a Buddhist scholar of Majapahit court, in 1365.[13]\n\nMost candi are named after a nearby village. If it followed Javanese language conventions and was named after the nearby village of Bore, the monument should have been named \"BudurBoro\". Raffles thought that Budur might correspond to the modern Javanese word Buda (\"ancient\")i.e., \"ancient Boro\". He also suggested that the name might derive from boro, meaning \"great\" or \"honourable\" and Budur for Buddha.[11] However, another archaeologist suggests the second component of the name (Budur) comes from Javanese term bhudhara (\"mountain\").[14]\n\nAnother possible etymology suggests that Borobudur is a corrupted simplified local Javanese pronunciation of Biara Beduhur written in Sanskrit as Vihara Buddha Uhr. The term Buddha-Uhr could mean \"the city of Buddhas\", while another possible term Beduhur is probably an Old Javanese term, still survived today in Balinese vocabulary, which means \"a high place\", constructed from the stem word dhuhur or luhur (high). This suggests that Borobudur means vihara of Buddha located on a high place or on a hill.[15]\n\nThe construction and inauguration of a sacred Buddhist buildingpossibly a reference to Borobudurwas mentioned in two inscriptions, both discovered in Kedu, Temanggung Regency. The Karangtengah inscription, dated 824, mentioned a sacred building named Jinalaya (the realm of those who have conquered worldly desire and reached enlightenment), inaugurated by Pramodhawardhani, daughter of Samaratungga. The Tri Tepusan inscription, dated 842, is mentioned in the sima, the (tax-free) lands awarded by r Kahulunnan (Pramodhawardhani) to ensure the funding and maintenance of a Kamln called Bhmisambhra.[16] Kamln is from the word mula, which means \"the place of origin\", a sacred building to honor the ancestors, probably those of the Sailendras. Casparis suggested that Bhmi Sambhra Bhudhra, which in Sanskrit means \"the mountain of combined virtues of the ten stages of Boddhisattvahood\", was the original name of Borobudur.[17]\n\nApproximately 40 kilometres (25mi) northwest of Yogyakarta and 86 kilometres (53mi) west of Surakarta, Borobudur is located in an elevated area between two twin volcanoes, Sundoro-Sumbing and Merbabu-Merapi, and two rivers, the Progo and the Elo. According to local myth, the area known as Kedu Plain is a Javanese \"sacred\" place and has been dubbed \"the garden of Java\" due to its high agricultural fertility.[18] During the restoration in the early 20th century, it was discovered that three Buddhist temples in the region, Borobudur, Pawon and Mendut, are positioned along a straight line.[19] A ritual relationship between the three temples must have existed, although the exact ritual process is unknown.[13]\n\nSpeculation about the lake\'s existence was the subject of intense discussion among archaeologists in the 20th century. In 1931, a Dutch artist and scholar of Hindu and Buddhist architecture, W.O.J. Nieuwenkamp, developed a theory that the Kedu Plain was once a lake and Borobudur initially represented a lotus flower floating on the lake.[14] It has been claimed that Borobudur was built on a bedrock hill, 265m (869ft) above sea level and 15m (49ft) above the floor of a dried-out paleolake.[20]\n\nDumaray together with Professor Thanikaimoni had taken soil samples in 1974 and again in 1977 from trial trenches that had been dug into the hill, as well as from the plain immediately to the south. These samples were later analysed by Professor Thanikaimoni, who examined their pollen and spore content in order to identify the type of vegetation that had grown in the area around the time of Borobudur\'s construction. They were unable to discover any pollen or spore samples that were characteristic of any vegetation known to grow in an aquatic environment such as a lake, pond or marsh. The area surrounding Borobudur appears to have been surrounded by agricultural land and palm trees at the time of the monument\'s construction, as is still the case today. Caesar Vote and the geomorphologist Dr J.J. Nossin in 198586 field studies re-examined the Borobudur lake hypothesis and concluded the absence of a lake around Borobudur at the time of its construction and active use as a sanctuary. These findings A New Perspective on Some Old Questions Pertaining to Borobudur were published in the 2005 UNESCO publication titled \"The Restoration of Borobudur\".\n\nThere is no written record of who built the Borobudur or of its intended purpose.[21] The construction time has been estimated by comparison between carved reliefs on the temple\'s hidden foot and the inscriptions commonly used in royal charters during the 8th and 9th centuries. Borobudur was likely founded around 800 CE.[21] This corresponds to the period between 760 and 830CE, the peak of the Sailendra dynasty rule of Mataram kingdom in central Java,[22] when it was under the influence of the Srivijayan Empire. The construction has been estimated to have taken 75 years and was completed during the reign of Samaratungga in 825.[23][24]\n\nThere is confusion between Hindu and Buddhist rulers in Java around that time. The Sailendras were known as ardent followers of Buddhism, though stone inscriptions found at Sojomerto suggest they may have been Hindus.[23] It was during this time that many Hindu and Buddhist monuments were built on the plains and mountains around the Kedu Plain. The Buddhist monuments, including Borobudur, were erected around the same period as the Hindu Shiva Prambanan temple compound. In 732CE, the Shivaite King Sanjaya commissioned a Shivalinga sanctuary to be built on the Wukir hill, only 10km (6.2mi) east of Borobudur.[25]\n\nConstruction of Buddhist temples, including Borobudur, at that time was possible because Sanjaya\'s immediate successor, Rakai Panangkaran, granted his permission to the Buddhist followers to build such temples.[26] In fact, to show his respect, Panangkaran gave the village of Kalasan to the Buddhist community, as is written in the Kalasan Charter dated 778 CE.[26] This has led some archaeologists to believe that there was never serious conflict concerning religion in Java as it was possible for a Hindu king to patronize the establishment of a Buddhist monument; or for a Buddhist king to act likewise.[27] However, it is likely that there were two rival royal dynasties in Java at the timethe Buddhist Sailendra and the Saivite Sanjayain which the latter triumphed over their rival in the 856 battle on the Ratubaka plateau.[28] This confusion also exists regarding the Lara Jonggrang temple at the Prambanan complex, which was believed to have been erected by the victor Rakai Pikatan as the Sanjaya dynasty\'s reply to Borobudur,[28] but others suggest that there was a climate of peaceful coexistence where Sailendra involvement exists in Lara Jonggrang.[29]\n\nBorobudur lay hidden for centuries under layers of volcanic ash and jungle growth. The facts behind its abandonment remain a mystery. It is not known when active use of the monument and Buddhist pilgrimage to it ceased. Sometime between 928 and 1006, King Mpu Sindok moved the capital of the Medang Kingdom to the region of East Java after a series of volcanic eruptions; it is not certain whether this influenced the abandonment, but several sources mention this as the most likely period of abandonment.[7][20] The monument is mentioned vaguely as late as 1365, in Mpu Prapanca\'s Nagarakretagama, written during the Majapahit era and mentioning \"the vihara in Budur\".[30] Soekmono (1976) also mentions the popular belief that the temples were disbanded when the population converted to Islam in the 15th century.[7]\n\nThe monument was not forgotten completely, though folk stories gradually shifted from its past glory into more superstitious beliefs associated with bad luck and misery. Two old Javanese chronicles (babad) from the 18th century mention cases of bad luck associated with the monument. According to the Babad Tanah Jawi (or the History of Java), the monument was a fatal factor for Mas Dana, a rebel who revolted against Pakubuwono I, the king of Mataram in 1709.[7] It was mentioned that the \"Redi Borobudur\" hill was besieged and the insurgents were defeated and sentenced to death by the king. In the Babad Mataram (or the History of the Mataram Kingdom), the monument was associated with the misfortune of Prince Monconagoro, the crown prince of the Yogyakarta Sultanate in 1757.[31] In spite of a taboo against visiting the monument, \"he took what is written as the knight who was captured in a cage (a statue in one of the perforated stupas)\". Upon returning to his palace, he fell ill and died one day later.\n\nFollowing its capture, Java was under British administration from 1811 to 1816. The appointed governor was Lieutenant Governor-General Thomas Stamford Raffles, who took great interest in the history of Java. He collected Javanese antiques and made notes through contacts with local inhabitants during his tour throughout the island. On an inspection tour to Semarang in 1814, he was informed about a big monument deep in a jungle near the village of Bumisegoro.[31] He was not able to make the discovery himself and sent H.C. Cornelius, a Dutch engineer, to investigate. In two months, Cornelius and his 200 men cut down trees, burned down vegetation and dug away the earth to reveal the monument. Due to the danger of collapse, he could not unearth all galleries. He reported his findings to Raffles, including various drawings. Although the discovery is only mentioned by a few sentences, Raffles has been credited with the monument\'s recovery, as one who had brought it to the world\'s attention.[12]\n\nHartmann, a Dutch administrator of the Kedu region, continued Cornelius\'s work, and in 1835, the whole complex was finally unearthed. His interest in Borobudur was more personal than official. Hartmann did not write any reports of his activities, in particular, the alleged story that he discovered the large statue of Buddha in the main stupa.[32] In 1842, Hartmann investigated the main dome, although what he discovered is unknown and the main stupa remains empty.\n\nThe Dutch East Indies government then commissioned F.C. Wilsen, a Dutch engineering official, who studied the monument and drew hundreds of relief sketches. J.F.G. Brumund was also appointed to make a detailed study of the monument, which was completed in 1859. The government intended to publish an article based on Brumund\'s study supplemented by Wilsen\'s drawings, but Brumund refused to cooperate. The government then commissioned another scholar, C. Leemans, who compiled a monograph based on Brumund\'s and Wilsen\'s sources. In 1873, the first monograph of the detailed study of Borobudur was published, followed by its French translation a year later.[32] The first photograph of the monument was taken in 1872 by a Dutch-Flemish engraver, Isidore van Kinsbergen.[33]\n\nAppreciation of the site developed slowly, and it served for some time largely as a source of souvenirs and income for \"souvenir hunters\" and thieves. In 1882, the chief inspector of cultural artifacts recommended that Borobudur be entirely disassembled with the relocation of reliefs into museums due to the unstable condition of the monument.[33] As a result, the government appointed Groenveldt, an archaeologist, to undertake a thorough investigation of the site and to assess the actual condition of the complex; his report found that these fears were unjustified and recommended it be left intact.\n\nBorobudur was considered as the source of souvenirs, and parts of its sculptures were looted, some even with colonial-government consent. In 1896 King Chulalongkorn of Siam visited Java and requested and was allowed to take home eight cartloads of sculptures taken from Borobudur. These include thirty pieces taken from a number of relief panels, five buddha images, two lions, one gargoyle, several kala motifs from the stairs and gateways, and a guardian statue (dvarapala). Several of these artifacts, most notably the lions, dvarapala, kala, makara and giant waterspouts are now on display in the Java Art room in The National Museum in Bangkok.[34]\n\nBorobudur attracted attention in 1885, when Yzerman, the Chairman of the Archaeological Society in Yogyakarta, made a discovery about the hidden foot.[35] Photographs that reveal reliefs on the hidden foot were made in 18901891.[36] The discovery led the Dutch East Indies government to take steps to safeguard the monument. In 1900, the government set up a commission consisting of three officials to assess the monument: Brandes, an art historian, Theodoor van Erp, a Dutch army engineer officer, and Van de Kamer, a construction engineer from the Department of Public Works.\n\nIn 1902, the commission submitted a threefold plan of proposal to the government. First, the immediate dangers should be avoided by resetting the corners, removing stones that endangered the adjacent parts, strengthening the first balustrades and restoring several niches, archways, stupas and the main dome. Second, after fencing off the courtyards, proper maintenance should be provided and drainage should be improved by restoring floors and spouts. Third, all loose stones should be removed, the monument cleared up to the first balustrades, disfigured stones removed and the main dome restored. The total cost was estimated at that time around 48,800 Dutch guilders.\n\nThe restoration then was carried out between 1907 and 1911, using the principles of anastylosis and led by Theodor van Erp.[37] The first seven months of restoration were occupied with excavating the grounds around the monument to find missing Buddha heads and panel stones. Van Erp dismantled and rebuilt the upper three circular platforms and stupas. Along the way, Van Erp discovered more things he could do to improve the monument; he submitted another proposal, which was approved with the additional cost of 34,600 guilders. At first glance, Borobudur had been restored to its old glory. Van Erp went further by carefully reconstructing the chhatra (three-tiered parasol) pinnacle on top of the main stupa. However, he later dismantled the chhatra, citing that there were not enough original stones used in reconstructing the pinnacle, which means that the original design of Borobudur\'s pinnacle is actually unknown. The dismantled chhatra now is stored in Karmawibhangga Museum, a few hundred meters north from Borobudur.\n\nDue to the limited budget, the restoration had been primarily focused on cleaning the sculptures, and Van Erp did not solve the drainage problem. Within fifteen years, the gallery walls were sagging, and the reliefs showed signs of new cracks and deterioration.[37] Van Erp used concrete from which alkali salts and calcium hydroxide leached and were transported into the rest of the construction. This caused some problems, so that a further thorough renovation was urgently needed.\n\nSmall restorations have been performed since then, but not sufficient for complete protection. During World War II and Indonesian National Revolution in 1945 to 1949, Borobudur restoration efforts were halted. The monument suffered further from the weather and drainage problems, which caused the earth core inside the temple to expand, pushing the stone structure and tilting the walls. By 1950s some parts of Borobudur were facing imminent danger of collapsing. In 1965, Indonesia asked the UNESCO for advice on ways to counteract the problem of weathering at Borobudur and other monuments. In 1968 Professor Soekmono, then head of the Archeological Service of Indonesia, launched his \"Save Borobudur\" campaign, in an effort to organize a massive restoration project.[38]\n\nIn the late 1960s, the Indonesian government had requested from the international community a major renovation to protect the monument. In 1973, a master plan to restore Borobudur was created.[39] The Indonesian government and UNESCO then undertook the complete overhaul of the monument in a big restoration project between 1975 and 1982.[37] In 1975, the actual work began. Over one million stones were dismantled and removed during the restoration, and set aside like pieces of a massive jig-saw puzzle to be individually identified, catalogued, cleaned and treated for preservation. Borobudur became a testing ground for new conservation techniques, including new procedures to battle the microorganisms attacking the stone.[38] The foundation was stabilized, and all 1,460 panels were cleaned. The restoration involved the dismantling of the five square platforms and the improvement of drainage by embedding water channels into the monument. Both impermeable and filter layers were added. This colossal project involved around 600 people to restore the monument and cost a total of US$6,901,243.[40]\n\nAfter the renovation was finished, UNESCO listed Borobudur as a World Heritage Site in 1991.[3] It is listed under Cultural criteria (i) \"to represent a masterpiece of human creative genius\", (ii) \"to exhibit an important interchange of human values, over a span of time or within a cultural area of the world, on developments in architecture or technology, monumental arts, town-planning or landscape design\", and (vi) \"to be directly or tangibly associated with events or living traditions, with ideas, or with beliefs, with artistic and literary works of outstanding universal significance\".[3]\n\nFollowing the major 1973 renovation funded by UNESCO,[39] Borobudur is once again used as a place of worship and pilgrimage. Once a year, during the full moon in May or June, Buddhists in Indonesia observe Vesak (Indonesian: Waisak) day commemorating the birth, death, and the time when Siddhrtha Gautama attained the highest wisdom to become the Buddha Shakyamuni. Vesak is an official national holiday in Indonesia,[41] and the ceremony is centered at the three Buddhist temples by walking from Mendut to Pawon and ending at Borobudur.[42]\n\nThe monument is the single most visited tourist attraction in Indonesia. In 1974, 260,000 tourists, of whom 36,000 were foreigners, visited the monument.[9] The figure climbed to 2.5 million visitors annually (80% were domestic tourists) in the mid-1990s, before the country\'s economic crisis.[10] Tourism development, however, has been criticized for not including the local community, giving rise to occasional conflicts.[9] In 2003, residents and small businesses around Borobudur organized several meetings and poetry protests, objecting to a provincial government plan to build a three-storey mall complex, dubbed the \"Java World\".[43]\n\nInternational tourism awards were given to Borobudur archaeological park, such as PATA Grand Pacific Award 2004, PATA Gold Award Winner 2011, and PATA Gold Award Winner 2012. In June 2012, Borobudur was recorded in the Guinness Book of World Records as the world\'s largest Buddhist archaeological site.[44]\n\nUNESCO identified three specific areas of concern under the present state of conservation: (i) vandalism by visitors; (ii) soil erosion in the south-eastern part of the site; and (iii) analysis and restoration of missing elements.[45] The soft soil, the numerous earthquakes and heavy rains lead to the destabilization of the structure. Earthquakes are by far the most important contributing factors, since not only do stones fall down and arches crumble, but the earth itself can move in waves, further destroying the structure.[45] The increasing popularity of the stupa brings in many visitors, most of whom are from Indonesia. Despite warning signs on all levels not to touch anything, the regular transmission of warnings over loudspeakers and the presence of guards, vandalism on reliefs and statues is a common occurrence and problem, leading to further deterioration. As of 2009, there is no system in place to limit the number of visitors allowed per day or to introduce mandatory guided tours only.[45]\n\nIn August 2014, the Conservation Authority of Borobudur reported some severe abrasion of the stone stairs caused by the scraping of visitors\' footwear. The conservation authority planned to install wooden stairs to cover and protect the original stone stairs, just like those installed in Angkor Wat.[46]\n\nBorobudur was heavily affected by the eruption of Mount Merapi in October and November 2010. Volcanic ash from Merapi fell on the temple complex, which is approximately 28 kilometres (17mi) west-southwest of the crater. A layer of ash up to 2.5 centimetres (1in)[47] thick fell on the temple statues during the eruption of 35 November, also killing nearby vegetation, with experts fearing that the acidic ash might damage the historic site. The temple complex was closed from 5 to 9 November to clean up the ashfall.[48][49]\n\nUNESCO donated US$3 million as a part of the costs towards the rehabilitation of Borobudur after Mount Merapi\'s 2010 eruption.[50] More than 55,000 stone blocks comprising the temple\'s structure were dismantled to restore the drainage system, which had been clogged by slurry after the rain. The restoration was finished in November.[51]\n\nIn January 2012, two German stone-conservation experts spent ten days at the site analyzing the temples and making recommendations to ensure their long-term preservation.[52] In June, Germany agreed to contribute $130,000 to UNESCO for the second phase of rehabilitation, in which six experts in stone conservation, microbiology, structural engineering and chemical engineering would spend a week in Borobudur in June, then return for another visit in September or October. These missions would launch the preservation activities recommended in the January report and would include capacity building activities to enhance the preservation capabilities of governmental staff and young conservation experts.[53]\n\nOn 14 February 2014, major tourist attractions in Yogyakarta and Central Java, including Borobudur, Prambanan and Ratu Boko, were closed to visitors, after being severely affected by the volcanic ash from the eruption of Kelud volcano in East Java, located around 200 kilometers east from Yogyakarta. Workers covered the iconic stupas and statues of Borobudur temple to protect the structure from volcanic ash. The Kelud volcano erupted on 13 February 2014 with an explosion heard as far away as Yogyakarta.[54]\n\nOn 21 January 1985, nine stupas were badly damaged by nine bombs.[55][56] In 1991, a blind Muslim preacher, Husein Ali Al Habsyie, was sentenced to life imprisonment for masterminding a series of bombings in the mid-1980s, including the temple attack.[57] Two other members of the Islamic extremist group that carried out the bombings were each sentenced to 20 years in 1986, and another man received a 13-year prison term.\n\nOn 27 May 2006, an earthquake of 6.2 magnitude struck the south coast of Central Java. The event caused severe damage around the region and casualties to the nearby city of Yogyakarta, but Borobudur remained intact.[58]\n\nIn August 2014, Indonesian police and security forces tightened the security in and around Borobudur temple compound, as a precaution to a threat posted in the social media by a self-proclaimed Indonesian branch of ISIS, citing that the terrorists planned to destroy Borobudur and other statues project in Indonesia.[59] The security improvements included the repair and increased deployment of CCTV monitors and the implementation of a night patrol in and around the temple compound. The jihadist group follows a strict interpretation of Islam that condemns any anthropomorphic representations such as sculptures as idolatry.\n\nThe high volume of visitors ascending the Borobudur\'s narrow stairs, has caused a severe wear out on the stone of the stairs, eroding the stones surface and made them thinner and smoother. Overall, Borobudur has 2,033 surfaces of stone stairs, spread over four cardinal directions; including the west side, the east, south and north. There are around 1,028 surfaces of them, or about 49.15 percent are severely worn out.[60]\n\nTo avoid further wear of stairs\' stones, since November 2014, two main sections of Borobudur stairs  the eastern (ascending route) and northern (descending route) sides  are covered with wooden structures. The similar technique has been applied in Angkor Wat in Cambodia and Egyptian Pyramids.[60] In March 2015, Borobudur Conservation Center proposed further to seal the stairs with rubber cover.[61] Proposals have also been made that visitors be issued special sandals.[62]\n\nThe archaeological excavation into Borobudur during reconstruction suggests that adherents of Hinduism or a pre-Indic faith had already begun to erect a large structure on Borobudur\'s hill before the site was appropriated by Buddhists. The foundations are unlike any Hindu or Buddhist shrine structures, and therefore, the initial structure is considered more indigenous Javanese than Hindu or Buddhist.[63]\n\nBorobudur is built as a single large stupa and, when viewed from above, takes the form of a giant tantric Buddhist mandala, simultaneously representing the Buddhist cosmology and the nature of mind.[64] The original foundation is a square, approximately 118 metres (387ft) on each side. It has nine platforms, of which the lower six are square and the upper three are circular.[65] The upper platform features seventy-two small stupas surrounding one large central stupa. Each stupa is bell-shaped and pierced by numerous decorative openings. Statues of the Buddha sit inside the pierced enclosures.\n\nThe design of Borobudur took the form of a step pyramid. Previously, the prehistoric Austronesian megalithic culture in Indonesia had constructed several earth mounds and stone step pyramid structures called punden berundak as discovered in Pangguyangan, Cisolok and Gunung Padang, West Java. The construction of stone pyramids is based on native beliefs that mountains and high places are the abode of ancestral spirits or hyangs. The punden berundak step pyramid is the basic design in Borobudur, believed to be the continuation of older megalithic tradition incorporated with Mahayana Buddhist ideas and symbolism.[66]\n\nThe monument\'s three divisions symbolize the three \"realms\" of Buddhist cosmology, namely Kamadhatu (the world of desires), Rupadhatu (the world of forms), and finally Arupadhatu (the formless world). Ordinary sentient beings live out their lives on the lowest level, the realm of desire. Those who have burnt out all desire for continued existence leave the world of desire and live in the world on the level of form alone: they see forms but are not drawn to them. Finally, full Buddhas go beyond even form and experience reality at its purest, most fundamental level, the formless ocean of nirvana.[67] The liberation from the cycle of Sasra where the enlightened soul had no longer attached to worldly form corresponds to the concept of nyat, the complete voidness or the nonexistence of the self. Kmadhtu is represented by the base, Rupadhatu by the five square platforms (the body), and Arupadhatu by the three circular platforms and the large topmost stupa. The architectural features between the three stages have metaphorical differences. For instance, square and detailed decorations in the Rupadhatu disappear into plain circular platforms in the Arupadhatu to represent how the world of formswhere men are still attached with forms and nameschanges into the world of the formless.[68]\n\nCongregational worship in Borobudur is performed in a walking pilgrimage. Pilgrims are guided by the system of staircases and corridors ascending to the top platform. Each platform represents one stage of enlightenment. The path that guides pilgrims was designed to symbolize Buddhist cosmology.[69]\n\nIn 1885, a hidden structure under the base was accidentally discovered.[35] The \"hidden footing\" contains reliefs, 160 of which are narratives describing the real Kmadhtu. The remaining reliefs are panels with short inscriptions that apparently provide instructions for the sculptors, illustrating the scenes to be carved.[70] The real base is hidden by an encasement base, the purpose of which remains a mystery. It was first thought that the real base had to be covered to prevent a disastrous subsidence of the monument into the hill.[70] There is another theory that the encasement base was added because the original hidden footing was incorrectly designed, according to Vastu Shastra, the Indian ancient book about architecture and town planning.[35] Regardless of why it was commissioned, the encasement base was built with detailed and meticulous design and with aesthetic and religious consideration.\n\nApproximately 55,000 cubic metres (72,000cuyd) of andesite stones were taken from neighbouring stone quarries to build the monument.[71] The stone was cut to size, transported to the site and laid without mortar. Knobs, indentations and dovetails were used to form joints between stones. The roof of stupas, niches and arched gateways were constructed in corbelling method. Reliefs were created in situ after the building had been completed.\n\nThe monument is equipped with a good drainage system to cater to the area\'s high stormwater run-off. To prevent flooding, 100 spouts are installed at each corner, each with a unique carved gargoyle in the shape of a giant or makara.\n\nBorobudur differs markedly from the general design of other structures built for this purpose. Instead of being built on a flat surface, Borobudur is built on a natural hill. However, construction technique is similar to other temples in Java. Without the inner spaces seen in other temples, and with a general design similar to the shape of pyramid, Borobudur was first thought more likely to have served as a stupa, instead of a temple.[71] A stupa is intended as a shrine for the Buddha. Sometimes stupas were built only as devotional symbols of Buddhism. A temple, on the other hand, is used as a house of worship. The meticulous complexity of the monument\'s design suggests that Borobudur is in fact a temple.\n\nLittle is known about Gunadharma, the architect of the complex.[72] His name is recounted from Javanese folk tales rather than from written inscriptions.\n\nThe basic unit of measurement used during construction was the tala, defined as the length of a human face from the forehead\'s hairline to the tip of the chin or the distance from the tip of the thumb to the tip of the middle finger when both fingers are stretched at their maximum distance.[73] The unit is thus relative from one individual to the next, but the monument has exact measurements. A survey conducted in 1977 revealed frequent findings of a ratio of 4:6:9 around the monument. The architect had used the formula to lay out the precise dimensions of the fractal and self-similar geometry in Borobudur\'s design.[73][74] This ratio is also found in the designs of Pawon and Mendut, nearby Buddhist temples. Archeologists have conjectured that the 4:6:9 ratio and the tala have calendrical, astronomical and cosmological significance, as is the case with the temple of Angkor Wat in Cambodia.[72]\n\nThe main structure can be divided into three components: base, body, and top.[72] The base is 123m 123m (404ft 404ft) in size with 4 metres (13ft) walls.[71] The body is composed of five square platforms, each of diminishing height. The first terrace is set back 7 metres (23ft) from the edge of the base. Each subsequent terrace is set back 2 metres (6.6ft), leaving a narrow corridor at each stage. The top consists of three circular platforms, with each stage supporting a row of perforated stupas, arranged in concentric circles. There is one main dome at the center, the top of which is the highest point of the monument, 35 metres (115ft) above ground level. Stairways at the center of each of the four sides give access to the top, with a number of arched gates overlooked by 32 lion statues. The gates are adorned with Kala\'s head carved on top of each and Makaras projecting from each side. This Kala-Makara motif is commonly found on the gates of Javanese temples. The main entrance is on the eastern side, the location of the first narrative reliefs. Stairways on the slopes of the hill also link the monument to the low-lying plain.\n\nBorobudur is constructed in such a way that it reveals various levels of terraces, showing intricate architecture that goes from being heavily ornamented with bas-reliefs to being plain in Arupadhatu circular terraces.[75] The first four terrace walls are showcases for bas-relief sculptures. These are exquisite, considered to be the most elegant and graceful in the ancient Buddhist world.[76]\n\nThe bas-reliefs in Borobudur depicted many scenes of daily life in 8th-century ancient Java, from the courtly palace life, hermit in the forest, to those of commoners in the village. It also depicted temple, marketplace, various flora and fauna, and also native vernacular architecture. People depicted here are the images of king, queen, princes, noblemen, courtier, soldier, servant, commoners, priest and hermit. The reliefs also depicted mythical spiritual beings in Buddhist beliefs such as asuras, gods, boddhisattvas, kinnaras, gandharvas and apsaras. The images depicted on bas-relief often served as reference for historians to research for certain subjects, such as the study of architecture, weaponry, economy, fashion, and also mode of transportation of 8th-century Maritime Southeast Asia. One of the famous renderings of an 8th-century Southeast Asian double outrigger ship is Borobudur Ship.[77] Today, the actual-size replica of Borobudur Ship that had sailed from Indonesia to Africa in 2004 is displayed in the Samudra Raksa Museum, located a few hundred meters north of Borobudur.[78]\n\nThe Borobudur reliefs also pay close attention to Indian aesthetic discipline, such as pose and gesture that contain certain meanings and aesthetic value. The reliefs of noblemen, and noble women, kings, or divine beings such as apsaras, taras and boddhisattvas are usually portrayed in tribhanga pose, the three-bend pose on neck, hips, and knee, with one leg resting and one upholding the body weight. This position is considered as the most graceful pose, such as the figure of Surasundari holding a lotus.[79]\n\nDuring Borobudur excavation, archeologists discovered colour pigments of blue, red, green, black, as well as bits of gold foil, and concluded that the monument that we see today  a dark gray mass of volcanic stone, lacking in colour  was probably once coated with varjalepa white plaster and then painted with bright colors, serving perhaps as a beacon of Buddhist teaching.[80] The same vajralepa plaster can also be found in Sari, Kalasan and Sewu temples. It is likely that the bas-reliefs of Borobudur was originally quite colourful, before centuries of torrential tropical rainfalls peeled-off the colour pigments.\n\nBorobudur contains approximately 2,670 individual bas reliefs (1,460 narrative and 1,212 decorative panels), which cover the faades and balustrades. The total relief surface is 2,500 square metres (27,000sqft), and they are distributed at the hidden foot (Kmadhtu) and the five square platforms (Rupadhatu).[81]\n\nThe narrative panels, which tell the story of Sudhana and Manohara,[82] are grouped into 11 series that encircle the monument with a total length of 3,000 metres (9,800ft). The hidden foot contains the first series with 160 narrative panels, and the remaining 10 series are distributed throughout walls and balustrades in four galleries starting from the eastern entrance stairway to the left. Narrative panels on the wall read from right to left, while those on the balustrade read from left to right. This conforms with pradaksina, the ritual of circumambulation performed by pilgrims who move in a clockwise direction while keeping the sanctuary to their right.[83]\n\nThe hidden foot depicts the workings of karmic law. The walls of the first gallery have two superimposed series of reliefs; each consists of 120 panels. The upper part depicts the biography of the Buddha, while the lower part of the wall and also the balustrades in the first and the second galleries tell the story of the Buddha\'s former lives.[81] The remaining panels are devoted to Sudhana\'s further wandering about his search, terminated by his attainment of the Perfect Wisdom.\n\nThe 160 hidden panels do not form a continuous story, but each panel provides one complete illustration of cause and effect.[81] There are depictions of blameworthy activities, from gossip to murder, with their corresponding punishments. There are also praiseworthy activities, that include charity and pilgrimage to sanctuaries, and their subsequent rewards. The pains of hell and the pleasure of heaven are also illustrated. There are scenes of daily life, complete with the full panorama of samsara (the endless cycle of birth and death). The encasement base of the Borobudur temple was dissembled to reveal the hidden foot, and the reliefs were photographed by Casijan Chepas in 1890. It is these photographs that are displayed in Borobudur Museum (Karmawibhangga Museum), located just several hundred meters north of the temple. During the restoration, the foot encasement was reinstalled, covering the Karmawibhangga reliefs. Today, only the southeast corner of the hidden foot is revealed and visible for visitors.\n\nThe story starts with the descent of the Lord Buddha from the Tushita heaven and ends with his first sermon in the Deer Park near Benares.[83] The relief shows the birth of the Buddha as Prince Siddhartha, son of King Suddhodana and Queen Maya of Kapilavastu (in present-day Nepal).\n\nThe story is preceded by 27 panels showing various preparations, in the heavens and on the earth, to welcome the final incarnation of the Bodhisattva.[83] Before descending from Tushita heaven, the Bodhisattva entrusted his crown to his successor, the future Buddha Maitreya. He descended on earth in the shape of white elephants with six tusks, penetrated to Queen Maya\'s right womb. Queen Maya had a dream of this event, which was interpreted that his son would become either a sovereign or a Buddha.\n\nWhile Queen Maya felt that it was the time to give birth, she went to the Lumbini park outside the Kapilavastu city. She stood under a plaksa tree, holding one branch with her right hand, and she gave birth to a son, Prince Siddhartha. The story on the panels continues until the prince becomes the Buddha.\n\nJatakas are stories about the Buddha before he was born as Prince Siddhartha.[84] They are the stories that tell about the previous lives of the Buddha, in both human and animal form. The future Buddha may appear in them as a king, an outcast, a god, an elephantbut, in whatever form, he exhibits some virtue that the tale thereby inculcates.[85] Avadanas are similar to jatakas, but the main figure is not the Bodhisattva himself. The saintly deeds in avadanas are attributed to other legendary persons. Jatakas and avadanas are treated in one and the same series in the reliefs of Borobudur.\n\nThe first twenty lower panels in the first gallery on the wall depict the Sudhanakumaravadana, or the saintly deeds of Sudhana. The first 135 upper panels in the same gallery on the balustrades are devoted to the 34 legends of the Jatakamala.[86] The remaining 237 panels depict stories from other sources, as do the lower series and panels in the second gallery. Some jatakas are depicted twice, for example the story of King Sibhi (Rama\'s forefather).\n\nGandavyuha is the story told in the final chapter of the Avatamsaka Sutra about Sudhana\'s tireless wandering in search of the Highest Perfect Wisdom. It covers two galleries (third and fourth) and also half of the second gallery, comprising in total of 460 panels.[87] The principal figure of the story, the youth Sudhana, son of an extremely rich merchant, appears on the 16th panel. The preceding 15 panels form a prologue to the story of the miracles during Buddha\'s samadhi in the Garden of Jeta at Sravasti.\n\nDuring his search, Sudhana visited no fewer than thirty teachers, but none of them had satisfied him completely. He was then instructed by Manjusri to meet the monk Megasri, where he was given the first doctrine. As his journey continues, Sudhana meets (in the following order) Supratisthita, the physician Megha (Spirit of Knowledge), the banker Muktaka, the monk Saradhvaja, the upasika Asa (Spirit of Supreme Enlightenment), Bhismottaranirghosa, the Brahmin Jayosmayatna, Princess Maitrayani, the monk Sudarsana, a boy called Indriyesvara, the upasika Prabhuta, the banker Ratnachuda, King Anala, the god Siva Mahadeva, Queen Maya, Bodhisattva Maitreya and then back to Manjusri. Each meeting has given Sudhana a specific doctrine, knowledge and wisdom. These meetings are shown in the third gallery.\n\nAfter the last meeting with Manjusri, Sudhana went to the residence of Bodhisattva Samantabhadra, depicted in the fourth gallery. The entire series of the fourth gallery is devoted to the teaching of Samantabhadra. The narrative panels finally end with Sudhana\'s achievement of the Supreme Knowledge and the Ultimate Truth.[88]\n\nApart from the story of the Buddhist cosmology carved in stone, Borobudur has many statues of various Buddhas. The cross-legged statues are seated in a lotus position and distributed on the five square platforms (the Rupadhatu level), as well as on the top platform (the Arupadhatu level).\n\nThe Buddha statues are in niches at the Rupadhatu level, arranged in rows on the outer sides of the balustrades, the number of statues decreasing as platforms progressively diminish to the upper level. The first balustrades have 104 niches, the second 104, the third 88, the fourth 72 and the fifth 64. In total, there are 432 Buddha statues at the Rupadhatu level.[4] At the Arupadhatu level (or the three circular platforms), Buddha statues are placed inside perforated stupas. The first circular platform has 32 stupas, the second 24 and the third 16, which adds up to 72 stupas.[4] Of the original 504 Buddha statues, over 300 are damaged (mostly headless), and 43 are missing. Since the monument\'s discovery, heads have been acquired as collector\'s items, mostly by Western museums.[89] Some of these Buddha heads are now displayed in numbers of museums, such as the Tropenmuseum in Amsterdam and The British Museum in London.[90]\n\nAt first glance, all the Buddha statues appear similar, but there is a subtle difference between them in the mudras, or the position of the hands. There are five groups of mudra: North, East, South, West and Zenith, which represent the five cardinal compass points according to Mahayana. The first four balustrades have the first four mudras: North, East, South and West, of which the Buddha statues that face one compass direction have the corresponding mudra. Buddha statues at the fifth balustrades and inside the 72 stupas on the top platform have the same mudra: Zenith. Each mudra represents one of the Five Dhyani Buddhas; each has its own symbolism.[91]\n\nFollowing the order of Pradakshina (clockwise circumumbulation) starting from the East, the mudras of the Borobudur buddha statues are:\n\nThe aesthetic and technical mastery of Borobudur, and also its sheer size, has evoked the sense of grandeur and pride for Indonesians. Just like Angkor Wat for Cambodian, Borobudur has become a powerful symbol for Indonesia  to testify for its past greatness. Sukarno made a point of showing the site to foreign dignitaries. The Suharto regime  realized its important symbolic and economic meanings  diligently embarked on a massive project to restore the monument with the help from UNESCO. Many museums in Indonesia contain a scale model replica of Borobudur. The monument has become almost an icon, grouped with the wayang puppet play and gamelan music into a vague classical Javanese past from which Indonesians are to draw inspiration.[92]\n\nSeveral archaeological relics taken from Borobudur or its replica have been displayed in some museums in Indonesia and abroad. Other than Karmawibhangga Museum within Borobudur temple ground, some museums boast to host relics of Borobudur, such as Indonesian National Museum in Jakarta, Tropenmuseum in Amsterdam, British Museum in London, and Thai National Museum in Bangkok. Louvre museum in Paris, Malaysian National Museum in Kuala Lumpur, and Museum of World Religions in Taipei also displayed the replica of Borobudur.[80] The monument has drawn global attention to the classical Buddhist civilization of ancient Java.\n\nThe rediscovery and reconstruction of Borobudur has been hailed by Indonesian Buddhist as the sign of the Buddhist revival in Indonesia. In 1934, Narada Thera, a missionary monk from Sri Lanka, visited Indonesia for the first time as part of his journey to spread the Dharma in Southeast Asia. This opportunity was used by a few local Buddhists to revive Buddhism in Indonesia. A bodhi tree planting ceremony was held in Southeastern side of Borobudur on 10 March 1934 under the blessing of Narada Thera, and some Upasakas were ordained as monks.[93] Once a year, thousands of Buddhist from Indonesia and neighboring countries flock to Borobudur to commemorate national Vesak ceremony.[94]\n\nThe emblem of Central Java province and Magelang Regency bears the image of Borobudur. It has become the symbol of Central Java, and also Indonesia on a wider scale. Borobudur has become the name of several establishments, such as Borobudur University, Borobudur Hotel in Central Jakarta, and several Indonesian restaurants abroad. Borobudur has been featured in Rupiah banknote, stamps, numbers of books, publications, documentaries and Indonesian tourism promotion materials. The monument has become one of the main tourism attraction in Indonesia, vital for generating local economy in the region surrounding the temple. The tourism sector of the city of Yogyakarta for example, flourish partly because of its proximity to Borobudur and Prambanan temples.','2017-03-25 03:51:14'),(648,84,'c620f8c89d92e66c40558848b8b7c6bf1dbe5da0be2ffe8bbf8af08fa05d924f','8ae67037de62482c9fadfdae17a90647','','','Yogyakarta despite the official spelling, the name is usually pronounced and not uncommonly written Jogjakarta or just Jogja (JOGH-jah)  is a major tourist destination in Indonesia. It\'s the capital city of Yogyakarta Special Region which is in the southern part of the Central Java province, Indonesia.\n\nYogyakarta is a bustling town of some half a million people and the most popular tourist destination on Java, largely thanks to its proximity to the temples of Borobudur and Prambanan. The town is a hub of art and education, offers some good shopping and has a wide range of tourist facilities.\n\nStrictly speaking, the city (kota) of Yogyakarta is only one of five districts within the semi-autonomous region of Daerah Istimewa Yogyakarta (DIY), literally the \"Yogyakarta Special Region\". (The other districts are Sleman on the slopes of fiery Mount Merapi to the North, Bantul all the way to the sea to the South, the hills of Gunungkidul to the East and the low lands of Kulon Progo to the West.) This special status is thanks to the Sultanate of Hamengkubuwono, which has ruled the area since 1755 and steered the state through difficult times of occupation and revolution. During the Indonesian war of independence, Sultan Hamengkubuwono IX offered the fledgling Indonesian government his enclave as capital city, thus Yogyakarta became the revolutionary capital city of the republic from 1946 to 1949 when Jakarta was still occupied by the Dutch. As a result, the central government recognized the Sultan of Yogyakarta as the appointed governor of Yogyakarta Special Region; the only one in Indonesia that is not elected directly by the people. The Indonesian central government has tried to weaken the sultan\'s power by calling for direct election for the governor, however the present Sultan Hamengkubuwono X was chosen by an overwhelming majority.\n\nAlas, Yogyakarta lies in one of the most seismically active parts of Java and has thus repeatedly been struck by earthquakes and volcano eruptions. The worst in recent times was the earthquake of 27 May 2006, which killed over 6,000 people and flattened over 300,000 houses. However, the epicentre was 25km north of the city, which thus avoided the worst of the quake, and a surprisingly effective disaster recovery effort saw most of the physical damage repaired quite quickly.\n\nOnly four years later, in October 2010, the nearby volcano of Mount Merapi erupted, spewing lava over nearby villages, Cangkringan and killing 353 people. After rumbling on and off for two months, the volcano quieted down by December 2010.\n\nYogyakarta\'s Adisucipto International Airport (IATA: JOG), 8km east of town, is a small but busy mostly-domestic hub. There are frequent (every two hour) connections on Garuda, the national airline, to Jakarta (50 minutes) and 2-3 times a day (60min) to Denpasar, while other domestic airlines service both Jakarta and Denpasar, as well as major cities in Java, Sumatra, Kalimantan and Sulawesi. For international services, AirAsia connects Yogyakarta to both Kuala Lumpur and Singapore. Silkair and Tigerair also flies from Singapore.\n\nThere is a tourist information desk, ATM and taxi stand in the arrival hall. Official airport taxis are available for around IDR50,000 depending on your destination, pay at the taxi desk in arrival terminal and then head for the official taxi rank. Give the receipt to your driver, there is no need for any additional payment. It is about half the price to use a taxi dropping passengers off at the departure terminal - insist on using the meter, do expect to pay the IDR2,000 airport entrance fee, even though this has already been paid by the previous passenger on the way in. A departure tax of IDR35,000 (as of Jan 2011) is charged for domestic flights and IDR100,000 for international flights (Feb 2014), at least for international AirAsia flight there is no departure tax anymore (is included in the ticket price, Jun 2015).\n\nThere is a travel agent at the arrival hall in the airport called Arga Tour or other tour services in Yogyakarta like the competitive one Java Bali Trips. A 10-hours car hire inclusive of driver to Prambanan, Ratu Boko, lunch followed by a 2-hour drive to Borobudur cost around IDR500,000-IDR600,000. Good service and English speaking driver. Be sure to haggle, though the price will not drop much, any savings could go toward a more luxurious meal.\n\nYogyakarta airport is one of the two rail-connected airport in Indonesia, beside Kuala Namu in Medan, North Sumatera. Those arriving from (and departing into) the airport can take a Prambanan Ekspres regional train to/from Kutoarjo (west of Yogyakarta), Palur (just east of Surakarta) and several stations in between, including Tugu (just off Malioboro Street in Yogyakarta) and Solobalapan station at Solo. The station at the airport is just a few minutes walk from the terminal, with an air-conditioned underpass leading all the way to the platform for trains into Yogyakarta.\n\nThe main bus station is Giwangan, 4km to the southeast of the centre. There are regular services throughout the island, including Jakarta (12 hours), Bandung (10 hours), and Surabaya (8 hours).\n\nThere is also a bus station inside the airport which is part of the Trans Jogja Busway System. From there you can get to any one of the many bus stations in their system. It costs IDR3,000 for a ticket.\n\nIf you are going north, to Borobudur temple or Semarang for example, head to Jombor terminal located just above the northern Ringroad. Expect to be ripped off on any bus to Borobudur, the going rate for westerners is IDR15,000-25,000 (local IDR7,000).\n\nIf you are planning to come to Yogyakarta from Bandung then you need to go to Cicaheum Terminal in Bandung to get bus. If direct bus is not available then take bus to Purwokerto (6-7h, IDR45,000). From Purwokerto there are regular buses available for Yogyakarta (4-5h, IDR30,000). Direct bus Bandung - Yogyakarta is available 24/7, both regular (every hour) or night bus that depart at 15:00 from Bandung.\n\nSince Yogyakarta is in close proximity to Semarang and Solo, there\'s also a shuttle bus that operates between these cities, called Joglosemar (Jogja-Solo-Semarang), IDR45,000 to Semarang, and IDR25,000 to Solo\n\nwho operates 5 seaters and 7 seaters private car,for tour packages and price see in their sites\n\nTrains to Jakarta take between 7-12h from the main Yogyakarta station, commonly called Tugu Station. The Argo-class trains (Argo Lawu and Argo Dwipangga) are the best of the lot being the most comfortable and fastest (c. 7.5 hours, IDR380,000 (May 2016) plus mineral water and snacks). Taksaka is almost as good at Rp 235,000-265,000. These express services connect Yogyakarta and Jakarta in 7-8 hours, either at daytime or overnight. Price and schedules are available online. The line between Kroya and Prupuk, where the railway crosses the main backbone mountains of Java, is scenic.\n\nPassengers to/from Bandung should take the Argo Wilis or Lodaya expresses which traverse a scenic part of Java during daylight hours, with rice fields and mountains (although there is an overnight Lodaya and the Turangga from Surabaya also travels overnight. The fare is IDR155,000 including mineral water and food (or more like snacks).\n\nPassengers to Surabaya are served by the twice-daily Sancaka service departing in the morning and afternoon.\n\nYogyakarta and Solo are connected by several Prambanan Ekspres trains. Despite the name, the train does not stop at Prambanan station, and even if it does make an unscheduled stop, the station is rather far from the temple complex of Prambanan. The Prambanan Ekspres does stop at Maguwo station (for the airport) making it easy for travellers to change modes.\n\nYogyakarta is immediately accessible by car. Jalur Selatan (i.e South Line), which stretches through the southern part of Java (practically from Bandung to Surabaya) passes through Yogyakarta. The city lies approximately 380 kms east of Bandung and 300 kms southwest of Surabaya.\n\nFrom Jakarta however, through journey via South Line is possible and common, visitors usually prefer traveling through Jalur Pantura (Jalur Pantai Utara, i.e North Coast Line). From Semarang, 110 km away, go south, and you will enter Yogyakata from the north. Traveling through the north cuts the distance by a few tens of kilometers, the roads are wider, and there are more facilities (eateries, accommodations, gas stations) along the way compared to the South Line. However, Jalur Pantura is more crowded since there are plenty of trucks and long distance buses along the way, and particularly in the peak seasons (long holiday), it is usually heavily congested.\n\nWhen arrived in Yogyakarta there are many car rental companies in this city, there are many options of cars that can be rented, mostly are MPVs, city cars, vans and even luxury cars.\n\nYour chauffeur on Java (and Bali) dadangsupardi@indonesiatour.nl https://www.indonesiatour.nl/?lang=en\n\nYogyakarta is a relatively small city, so traveling around town should not be too expensive. If you are on foot, note that a street sign facing you at a corner indicates the name of the street you are entering, not the cross street. The Tourism Authority has maps in English that can be obtained from its offices next to Hotel Mutiara on Jl. Malioboro, at the airport and the train station. Beware that these maps are not to scale. Apart of traveling by yourself independently, there are many tour operators who will offer you an affordable various tour packages. Just find a reliable tour company like Java Bali Trips who is patiently organize your trips based on the budget. Normally, the most basic private tour will cost 450,000 IDR / 12 hours service with a capacity 5 adults passenger maximum.\n\nYogyakarta\'s taxis are metered and nowadays most taxi drivers are trustworthy. Flagfall is IDR6,000 and most trips around the centre of town should not cost more than IDR15,000. After dark the minimum fare for a taxi is IDR20,000 even if the meter reads less that IDR20,000. If by chance you find a taxi driver that you feel comfortable with and trustworthy, ask for his cellular phone number so that next time you need to travel you can call directly to his cell phone and arrange your travel needs. Most taxi drivers will be more than happy to do this. Virtually everyone has a cell phone which is called a \"hp\" (hand phone) throughout Indonesia, and everyone including all adults use text messaging (sms) extensively. It is best to use text messaging to communicate with drivers e.g. \"sudah siap\" when you are \"ready\" to be picked up. \"Tolong jemput saya di Hotel XXXX jam XXXXX\" = Please pick me up at hotel XXXX at XXX o\'clock. Note: \"jam = time\" in Indonesian. Taxi in Yogyakarta could be reserved directly in the airport or every tourism center. Besides, you may also book the taxi from on-line organized by bluetaksi or SayTaxi phone application before you arrive. The booking can be done via [bluetaksi@gmail.com] or download the app from your preferred appstore.\n\nAs other city in Indonesia, motorcycle taxi is one of the most used public transportation here. Indonesian called them \"ojek\", and you can find them in every terminals, station and even airport. It is good to use if you come alone, and the fare is negotionable. However, be careful to get scammed as there is no clear \'normal\' fare even when you ask the locals. A simple ride from the airport to city center should be no more than IDR60,000, and you may able to negotiate it down to IDR 30,000.\n\nThere is an ongoing trend of \"online motorcycle taxi\" in Indonesia, where you can order them through an apps in your smartphone, pick your destination, and see the total fare based on kilometers (which is usually cheaper than \"traditonal ojek\"). It is a good way to avoid scam and time-wasting fare negotiation as you can see how much you need to pay before you order a ride. You can also order a ride from almost anywhere in the city, especially when you are tired of waiting the almost-extinct public bus. This service is run by some company who built up the system and the app, and some part-time driver who get the order through their smartphone. Right now there are two major companies in Yogyakarta, Gojek and UberMotor, and you can get their apps in playstore or appstore for free. Both apps have english mode, so it will be easy to use. The fare varies between companies and always change every couples of months, but it never more than IDR2500/kilometers.\n\nHowever there is still some major drawback from this \"ojek online\". There is an ongoing debate about its legality, as Indoneisan law doesn\'t recognize motorcycle as public transport, so their service can be suddenly stopped anytime in the future. There is also a conflict between \"online ojek\" and \"traditional ojek\" driver, which resulted the banning of \"ojek online\" from taking passanger from some station, airport and terminal. You can still order a ride from that place, but you may need to walk to a couple hundred meters from the gates to meet up with your driver without resulting any conflict (usually, the driver would tell you about it when you order from the conflict area). One more problem: just as other people in Indonesia, these driver may lack of english, so make sure you pick the right location on the apps before ordering a ride.\n\nTraditional three-wheeled and pedal-powered cart, known as becak (pronounced beh-chak), which can be found in most part of Yogyakarta. Haggle furiously before getting into the becak. Be sure to determine whether the price is for a one-way or return (pulang) trip and if you want the driver to wait whilst you conduct your shopping or business. A ride from within the city to the Malioboro shopping precinct should not cost more than IDR10,000.\n\nThere is also an ongoing trend where the motor-powered trishaw started to replacing the man-powered one. Likewise, there is an ongoing debate about its safetiness and legality. The fare might be more expensive, but it is surely faster and covering more areas. However, it is strongly recommended to use the man-powered trishaw to help the driver, as most of them are poor and old.\n\nTraditional horse-pulled carts, known as andong, or dokar, wait for tourists outside hotspots like the train station, the Kraton and Mal Malioboro. Haggle furiously. The traditional route is from Jl. Malioboro to Keraton, and this is where you\'ll find most andong. Usually, andong opt to take you to shop for fake Dagadu t-shirt in Ngasem area with hefty prices. Then, andong will take you back to your initial journey. The cost for one round trip for andong is IDR20,000. Usually they ask for IDR30,000 but they may settle for less. Andong can accommodate up to 5 adult passengers.\n\nMedium and small size buses are the main public transport in Yogyakarta.\n\nThere are two kind of bus: regular and patas. Patas buses, known as TransJogja operate from 6AM to 10PM and stop only at designated shelters. Unlike regular buses, TransJogja is air-conditioned and generally safer. Tickets can be purchased directly at the shelters and cost for single trip is Rp 3,600. Passengers may purchase regular trip cards which cuts per tip cost to Rp 2,700, and allows transit to other shelter. There are six routes, and route maps can be downloaded [10].\n\nBe aware that the bus stops are quite far apart, (1-2kms) and not very numerous, and often the bus stops for opposite directions are not opposite each other. If you are planning on travelling this way, expect to still do a fair amount of walking to and from the stops to your destination. You also need to aware that the bus only operates up to 9 PM.\n\nRegular buses normally operates from 6AM to 5PM, and some long routes extend their operation until 9PM. Please never bring anything valuable on public buses, pickpockets in buses are now more common than ever before. Cost for single trip is Rp 2,500 regardless of distance (within the city). Usually on a bus there will be one driver and one helper who will hang from the side of the bus and handle money and try to get passengers. The helper will usually tap you on the shoulder to indicate you should pay him. If there is no helper you can pay the driver directly. When you are ready to get off a bus, tell the driver or helper \"Kiri,\" which means left. Animated bus route maps are available at Transportation Agency of Yogyakarta website [11].\n\nLikewise, the bus are not very numerous and some of them are almost extinct. You can wait in the roadside for hours and found nothing. Some route may has stop its service completely without any announcement. Be aware that most routes only operate until afternoon (about 4 pm). If this happen, grab your phone and call a taxi or ojek.\n\nThere are several car and motorbike rental agencies just outside Tugu Station near Jalan Pasar Kembang on the street that runs east-west just south of the station.\n\nA near new semi-automatic (clutchless) motorbike can be rented for Rp 50,000 per 24 hr; older bikes may come for less, and fully automatic bikes such as a Honda Vario or Yamaha Mio may sometimes cost Rp 5,000-10,000 more. Long-term discounts are commonly available for weekly (Rp 300,000) and monthly (Rp 700,000) rentals.\n\nCars can be had rented for around Rp 350,000 for 24 hr, or Rp 225,000 for 12 hr. A driver can be hired along with the car for another Rp 50,000-Rp 200,000/day. Prices may vary due to fuel inclusion for a set distance or itinerary. Prices are always subject to negotiation and may increase or decrease due to local demand, type and age of vehicle and your individual requirements at the time. Cars are usually rented with drivers and it is strongly advised for foreigners as the roads are extremely busy with all the hundreds of thousands of higher ed students driving motorcycles recklessly around the city. I think you can get a better price than quoted here. In my experience, driving yourself in Bali is fine but not recommended for cities in Java like Yogya or Jakarta. Price of rental doesn\'t include petrol (gas), parking, entrance fees etc. It is customary to give your driver 15,000 rps during any mealtime stops but he won\'t expect to eat with you.\n\nIf renting a vehicle, please ensure you are familiar with both the applicable licensing requirements and vehicle use in the prevailing conditions.\n\nTo get around in Yogyakarta can be done by a car with driver. Commonly the driver has driving license or STNK in Indonesia language. Some drivers can speak basic English and some cannot. The trained-English speaking drivers could be found along the tourism centre, like in Malioboro, Prawirotaman, Kota Gode etc. This way to travel Yogyakarta for the first time is very helpful and higly recommended. Commonly the driver will transfer and pick up you in the airport or other places in Yogyakarta. Since 2014 Yogyakarta has a trained-English speaking driver community with proficient hospitality and tourism knowledge. This community will help visitors\' tour arrangement, transport, accommodations etc. It is organized by Yogyakarta Kota Istimewa or YOKI.\n\nBeing one of the oldest cities in Indonesia, Yogyakarta has many heritage buildings and monuments. The number one must-see attraction is Sri Sultan Hamengkubuwono\'s palace, better known as Kraton Ngayogyakarta\' or just call it less formally \"Kraton\" or \"Sultan\'s Palace\". Very hard to pronounce Javanese names like Ngayogyakarta....\'. Other heritage buildings from colonial era are: BNI \'46 building, Kantor Pos Besar (Central Post Office) building, and Bank Indonesia building, all of them are located near Sultan\'s palace.\n\nOther notable landmarks and attractions are:\n\n\n\n The Sri Sultan\'s palace or Kraton encompasses the main palace, Sultan\'s residential, two Sultan\'s grounds, and large residential area where sultan servants used to reside. The Kraton is very large, and difficult to navigate by foot (unless you don\'t mind lots of walking). Notable attraction in Kraton complex are:\n\nAlso worth seeing is the prince\'s palace to the SE of the main palace.\n\nTrue to its name in this arena you can find different types of games and attractions Planetariun a new facility that can be enjoyed by visitors and still are an integral part of the Kraton Complex\n\nYogyakarta city was built with deep philosophy: the city was designed so that the main elements of the city forms a imaginary line. This straight line starts from Parangtritis on the coast, to Kraton Yogyakarta, to Tugu Monument, and finally to Mount Merapi. This represents Sultan\'s strong relationship with the guardian spirits of Mt. Merapi and the beach of Parangtritis.\n\nCandi is ancient archeological structure constructed during 7th-9th century aimed for a specific religion (Buddhist or Hindu). It was constructed from hundreds of volcanic or river stone blocks and assembled solely by human labor. Candi walls is often carved with reliefs depicting stories, and a stone God or Goddess statue usually sits at the center.\n\nThere are several candi located in Yogyakarta and it\'s proximity. The two most famous must see ancient temples are both UNESCO official World Heritage Sites. These include Borobudur, an 9th century Buddhist temple 1 hour drive from Yogyakarta in [Magelang]], not far from Yogyakarta. The second, a Hindu temple,Prambanan, also a well-known candi is just 10 minutes drive from Yogya\'s Adi Sucipto airport on the outskirts of the city.\n\nYogyakarta is known as the city of education as well as the city of culture. This title is not without reason: many education institution are located here. Every year, around mid-July, thousands of new students from all over Indonesia flock into this city, converting the once quiet town to a busy yet dynamic city.\n\nMany curious goods are available in many places in this city. If you love timeless pieces, Yogyakarta is the home of batik , traditional wayang puppets, sculpture, ceramics and silverware. Countless handicrafts from outside Yogyakarta can also be found here. Don\'t be surprised if you bump into souvenirs from Bali or Asmat, often with better deal than if bought in those islands. Alternatively, as a constantly growing city, Yogyakarta has several stylish malls and trade centres that offer interesting goods and services at a reasonable cost.\n\nMalioboro is a well-known shopping promenade and very popular among Indonesian as well as international tourists. Spans from the Tugu Station to the Sultan\'s square, Malioboro is 2 km in length and home to hundreds of shops and street-stalls offering various kind of handicrafts.\n\nIf travelling on foot is not your thing, you can ride the pedal-powered trishaw called becak, or the andong horsecart.\n\nWarning: While Yogyakarta is safer than Jakarta, it\'s not free from pickpockets. Most of the time, Malioboro sidewalk is overcrowded. Take standard precautions to protect your belongings.(the last 10 years there is no pick pocket in Malioboro street). Recommended to ask your driver/tour guide to accompany your shopping.\n\nWhile not as populated as Jakarta, Yogyakarta has several trendy malls which shows a glimpse of the alternate side of Yogyakarta culture.\n\nOriginally, Yogyakarta dishes were known for their sweetness. However, as more and more people move to Yogya, this small city starts seeing more diversity in flavor. Now you can find many kind of interesting dishes, ranging from sweet, to spicy, to fiery. Sometimes a fusion from other cuisines such as Chinese or Western can be found. Note that restaurants in the center often close quite early by Western standards, with admission often refused after 9PM.\n\nThe following dishes should be on every traveller\'s agenda:\n\n\n\n Yogyakarta is a heaven of inexpensive foods, and some tasty and filling dishes can be had for as low as US$0.25. There are hundreds, if not thousands of hawker stalls offering inexpensive foods.\n\nYogya is filled with many \'high-end\' restaurants serving many kind of dishes, from western to asian to asian-fusion cuisines.\n\nPlease note usually all clubs willing to give free entry before midnight if you call and ask for a guestlist, unless on an important event night.\n\nLounges/cafes are an evergrowing phenomena throughout Indonesia\'s trendy inner city environments\n\nThere are hundreds of budget hotels in Yogyakarta. Most of them can be found in Sosrowijayan St (Jalan Sastrowijayan on Google Maps) which is adjacent to Malioboro Street and the in Prawirotaman Rd area, which is about 3.5 km to the south of the centre.\n\nLike any other larger Indonesian city, Yogya has its share of petty crime like pickpocketing, especially in local city busses. Watch out for gallery scams and streetsellers trying to get commission for batik. These scams tend to occur around the Kraton and Jl. Malioboro. Scammers will approach tourists and tell them about a government art centre or school with fair prices, and will hire cheap transport or refer you to the \'genuine\' gallery. However there are no official government sponsered galleries. This scam might kill a couple of nice hours when they explain how batik is being made, but in the end you\'re still being manipulated into buying too expensive art.\n\nTake caution when walking by the city. Traffic is very brutal! You might have difficulty crossing roads and streets especially in crowded places.\n\nAlways travel in groups when you are travelling to or from Parangtritis beach. The long stretch between Yogya city and the beach is dangerous at night. You may get stopped by someone riding a motorcycle trying to rob you. Police stations or posts are very few on these roads, and unfortunately the posts are often unoccupied.\n\nWatch out for Tour scams, e.g. \"Bamboo Tours\" on Prawirotaman 2. Tours might not happen with funny excuses given and no upfront information.You might waste your day waiting for a car thats never showing up.\n\nThe international country code for Indonesia is 62. The local area code for Yogyakarta is 274. There are three main telecommunication providers in Indonesia: Telkom Indonesia, Indosat and Excelcomindo. Coin operated public phones are limited in Yogyakarta. However there are many official telephone kiosks called Wartel.\n\nTo make an IDD call from Indonesia, dial the access code 001 (for Indosat) and 007 (for Telkom), followed by the country code, area code and party\'s number.\n\nalso available cheaper IDD call via VoIP Technologies, IDD Prefix is 01016 (for Indosat user) and 01017 (for Wartel, Telkom, and Telkomsel user), and 01000 (for XL -excelcom- user)\n\nMobile Phones are carried by almost everyone in Indonesia. Prepaid SIM cards are widely available from many telecommunication providers, such as, Telkomsel, XL, Indosat, 3, and Axis, just bring your own GSM 900 or GSM 1800 phone. The pre-paid SIM card costs around Rp 10,000 up to Rp 30.000. A local phone call costs between Rp 500-Rp 2,000/minute. Local text message (SMS) costs about Rp 150, while international SMS cost about Rp 300-500.\n\nAlso available for CDMA users, Telkom Flexi, Smartfren, And Esia which are cheaper, but you must have a RUIM CDMA phone.\n\nYogyakarta has three public libraries, including one on Malioboro Street, the main shopping street, where wi-fi is available for free. At the entry, write your name down into the registration book. The Malioboro branch has the wi-fi login details on wall posters; desks, chairs and study rooms are available across two floors of the building.\n\nThere are many internet cafes in Yogyakarta which offer speedy access to the internet. Several hotels provide Wi-Fi on the lobby. Ask the front desk about internet access. The Taman Sari food court at the Plaza Ambarrukmo, coloquially known as Amplas, offers a free wireless internet service for any wifi compatible device.\n\nThe 24 hour Indomaret on Malioboro Street offers free wireless access as well as wall sockets, but can be a little noisy.\n\nMake sure to factor in the astronomical $20 US entry fee for foreign tourists at Borobudur and $18 US at Prambanan before you show up. They of course accept the Indonesian equivalent. If visiting both temples you can buy a \'package\' ticket for both for $30, available at either temple entrance though not advertised on the boards (the websites confirm that the ticket exist though). Free tea/coffe and bottled water included. Tour operators may try to sell you a \'discount package\' including the entrance fees, assuring you it is cheaper than the individual entrance prices, this is true, but they neglect to tell you that the package ticket exists!\n\nIt can work out quite economical if you rent a scooter for 50,000 a day and drive it to Borobudur and Prambanan instead of taking the tours. You\'ll need another 10-15,000 worth of petrol though. The roads to both sites are pretty wide and in good condition. If you leave early in the morning you can make it to Borobudur in a little under 60 mins. It\'s really quick and even cheaper if there are 2 people instead of one.','2017-03-25 03:51:14'),(649,84,'c620f8c89d92e66c40558848b8b7c6bf1dbe5da0be2ffe8bbf8af08fa05d924f','b82f73fbffb1407992c7606e1ed90a14','','','It all started on my first day in Jogja, after a flight that morning from Bali, where I had just spent the past few weeks backpacking. Upon landing in Jogja, I went straight to my hotel  the Ibis Styles Yogyakarta Hotel. I still dont know if they had any part to play in this scam.\n\nOnce I had checked in, I was informed that because it was only around 9am at that time, my room would not be ready until later in the afternoon. This is standard practice in the hotel industry, so I was not too worried about it. Instead, I asked the reception to call me a taxi, as I was about to embark on one of my travel dreams  the chance to experience Candi Borobudur!\n\nMy taxi came within 5 minutes, and I had arranged a return fee of 300,000 Rupiah, which included the driver waiting for me in the car park before we came home. For those of you who do not know, Borobudur is an incredible Buddhist temple but is actually located in Magelang regency, an hours drive from my hotel. However, much likeat Stonehenge in the UK, its in the middle of nowhere, so you must have a taxi/bus trip back home already planned, as you will not see any other random taxis driving past otherwise.\n\nWhen we arrived at Borobudur, I kindly asked the taxi driver to wait for me in the car park, to which he agreed, and I got a good look at his face, car number, and the colour of the car! Even in a busy UNESCO World Heritage Site car park it must be easy to find him a few hours later when I had finishedexploring Borobudur, right?\n\nWhen all was said and done, I think I had spent around 2 hours at Borobudur, and what an amazing time I had! Undoubtedly one of the finest Buddhist temple complexes in the region, and it was delightful that I had ticked off something on my bucket list!\n\nHowever, when I walked back to the car park, my taxi driver was nowhere to be seen.\n\nIt was now early afternoon, and the temperature here in Java was hitting 35 degrees Fahrenheit with near 90% humidity. It was also my first day in Yogyakarta ever, and having flown in at such an ungodly hour from Bali, I was also beginning to get rather tired and exhausted by now.Yet I couldnt find my driver! I walked around the car park for a while, I think I must have circled it around 3 or 4 times, and even walking the outer perimeter, as some taxis were in the corner of the car park sheltering under the trees from the suns rays. Yet still no sign of him.\n\nNow, I am an experienced backpacker so I have had worse than this (my taxi driver in Delhi once threatened to throw all my bags out of the car in the dead of night unless I paid him extra), but I really wasnt in the mood for such things today.\n\nI walked back to the Candi Borobudur Visitors Centre and asked a lady behind the desk if there was a taxi rank here. She said there wasnt. At that point, I began to worry a little. Fortunately, I began speaking to an Indonesian man, roughly middle-aged, who had been hanging around in the Visitors Centre even from a few hours earlier when I had began my tour of Borobudur. After explaining to him my predicament, he got his mobile phone out and promised to help me. He was a really nice man, actually, and I dont know what I would have done without his help.\n\nAnyway, this guy phoned his friend who worked at a nearby hotel and arranged for him to pick me up and drop me back at the Ibis Styles Hotel in Yogyakarta  and he was only going to charge me 200,000 Rupiah! Now, if you remember my original taxi driver wanted 300,000 for the return trip (but I hadnt paid him anything yet), then with this new deal it meant I would get to Borobudur and back for just the 200,000! Result!\n\nHowever, it didnt work out like that.\n\nLater that evening, having just had some simple room service in my hotel room, I received a phone call from reception saying that the taxi driver who had taken me to Borobudur was standing in the lobby and is demanding his payment! Apparently, he was claiming that he had been waiting in the Borobudur car park all day (this must have been 8 or 9 hours since he dropped me off) and was VERY angry.\n\nI tried to tell the receptionist on the phone that he had abandoned me and therefore the deal was off, as I had to pay another driver to take me home because this outbound taxi driver was too unreliable. I am VERY certain he was NOT in the car park. I would have spotted him if he had have been. The receptionist nevertheless reiterated that the driver is DEMANDING payment, at which point I tried to explain that ok, he took me to Borobudur, so I will pay him half of what the return fare was planned to be, which was 300,000 Rupiah. Yet again, the receptionist phoned me back a few minutes later and said that the driver wanted FULL payment. The receptionist also then laughablytold meto come down and speak to him myself. I replied by saying that that wouldnt be a good idea, in case he got aggressive towards me.\n\nHonestly, what kind of receptionist encourages commotion like that in their own hotel lobby?\n\nIn this moment, I instantly smelled SCAM. However, with the possible threat of the Jogja Polisi getting involved (which probably would have meant a night in prison cell for me), I decided that the only way to resolve this was to just pay the guy what he wanted. Yet I made it clear to the receptionist on the phone, that she must send somebody up to collect the money, dont send the taxi driver up! Thankfullythey obliged, and 2 members of the hotel came up and collected my money.\n\nIt was quite lucky I still had that amount left in my wallet, really, wasnt it? What else could I have done, accompany the taxi driver to the ATM and let him watch me withdraw more funds?\n\nAnyway, on a morning when I was happy to be paying 300,000 Rupiah for my journey, and on an afternoon where I was delighted to only seemingly be paying 200,000 Rupiah, it was a sad, sad end to the day for me as I in total ended up paying 500,000 Rupiah for my sins  and I still believe to this day that it was some elaborate scam between some hotel staff and taxi driver. I really would interested to know if anyone else has been affected by an apparent scam like this.\n\nThere is less chance of being scammed if you travel to Borobudur the cheaper way on public bus.\n\nOh, and in case youre wondering, this is what I got up to at Borobudur that day!','2017-03-25 03:51:14'),(650,84,'c620f8c89d92e66c40558848b8b7c6bf1dbe5da0be2ffe8bbf8af08fa05d924f','ad160796fe1546bebb9628a1d9c117e7','','','We noticed that you\'re using an outdated browser.

Fact: Ash Upson, one of the men greatly responsible for the myth of Billy the Kid, gave this date when he wrote majority of Pat Garretts biography The Authentic Life of Billy the Kid and might I add that the November 23rd date happens to be Upson\'s birth date too -coincidence? Billy the Kids exact date of birth and place is not known, and historians and biographers today are still trying to solve the mystery. Birth dates of November 20, 1859 and September 17, 1859 have popped up, but there\'s no proof or even a hint of these dates being accurate. As for where Billy the Kid was born; New York, Indiana, and Missouri are potential birth places, but there is no -without a doubt- proof to support any of them. At the time of his death, it was consistently written that Billy the Kid was born in New York City, so it\'s very possible that it could be true and that the writers of that era knew something we don\'t. Due to the testimonies by the Kids friends and acquaintances, it\'s very possible and most likely that the Kid was born later than 1859, possibly around 1860-62. Childhood friends in Silver City said that he was about 12 years old in 1873, and the Coe cousins would go on to say that the Kid was about 17 years old during the Lincoln County War in early 1878. Lincoln resident, Lily Casey, would also say that the Kid was barely 16 when he was jailed in Lincoln in November of 1877. This would then make him under 21 years old at the time of death. Garrett may have deliberately made the Kid 21 years old to make him an adult man when he shot him, instead of giving the harsh reality of gunning down a kid possibly still in his teens. In the end, it made no difference of age, Garrett was still viewed with suspicion.\n\n  Myth: Billy the Kid had a younger brother named Edward or (another story) he had a older brother named Joseph. Fact: The Kid did not have a younger brother named Edward, but he did have a younger brother named Joseph. It\'s been believed that Joseph was the older brother due to an error on his death certificate when he died in November of 1930, which stated his age as seventy-six, thus making his year of birth 1854. But there\'s more than enough proof that he was born in 1863, making him two-three years younger than Billy the Kid. For more details of this proof click here for The Antrim Family web page.\n\n  Myth: At the age twelve, Billy the Kid killed his first man who had insulted his mother. After the killing, he bid his mother farewell and ran away. Fact: The above is an example of some of the hogwash written about Billy the Kid. First of all, the Kids mother died from consumption a year before he escaped from the Silver City jail and \"ran away.\" Secondly, it wasn\'t because he killed a man, but it was for being an accomplice in the theft of some laundry. The Kid then fled to Arizona and on August 18, 1877 at Fort Grant, he killed his first man. His name was Frank Windy Cahill, a bully who tormented the slender teenager, who may have been about sixteen at the time, on several occasions until the Kid had enough of his abuse. During an argument, the bully rushed the Kid, sat on him and pummeled him in the face, since the Kid knew he was no match for the heavyweight, he shot him. Though it was purely self-defense, the Kid was wanted for murder.\n\n  Myth: As a young boy, Billy the Kid was given a Barlow knife as a gift and he used it to decapitate a neighbor\'s kitten. Fact: Absolutely not! Just a figment of someone\'s twisted imagination -nothing more than anti-Billy the Kid rubbish.\n\n  Myth: Billy the Kid was short, chubby and ugly. Fact: Here is an unbiased statement from a reporter of the Las Vegas Gazette: He is about five feet eight or nine inches tall, slightly built and lithe, weighing about 140; a frank, open countenance, looking like a school boy, with the traditional silky fuzz on his upper lip; clear blue eyes, with a roguish snap about them; light hair and complexion. He is, in all, quite a handsome looking fellow, the only imperfection being two prominent front teeth slightly protruding like squirrels teeth, and he has agreeable and winning ways.Las Vegas Gazette, December 27, 1881 I never liked the picture. I dont think it does Billy justice. Paulita Maxwell on Billy the Kids only authentic photograph. So if Billy the Kid was as butt-ugly as some say, why did he have so many female admirers and every description said about him (whether by man or woman) all say he was a \"fine looking lad\" or \"handsome with boyish good looks.\" As historian Drew Gomber, of the Hubbard Museum, once said, \"We shouldn\'t judge him by that photo of him, because everyone who knew him said it was a bad photo and it\'s essentially like judging someone by their driver\'s license photo.\"\n\n  Fact: He was ambidextrous, but primarily right-handed. Due to the reverse image of the only known photograph of Billy the Kid, it gave the incorrect impression that he was left-handed because his revolver is positioned on the left side. Someone finally realized the imaged was flipped by looking at the Winchester rifle.\n\n  Myth: Billy the Kid had a hair-trigger temper, which could explode with the slightest provocation. Fact: Everyone who came in contact with the Kid, either friend, foe or a reporter, all agree that the Kid had an easygoing personality, a wonderful sense of humor, and was always in good spirits, despite any situation, whether it be bad or good. He was credited for never losing his composure and having a cool head under the most desperate of circumstances. So those characteristics don\'t exactly go hand in hand with a bad-temper. For example, if the Kid did have a short fuse that could erupt by the slightest provocation, how come then during his confinement he was able to control himself calmly against Deputy Bob Olingers constant taunting and verbal abuse? Miguel Antonio Otero Jr., a friend and admirer of the Kid, wrote in his biography The Real Billy the Kid, concerning this legendary trait: I have been told that Billy had an ungovernable temper; however, I never saw evidences of it. He was always in a pleasant humor when I saw him-laughing, sprightly, and good natured. In his biography, The Authentic Life of Billy the Kid, Pat Garrett gave the Kid a bad temper to make him more dangerous, so readers would think Garrett more heroic for going after such a dangerous outlaw. Of course, dime novelists ran with this idea, and therefore created the myth.\n\n  Myth: Billy the Kid was illiterate and had no schooling. Fact: Though he probably had little schooling, the Kid was not illiterate. As a youngster he was an avid reader of books and dime novels. Not only could he read and write, but he also had artistic and legible handwriting.Judging from the letters he wrote to Governor Wallace, they were articulate and almost error free. \n\n . Myth: Jessie Evans and Billy the Kid were childhood friends. Fact: Jessie Evans was older than the Kid by seven years, so the idea of them playing hide and seek together as children in Silver City isnt likely. Jesse Evans was under the employment of John Chisum at the time when the Kid was still attending grammar school. The Kid wouldnt meet Evans and join his gang until October of 1877.\n\n  Myth: Billy the Kids employer John Tunstall was a father figure who took the Kid under his wing. Fact: A bit of an exaggeration. John Tunstall was 24 years old when he was murdered, hardly the age of a father figure. The Tunstall/Bonney relationship wasnt as close as movies portrayed, to Tunstall, the Kid was simply just another ranch hand and in his letters to his parents in England, Tunstall would name off a few of his employees, like Dick Brewer, but never once did he mentioned the Kid. The Kid did respect Tunstall, but he bonded more with the other employees such as Fred Waite, Charlie Bowdre, George and Frank Coe, and Tom O\'Folliard. They become more like brothers to him, then Tunstall.\n\n  Fact: The Kid did rustle some cattle with a few of his friends, mostly from John Chisum\'s herd, but he was not a large scale rustler or leader of a large organized gang. Instead the Kid\'s reputation as a rustler was grossly exaggerated by the news press. The true title holders of \"large scale\" rustlers go to John Kinney and Jessie Evans. To learn more about Billy the Kid\'s criminal activities, read an archive article I wrote \"Billy the Kid: How bad was he?\" \n\n  Myth: There were wanted posters on Billy the Kid. Fact: There were never any Wanted posters on Billy the Kid. The closest thing to a wanted poster was a reward notice the governor put in the Las Vegas Gazette in December of 1880. Which read: BILLY THE KID\n\n $500 Reward\n\n I will pay $500 reward to any person or persons\n\n who will capture William Bonny, alias The Kid, and\n\n deliver him to any sheriff of New Mexico.\n\n Satisfactory proofs of identity will be required.\n\n \n\n (No that\'s not a typo error, Bonney was indeed spelled incorrectly) So the poster which some of you may have seen which describes Billy the Kid as being 5\' 3\'\' 120lbs with a posted reward for $5,000 dollars to be delivered to Sheriff James Dalton, is not only inaccurate, but never existed. There is also a funeral notice poster which is also a fake. Both are nothing more than souvenirs.\n\n  Myth: Billy the Kid shot a man for snoring too loud at a hotel. Fact: This myth belongs to John Wesley Hardin not Billy the Kid, and even still, it\'s not true. Unfortunately, some folks confuse the ruthless Hardin with the easy-going Billy the Kid. These two gunfighters couldn\'t have been more different; Hardin far outshone the Kid when it came to killing.\n\n  Myth: At one time Billy the Kid rode with Jesse James. Fact: Billy the Kid never rode with Jesse James. There is indeed a story that the Kid met Jesse James who was going under the alias of Thomas Howard at a restaurant in Las Vegas, New Mexico. Supposedly they ate together and chatted, and during that meeting Jesse invited the Kid to join his gang in which the Kid flatly refused. Robbing banks and trains did not interest him. Rustling cattle was one thing, but armed robbery was entirely another! Therefore, the myth of Billy the Kid being a member of the James gang at one time is absolutely false. \n\n  Myth: Billy the Kid would drink to the extreme and go on drunken rages. Fact: Some of Billy the Kid\'s friends said he never drank a drop and others said that he drank occasionally but never to the point of drunkenness. When one is living on the edge and can expect trouble at any moment, the Kid was bright enough to know it was best to keep himself sober and clear-headed. In an era when just about every man would have a drink, the Kid was probably a light social drinker, but was never a raving drunk. \n\n  Myth: Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid were close friends. Fact: This is another exaggerated issue of the legend of Billy the Kid. To have a friend-turn-lawman shoot his old outlaw buddy makes a great plot for novels and movies. Pat Garrett and the Kid no doubt knew each other, but they were not close friends. In Garrett\'s biography, The Authentic Life of Billy the Kid, when Tom OFolliard (a friend of the Kid\'s) was mortally wounded and in pain, the dying outlaw pleaded with Garrett that if he was a friend he would put him out of his misery. Garrett replied, I do not shoot at my friends as you have been shot. So if the story of Garrett and the Kid being friends is true, why then did Garrett accept the offer to run for sheriff in the first place? He knew his first duty was to bring down the Kid and he did more than that, he ambushed in the dark, then went one step further and wrote a book about him portraying him as a cold-blooded monster. Some Billy buffs cant accept the not friends theory and believe Garrett let his outlaw friend go and faked his death giving the Kid a chance to go square. Out of all the myths surrounding Billy the Kid that one is a doosey! See the final myth at the bottom of this page.\n\n  Myth: The most popular one of all: Billy the Kid killed 21 men, one for each of year of his life. Fact: Due to research and claims by those who knew him, we already came to the conclusion that the Kid never saw his 21st birthday. So we can scratch that one, as far as the 21 men he killed. Let\'s look at the tally: The Kid was solely responsible for the deaths of Frank Cahill (self-defense), Joe Grant (self-defense), James W. Bell and Bob Olinger (while escaping jail and an upcoming hanging). The Kid was one of many gunmen involved in the killing of Billy Morton, Frank Baker, William McCloskey, William Brady, and George Hindman. That makes five. Keep in mind the Kid wasnt the only one firing, and his bullets may or may not have found their mark. Then theres the controversial killing of Deputy James Carlyle. A deputy who was mistakenly shot and killed by his own posse who they thought was Billy the Kid. Of course the posse blamed the killing on the Kid, which caused him to lose what little favor he had with the public and not to mention any hopes of receiving a pardon from the governor. After looking into the shooting by reading the eyewitnesses\' accounts and the posse\'s behavior at the scene of the crime, evidence appears to be against the posse. If the Kid had been tried for this murder, he most likely would\'ve been acquitted due to circumstantial evidence. Therefore, Billy the Kid should not getthe credit for killing Carlyle. The Kid was blamed for killing Buckshot Roberts, but it was Charlie Bowdre who gave the feisty gunman his fatal wound. The Kid was also credited for killing another Dolan man, Charlie Crawford, during the big battle at McSween\'s house, but the true gunman was Fernando Herrera (Doc Scurlock\'s father-in-law), who shot Crawford as he rode towards town to join Peppin\'s posse during the siege at McSween\'s house. Another one pinned on the Kid was the killing of Robert Beckwith as he escaped from McSween\'s burning house, but credit most likely went to another Regulator or a stray bullet; Billy the Kid in the meantime, was too busy running for his life in another direction. Lastly, he was blamed for killing a Mescalero agency clerk, Morris Bernstein. While the Kid and his cohorts were watering their horses at a nearby spring several yards away, a gunfight broke out between Bernstein and Atanacio Martinez (who was riding with the Kid), which resulted in Martinez killing the clerk. In all of theseabove killings Billy the Kid never even fired a shot or was anywhere never the victim, but even so, legend has credited them allto him. But now that we know better, we won\'t count any of these. So in actuality, the Kid single handedly killed four men and participated in five shootings, now that makes the grand total of nine men. Note: these men were either killed in self-defense or during acts of war and were dangerous gunmen.Contrary to the myth, Billy the Kid did not kill a man just to see him kick or to prove his toughness. \n\n  Myth: Billy the Kid was not killed on July 14, 1881, but lived to be an old man. Fact: How I cringe to bring this one up, but it\'s probably the most debated topic on Billy the Kid, which means I have no choice. Just like with Jesse James and Butch Cassidy, there\'s a great many people who believe the Kid\'s death was a complete hoax and the famous outlaw rode off into the sunset and lived happily ever after. Well, this is just another tall tale added to the legend of Billy the Kid. This endless and heated debate can be compared to the argument of UFOs or Darwinism where people on both sides just talk circles around one another and get nowhere. I could easily talk myself blue in the face trying to convince some people that the Kid met his fate on July 14, 1881, and not even make a dent and they couldn\'t convince me otherwise. No one more than me would love to believe that Billy the Kid wasn\'t killed, but in the end he lived a peaceful and normal life. So with an open-mind I researched the story of Brushy Bill Roberts, an old man who claimed to be Billy the Kid and not only did I find his claim complete nonsense, but incongruous and an insult to the memory of Billy the Kid. Even so, Brushy Bill Robert\'s name has become symbolic with Billy the Kid\'s and the debate will live on. I\'d be the first to admit that the death of Billy the Kid is surrounded by conflicting testimonies, but that doesn\'t mean the Kid wasn\'t killed. If a robbery takes place at a bank, and investigators interview ten witnesses, they will hear ten different versions of what happened, what those people saw and how they perceived it. Even though the information given is conflicting, it doesn\'t mean the robbery never took place. The investigators then do their own research of the evidence and try to match eyewitness testimonies and then come to a conclusion. So after my investigation, I came to the conclusion that Billy the Kid was indeed killed on July 14, 1881 by Sheriff Garrett. Let\'s think about this logically, during the pursuit for Billy the Kid, Garrett shot and killed two of his friends, O\'Folliard and Bowdre, because he thought they were the Kid, obviously this tells us that Garrett meant to kill Billy the Kid by any means necessary -now what kind of a friend is that?! Why also, would Garrett help the Kid fake his death after the Kid humiliated him by escaping his jail and killing two of his deputies? There\'s also no way Garrett could have gotten away with accidentally killing another man by mistake and then passing the body off as the Kid without word leaking out or the Kid suddenly reappearing in the area. Why would Deluvina Maxwell visit the Kid\'s grave for years following his death or Fort Sumner residents chipping in and buying the tombstone, if the Kid wasn\'t really buried there? On another note, when Brushy Bill Roberts was questioned, he couldn\'t remember important events that happened in the Kid\'s life, such as his escape from Lincoln (Brushy claimed there was no shooting going on, which means Olinger and Bell weren\'t killed). Brushy also looked no way shape or form like Billy the Kid. Brushy had gray eyes with yellow specks while the Kid had clear blue eyes; Brushy had a squarer shaped jaw while the Kid\'s was rounder; the ears are completely different and lastly, Billy\'s shoulders are much more slopped and narrower than Brushy\'s. Brushy was also illiterate, in which the Kid was not. Lastly, Brushy\'s niece, Mrs. Geneva Pittmon, would say that Brushy\'s birth date is recorded in the family bible as 1879, which means he was a toddler still running around in short pants when the Kid was killed. This is just a small sample of my argument. Maybe it\'s easier for some people to believe conspiracy theories that the Kid escaped assassination and lived to a ripe old age, than to accept conflicting testimony, and because most would like a happy ending. But the truth of the matter is, since his death is controversial and facts are conflicting, it\'s not because his death was a hoax, but most likely he was killed not by coincidence, but by a planned ambush.

Had they done the analysis correctly, the under-reporting wouldn\'t have mattered (other than that you need to be clear what your definition of \"left-handed\" is).\n\n\n\nThey did the analysis by simply looking at the age at death and taking an average. That is a fundamentally flawed method that will give meaningless answers in a wide range of situations (including this one). The correct method actuaries use to calculate life expectancies is to look at deaths at each age divided by the \"exposed to risk\". That is, the number of people that could have died at that age.\n\n\n\nBasically, you take the number of people that died aged x and divide it by the number of people that were alive on their xth birthday. That gives you the probability of someone dying in the year following their xth birthday (you need to make a few adjustments to allow for that fact that people can\'t die more than once, that people may leave the population for reasons other that death and that people may join the population already aged x, but they aren\'t important).\n\n\n\nOnce you have the probability of death at each age, you can calculated the life expectancy for someone at a particular age (the probability of them having a particular age at death is the probability of them surviving to that age multiplied by the probability of them dying at that age, once you have that for each age you can take a weighted average of the ages to get the expectation). That can be very different to the average age at death, since average age at death depends on the age distribution of the population. There was such a large error in this study due to the very large difference in the age distributions of left- and right-handed people, but there would still have been an error even without that since they were simply measuring the wrong thing.','2017-03-25 03:51:14'),(653,85,'ca39e3bfe2ea322c250266be1ec6ec5eaa853c702dd73b1e1fc76cadd95bfad0','8e136aa31e354baabf509f71c057bbf9','','','Much of the last century or so has been dedicated to alleviating the plight of minorities, from one human rights campaign to the next. But in all this time, one group has consistently fallen through the cracks, remaining disadvantaged in almost every category. We\'re talking about left-handed people. It seems innocuous, but being born with this crippling condition means that ...\n\nStudies have shown that the number of left-handers who make it to old age is drastically lower than the number of their right-handed peers. In short, lefties tend to check out earlier. Why? Well, for one, lefties just have more accidents. Lots more accidents. One study surveying nearly 2,000 college students found that lefties report far more accidents than righties, especially car accidents. And another study of around 1,000 people living in Southern California showed that the risk of getting into a fatal accident was nearly six times higher if you were left-handed, and the risk of getting into a deadly car crash was four times higher. Perhaps not surprisingly, it was also found that right-handed people usually make it through nine more birthdays than left-handers.\n\nSo why are left-handed people so much more likely to kill themselves accidentally? Are they just fatally clumsy? Are they, as many cultures believe, such an affront to nature that nature actively seeks to destroy them? The most agreed upon explanation is that lefties get in more accidents simply because they\'re trying to maneuver in a world that\'s upside down and backward to them.\n\n\n\n Know what? We\'re OK with the whole no flying cars thing.\n\nProbably the most notable example of dangerous right-bias is United States road laws -- we travel on the right side of the road, right-hand turns are acceptable on red lights and even parking lots are designed with the right-handed flow in mind. Imagine that you\'re driving to work during peak hours when a squirrel (most likely a right-handed squirrel) darts into the middle of the lane. If you\'re right-handed, your response is likely to swerve to the right, up onto the sidewalk, causing a potentially hilarious scene like hitting a fire hydrant. But if you\'re left-handed, you jerk the wheel left into oncoming traffic, resulting in a situation with far less comedy potential.\n\n\n\n Unless you\'re British.

Itpurported to demonstrate a statistically significant difference in longevity between right and left handers, based on data collected on professional baseball players:\n\nTo investigate further the relationship between handedness and age of death, we have analysed all baseball players listed in The Baseball Encyclopedia for whom dates of birth and death, as well as throwing and batting hand, are reported. A subject was assigned to a handedness a group only when both throwing and batting hand were the same with no indicated I change in hand use. Mean age at death for the 1,472 right-handers was 64.64 years (s.d. = 15.5) and ( 236 left-handers was 63.97 years (s.d. = 15.4).\n\nThese same authors published another study(Handedness and Life Span) in the equally prestigious New England Journal of Medicine by sampling the death records for the year 1990 in two California counties, which demonstrated  they argued  an even larger difference in lifespan between left and right handers:\n\nIn order to test the relation between handedness and life span in a general population, we obtained death certificates from two counties in southern California. Two thousand questionnaires concerning the handedness of the deceased family member were sent to the listed next of kin, which resulted in 987 usable cases (495 male subjects and 492 female subjects). Subjects were designated as right-handers if they wrote, drew, and threw a ball with the right hand. All other subjects (left-handers and mixed-handers) were assigned to a non-right-handed group. When we turn to the effect of handedness on life span, the results are striking in their magnitude. The mean age at death in the right-handed sample was 75 years, as compared with the life-span for the left-handers is significant (Fl,945 = 22.36, P<0.0001).\n\nCritics of these studies have noted that their methodologies are flawed, as they assume an staticproportion of left and right handed people throughout time  despite the fact that many people who were born in early 1900s were likely pressured to become right-handed at an early age, and would not identify as left-handed at death. Historical records support this argument, presented in the book Language Lateralization and Psychosis:\n\nAbout 90% of people are right-handed and 10% are lefthanded []. It is probable that about 8% to 10% of the population has been left-handed for at least the past 200 000 years or so. Detailed data only began to become available for those born in the nineteenth century, and there is growing evidence that the rate of left-handedness fell precipitously during the Victorian period, reaching a nadir of about 3% in about 1895 or so, and then rising quite quickly until an asymptote is reached for those born after about 1945 to 1950, with 11% to 12% of men and 9% to 10% of women typically being left-handed in Western countries.\n\nThis means that taking at a single cohort of individuals who died in the year 1990 would be biased by the fact that people who identified as left handers were, statistically speaking, a younger group of people. A good explanation of the result of such a bias is provided in a series of letters to the editor regarding the NEJM study, notably this one from epidemiologist Kenneth Rothman:\n\nComparing mean ages at death is a classic fallacy, as it involves comparing only the numerators of rates, rather than the rates themselves. Using the same approach as Halpern and Coren, one would conclude that nursery school is more dangerous than paratrooper training, since the mean age at death of children in nursery school is much lower than that of paratrooper trainees.\n\nThis same question wasaddressed using data from the Danish Twin Registry, which looked at 118 opposite-handed twin pairs to see which individual died first:\n\nThis approach, which is not biased by the same statistical issues as the previous studies, agrees with the general scientific consensus that longevity and handedness are completely unrelated.','2017-03-25 03:51:14'),(656,86,'ce219bc50a38866780d4869393c14559ffa41cbb3664a331fcb4f70de5c9940c','d5cd7e12fea448728b4ab4f6454fa2f9','','','When Showa Japan invaded the Dutch East Indies in 1942, different groups began to compete for the goodwill of their new colonial masters. In the course of these events remaining Europeans were either killed or sent as forced labour into Japanese concentration camps. Many Indonesians had welcomed the Japanese as liberators but their hopes were soon balked. The occupying power brutally quelled resistance since its ultimate aim was to incorporate the East Indies into the Greater East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere  a Japanese dominated imperial order.\n\nNonetheless, in their attempts to mobilize the population for World War II, the Japanese gave Indonesias Nationalist and Islamic organizations political opportunities they had been denied by their old colonial masters. And when the Showa leaders finally realized that they could no longer win the Pacific War, they began to actively prepare a selected national elite for Indonesias independence. The aim of such policy was to frustrate the reconquest of the allied powers, so that when the Dutch returned to Indonesia in 1945 their old colonial order no longer existed. Instead, Sukarnos armed independence movement was ready to challenge the Dutch presence in the archipelago. After four years of guerrilla warfare the Nationalist movement finally succeeded in ending more than 300 years of the Dutch colonial presence in the East Indies.\n\nAmong historians there is a consensus that the Japanese occupation was a turning point and decisive factor in the history of Indonesia paving the way for independence. Ever since the Ethical Policys education program provided a native elite with the intellectual weapons to articulate resistance against the Dutch, the premises for Indonesian Nationalism were laid.\n\nHowever, given the success that the Dutch had in opressing the small and mainly Javanese Nationalist movement, it is unlikely that Indonesian Nationalism would ever have grown into a political force capable of both unifying the multi-ethnic population and challenging Dutch military power, if the Japanese had not intervened and provided the Nationalists with, first, a platform to spread their ideas; and second, military training and weapons for their war of independence.\n\nIn assessing the impact of the Japanese occupation the main question at issue is whether social conflicts in post-independent Indonesia were to a greater or lesser extent the product of Japanese occupation policy, or rather the result of Dutch colonialism. This series of articles is going to address the debate by identifying the ramifications of the Japanese occupation on the Indonesian archipelago. During the course of this series it will be demonstrated that whereas the Dutch had divided and ruled their colony, Japanese occupation policy stimulated Indonesian revolt. All in all, it will therefore be argued that Japans occupation policy had a unifying effect on Indonesian society. However, the Nationalist movement cultivated by Showa Japan predisposed the country to an authoritarian, militaristic and Javanese dominated political culture that has proved to be an ongoing source of conflict in Indonesia.\n\nJapanese occupation policy had two priorites: firstly, to wipe out Western influence, and secondly, to exploit Indonesias economic and human resources for the Japanese war effort. This was achieved through the establishment of the most opressive and devastating regime in Indonesian history. A deadly combination of forced labour, deprivation, food shortages, and day-to-day terror by the military police made the Japanese occupation the only period in the 20th century in which the overall population of the East Indies declined.\n\nThe archipelago was divided into three regions. Each was governed according to its economic and strategical importance. Since Java was considered, on the one hand the most cultural and political advanced, but on the other the least economic and strategical significant area  its main resource being people  it was not governed as repressively as outer areas under the navys control. The eastern islands at the periphery of the archipelago, such as the Mollucas, were on the front-line of military activity and subject to a much greater exploitation of economic and human resources. Military destruction and the decline of important agricultural sectors and industries would further intensify the pre-existing disparate socio-economic development of Java and the periphery islands in the turbulent years following independence.\n\nAnother factor to keep in mind is that Japanese occupation policy stimulated nationalism in Java, and to a lesser extent in Sumatra, more than on the outer islands. Part of the reasons for this divergence is, firstly, the periphery islands were considered to be culturally primitive; secondly, it was not planned that in case of a victorious conquest of Asia these areas should become part of a nominal independent Indonesian colony. Rather they would become an official Japanese province serving as a buffer zone to defend the borders of their imperial order.\n\nOn these grounds Showa Japan had little interest in unifying the population of these areas under the banner of a shared Indonesian identity. In Java  on the other hand  the Japanese collaborated with a selected native elite that, after having been oppressed under the Dutch, was now increasingly given a platform to articulate their nationalist ideas. At the end of World War II, this Javanese elite surrounding Sukarno had been prepared by the Japanese to combat Dutch presence and eventually come to dominate the victorious Republican forces during the wars of independence. Sukarnos Pancasila  a political philosophy combining socialism, nationalism and monotheism  was declared to be the official ideological foundation of the Indonesian state. This sort of secular-oriented political framework was developed to reconcile conflicting priorities between the countries Muslim majority population, Nationalists, Communists and various religious minority groups.\n\nHowever, due to the centralist nature of the political system, the political process in post-independent Indonesia has since largely been dominated by Javanese elites. Japanese occupation policy thus enhanced the pre-existing greater social and political sophistication of Java over the outter islands, thereby fostering the emergence of a Javanese dominated political order. For the same reason, Pancasila failed to establish a strong bond of identification with the central governments in many of the outer islands.\n\nOn the periphery of the archipelago the Japanese generally adopted a more repressive attitude towards political factions, and it was not until the Japanese leaders had acknowledged their defeat that they decided to encourage revolutionary forces in order to frustrate the Allied reconquest. Since Japans priority was to be victorious on the battlefield, it was simply more practical to rely upon the experienced native administration of the Dutch colonial state to administer their occupied land.\n\nHowever, one exemption of this rule was Ambon  an area that, due to its history and large Christian population, was suspected to be pro-Dutch. In Ambon members of Sarekat Ambon were appointed to the most senior positions within the administration. Thus, the Nationalists, whom the Dutch had little difficulties to oppress, were now put in a position of control over their former opponents, the favourite children of the Dutch. Furthermore, the Christian Ambonese soldiers  who had formed the backbone of the colonial army and of which many had formed a close identification with the Dutch  were no longer trusted and often ended up suffering a miserable fate in Japanese concentration camps.\n\nThis was a change of symbolic significance since it was precisely the image of being Black Dutchmen that made the Christian Ambonese unpopular in the eyes of other Indonesians. While Ambonese Muslims, of which many had established close links with the Japanese occupation regime, supported the Republican forces during the war of independence, the Ambonese Christians, after having been opressed by Showa Japan, were the last to disband their bond with the Dutch.\n\nConsequently the groups loyalty to the Indonesian national cause was questioned and, accordingly, Ambonese Christians were excluded from positions of power and influence. Largely because of this marginalization an armed Christian rebellion emerged in 1950 demanding independence from the central government. In fact, the armed struggle for independence by Mollucan Christians continued to destabilize the area until 1963.\n\nNevertheless, all things considered Japanese occupation policy had a unifying effect on Indonesian society. That is because the Japanese departed from the Dutch practice of oppressing Nationalist and Islamic movements in the most populated areas of Java and Sumatra. While the indigenous administration of the Dutch was largely maintained, the Japanese attempted to mobilize political factions for their propaganda and war efforts.\n\nContrary to what has been claimed by Dutch historians in the 1940s and 1950s, the political exploitation of these groups was not driven by a motivation to divide and rule the Indonesian population. According to a new generation of historians, an evaluation of available Japanese primary sources does not indicate that the military felt seriously threatened by any Indonesian faction  except for the rebellious Ambonese Christians.\n\nThis highlights that, first, the preserving of superficial social harmony was a matter of lower priority for Showa Japan than it was for the Dutch; second, the cultivation of Nationalist and Islamic groups was motivated not so much by a need for balance but by a greater usefullness of these groups for Japans propaganda and war efforts. Given that before the invasion there had been little social relations between the traditional native elites and Nationalist and Islamic parties, Japanese occupation policy cannot be held solely responsible for all the destablizing divisions that have plagued Indonesian society since independence.\n\nIt is true that by providing military training to members of the Islamic PUSA party, including Kartusiwirjo  who would later emerge as leader of the Darul Islam movement  the Japanese made possible the emergence of a destabilizing Islamist insurgency. Yet, it is also true that by incoorporating both the old elites of the Dutch colonial state as well as members of Nationalist and Islamic parties into various administrative, advisory and propaganda positions, where they were required to cooperate, Japanese occupation policy helped to overcome many divisions that had plagued Indonesian society since colonial times.\n\nThis is largely because the Dutch had divided and ruled their colony under the pretext of tolerating native customary law and traditions: firstly, by providing distinct systems of jurisprudence for different racial groups; and secondly, by providing two different kinds of education  one designed for the privileged native elites and emphasizing the teaching of Western culture, and one that was taught in the local languages and offered little more than basic literacy skills. The Japanese  on the other hand  put an end to this discriminative practice, which was consistent with their ultimate aim to transform parts of Indonesia into a semi-independent colony. Accordingly, it was in the interest of Showa Japan to unify the population in these areas under the banner of an anti-Western and Pan-Asian Nationalism. The idea was to achieve this through the introduction of an egalitarian judiciary and education system that applied to all, irrespective of their ethnic and religious background.\n\nThe elimination of Dutch influence and mobilization of the population for the Japanese war effort demanded the systematic indoctrination of Indonesians throughout the archipelago. Although this constant propaganda failed to convince Indonesians of the apparent superiority of Japanese culture, it did, however, intensify anti-Western and nationalistic attitudes, which in the process helped unify Indonesians in their commitment to independence.\n\nPatriotic flag ceremonies and military rituals were introduced into schools. Western languages were banned and there were some unsuccessful efforts to promote Japanese among the population. Ultimately though, Malay had been used as the major language to spread propaganda and it became Indonesias national language. The unifying factor of this move was significant given there are over 20 different languages spoken within the archipelago. Indeed, it was only after Japanese occupation that Malay was declared the national language and subsequently widely adopted by Indonesians. Finally, the Japanese replaced the euro-centric education focus of the Dutch with one that emphasized East Indies culture, arts and music, thereby contributing to the development of a common sense of identity. The sum of these changes proves that without Japans intervention, Indonesian nationalism would have never emerged as a mass movement.\n\nNevertheless, the kind of nationalism promoted by Showa Japan was one that predisposed Indonesia to a radical nationalist, authoritarian and militaristic political culture  a trend that has been further reinforced by a high level of diversity and conflicting interests, which in turn entail the need for increased repression by the central government in order to maintain the appearance of superficial harmony. What unified most Indonesians during the war of independence was not a common cultural identity but widespread opposition to a Dutch colonial state that was considered worse than Sukarnos centralistic political order. For this reason, the central government failed to maintain the loyalty of many Indonesians in the outer islands, meaning that the stability of the system could only be achieved through the same nationalist, authoritarian and militaristic political culture which Showa Japan had promoted.\n\nOther reasons for such authoritarian tendencies can be ascribed to the propaganda of Showa Japan: emphasizing values such as self-sacrifice and obedience only perpetuated a pre-existing tendency within Asian societies to prioritize commitment to the community over individual freedoms. And most importantly, by providing arms and military training to large segments of the population, the Japanese contributed to Indonesias militarization. Since the war for Indonesias independence was one in which military and political aims converged, the roles of political and military leaders were, from the very beginning, indistinguishable. As a consequence, the army did not restrict itself to political neutrality in the years following the National revolution. By pointing out the sacrifices that it made for the sake of Indonesias independence, the military demanded it play an active political role in the Indonesian state.\n\nAccordingly, Indonesias army leaders have always assumed a priviliged role for themselves which has enabled them to intervene in politics whenever their grip on power became threatened. As long as Sukarno was able to balance the power between the army and its main political rival  the Indonesian Communist party  the stability of the Guided Democracy system could be maintained. However, in the 1960s, when Sukarno allied himself more closely with the PKI, internal power struggles turned out to be too much for the system to bear. After leading army officials were murdered in 1965 by what was claimed to be a PKI plot, a brutal political cleansing campaign was launched, during which more than half million suspected Communist symphatizers were murdered. The dramatic events of 1965-66 thus unleashed the worst excesses of the kind of militarism that had been cultivated during the Japanese occupation.\n\nEventually, the left-leaning and politically weakened Sukarno was forced to cede power to General Suharto  who would govern the country for the next 30 years as an authoritarian despot.','2017-03-25

Far away in the central Pacific, there was a military detachment on Fanning Island, and a number of service and civilian coastwatchers based in the Gilbert Islands.\n\nIt was at Butaritari Atoll on the northern Gilbert Islands that New Zealanders felt the first direct impact of the Japanese advance. On 10 December 1941, Japanese troops occupied Butaritari, capturing seven coastwatchers in the process. As some of the first Allied prisoners of war transported to Japan, they were the object of some curiosity and were treated well. The rest of the coastwatchers were less fortunate.\n\nBy mid-1942 the Japanese had established an extensive perimeter, stretching from Wake Island in the east, through the northern Gilbert Islands to Rabaul, New Britain. To the north, Japanese forces overran Hong Kong, British Borneo, and Malaya. The key British base at Singapore fell in February 1942, followed by the Dutch East Indies (modern-day Indonesia), Burma and the Philippines. These losses, particularly that of the impregnable fortress of Singapore, left many New Zealanders feeling defenceless and fearful of an imminent Japanese invasion.\n\nImage:New Zealand National Savings Committee poster, 1942, which tapped into New Zealand\'s fear of coastal attack by Japan.','2017-03-25 03:51:14'),(659,86,'ce219bc50a38866780d4869393c14559ffa41cbb3664a331fcb4f70de5c9940c','28c11dc524404b65839520772cb2931f','','','During World War II, did Imperial Japan seriously consider invading Australia? Yes, warned official Australian propaganda at the time. It worked so well that most Australians today still believe their country faced an imminent threat back then. But military historians disagree: Japan did not want to overstretch its forces, and opted to isolate rather than invade Australia.\n\nThe debate is not merely academic. Invasion paranoia is a recurring theme in Australian history (1). It still informs the nativist fringe of the political spectrum and, it could even be argued, is the unmentionable wellspring of the country\'s current hard stance on illegal immigration.\n\nAustralia\'s Japan-centred paranoia peaked after the Fall of Singapore in February 1942. For Australia, that dramatic victory of the Japanese over the British signified the breaching of the so-called \"Malay Barrier,\" a notional line of defence separating Japan\'s expanding Empire from Australia\'s home front.\n\nOne telling example of the nationwide panic mode occurred in early 1943. Two Australian military observers on patrol in northern Queensland spotted a group of white shapes in the distance. God! Japanese bloody sailors! exclaimed one. The other recollected later: Ahead of us we could see what looked like two dozen white uniforms and caps moving () It turned out to be three brolgas (Australian cranes), magnified by the heat haze.\n\nThe anecdote is recalled in He is (Not) Coming South  The Invasion that Wasn\'t, a paper in which noted Australian military historian Peter Stanley argues against the popular perception that Japan planned to invade Australia, and that, by extension, Australia\'s wartime premier John Curtin was effective at deflecting the threat.\n\nStanley points out that, although in the euphoria of victory early in 1942 some visionary middle-ranking naval staff officers in Tokyo proposed that () Australia should be invaded, in order to forestall it being used as a base for an Allied counter-offensive (which of course it became), the idea was dismissed by the military hierarchy, unable to spare the million tons of shipping the invasion would have consumed.\n\nJapan\'s military hardware and manpower were needed more in China and against the Soviet threat. But few in Australia at the time were level-headed enough to draw that conclusion. The public mood was one of general panic before an impending doom. And, Stanley says, the Curtin government abetted and fuelled (this) popular disquiet.Exhibit A: a government-produced poster showing a Japanese soldier advancing towards a map of Australia. The header reads: He\'s Coming South. The subheader: It\'s Fight, Work or Perish.\n\nSome deemed the poster too alarmist; the state government of Queensland banned it for that reason. The Curtin government\'s own Committee on National Morale warned that an overpowering sense of danger could thrust idealism into the background and replace it with a crude physical self-preservation.\n\nStanley indicates that Curtin himself believed in the imminence of the Japanese threat. If so, the map below will have done nothing to calm the Prime Minister\'s nerves. It was part of a report prepared by Australia\'s chiefs of staff in October 1942, entitled \"Japanese Plan for Invasion of Australia.\" The map showed how a diversionary attack on Darwin, in Australia\'s Northern Territory, would clear the way for the main Japanese attack on Perth and Fremantle in Western Australia, after which the Imperial troops would advance eastward toward the country\'s major population centres on the east coast. Japanese legends are helpfully transcribed in English.\n\nThe map was forwarded to the Chiefs of Staff by the Australian legation in Chongqing, at the time the provisional capital of Chiang Kai-shek\'s Chinese nationalist forces. The legation got the map from Admiral H.C. Yang, Nationalist China\'s director of military intelligence.\n\nIn March 1943, PM Curtin showed the map to Australian journalists as confirmation of Japan\'s intention to invade. But, as Stanley argues, the Chinese themselves thought the map was a fake, as did all of Curtin\'s military advisers. Which leaves the question: Who made it  and why?\n\nCould it have been someone in Australian intelligence, eager to produce a \"smoking gun\"? Is it possible that Curtin, who repeatedly, unsuccessfully petitioned the British and Americans for more troops to protect Australia, knew more of its true origins?\n\nAround that time, even Curtin had become convinced that the Japanese threat, if it ever had been real, had now receded. That didn\'t stop the Australian government from launching yet another fear-inducing poster by mid-1943. Ringed with menace!showed a tourist post card image of Australia, with locals surfing and playing soccer but surrounded by a black ring of Japanese submarines. To the north: Japanese-occupied Indonesia and the island of New Guinea, contested between Japanese and Allied forces.\n\nStanley suggests that Curtin kept up the pretence of an imminent threat for electoral purposes the prime minister\'s Australian Labor Party went on to win a two-thirds majority in the August 1943 parliamentary elections. The World War may be receding in history, but exaggerating foreign threats for political gain: That sounds genuinely modern.\n\nFor Peter Stanley\'s entire paper here.

In March 1942, Life Magazine published six different scenarios for a Nazi invasion of the U.S. (see #497). While those maps were presented as the work of Life Magazine itself, another invasion map, showing Germany\'s designs on Latin America, was presented as genuine  but was also a fake (see #250).\n\n(1) Australia had a \'whites-only\' immigration policy until the early 1970s.

The invasion was part of the Pacific War in South-East Asia during World War II and led to the capture of the island. The invasion of Sumatra was planned to occur prior to the invasion of Java to destroy the west flank of the allies and to give access to Java.\n\nAfter the Japanese successfully conquered the Malay Peninsula, the Allies began to transfer personnel in December 1941 to Sumatra. First British and Australian bombers were moved in relays to the south of the island to recuperate from losses on the Malay peninsula. In addition, a convoy brought about 3,400 Australian soldiers to Sumatra.\n\nIn a joint conference on 16 December, the Dutch requested aid to strengthen the defence of Sumatra and Java. Furthermore, plans were made in Sabang to establish Medan and Pekanbaru supply camps. However, these plans were revised on the 27 December, with airfields P1 (Pangkalanbenteng) and P2 (Praboemoelih) near Palembang selected as locations of the new headquarters to station an operational bomber relay. P2 had not been discovered by the Japanese reconnaissance flights up to then. Because of the poor state of the airfields, the relocation began on 31 December; available ground staff arrived at the beginning of January. Another airfield was located in Oosthaven, today\'s Bandar Lampung. Works on roads were also started in Medan and Pekanbaru. Lack of anti-aircraft guns was remedied with the delivery of six heavy and six light Bofors anti-aircraft guns to each Palembang airfield.[8] Another eight anti-aircraft guns were placed at the refineries.[8] However, there was an ammunition shortage, because the ammunition delivery ships had been sunk by the Japanese during the crossing.[8]\n\nThe first Japanese air raid came on 6 February and hit the P1 airfield at Palembang. The Allies lost two Blenheim bombers and four Hurricanes. Two other Hurricanes were damaged. On the ground, the Japanese destroyed two Buffalos. During the attack, the Allies shot down only a single Japanese Nakajima Ki-43. As a countermove, the Allies began night raids against the Japanese lines on the Malay peninsula and provided air protection for refugee convoys from Singapore.\n\nFor Operation \"L\", the Japanese army had transported the 229th Infantry Regiment of the 38th Infantry Division from Hong Kong to Cam Ranh Bay in Indo-China. From there, eight transports departed on 9 February 1942, protected by a cruiser, four destroyers, five minesweepers and two submarine hunters under the command of Rear Admiral Shintar Hashimoto to invade Bangka and Palembang. The next day Rear Admiral Jisabur Ozawa followed with the Western Covering Fleet, consisting of the flagship cruiser Chkai with five other cruisers and three destroyers and an Air Group under the command of Rear Admiral Kakaji Kakuta consisting of the aircraft carrier Ryj and one destroyer. The bulk of the invasion force followed on 11 February in thirteen transports which were accompanied by a heavy cruiser, a frigate, four destroyers and a submarine hunter.\n\nThe Dutch tanker Manvantara was sunk by Japanese aircraft on 13 February 1942 in the Java Sea.[9] Four Dutch submarines lay in wait at the Anambas Islands; however, these could not reach the Japanese fleet. The transports reached Singapore, and subsequently Allied refugee freighters which were on the move in the direction of Java and Sumatra were attacked by Japanese airplanes from the Ryj. Apart from that they also damaged the British light cruiser Durban which had to turn away to Colombo. The Japanese attacked repeatedly with airplanes from the Ryj and with land-based bombers from the Genzan aerial unit. Two Allied tankers, a steamboat and many smaller vessels were sunk, another tanker and two transports severely damaged.\n\nAt 8 o\'clock in the morning on 14 February the air-raid wardens warned Palembang of a big Japanese attack wave which was in flight to the town. All available Allied air forces were at that time on missions to protect the sea convoys and were not in radio reach. Firstly, a wave of Japanese bombers dropped its load on airfield P1, followed by strafing from accompanying fighters. Shortly afterwards, 260 Japanese paratroopers of the First Japanese Airborne Division landed at P1. They came from the captured airfield of Kahang in Malaya. The second wave consisting of 100 paratroopers from Kluang landed shortly afterwards some kilometres to the west of P1 near the refinery.\n\nIn defence were only 150 British anti-aircraft men, 110 Dutch soldiers and 75 British ground defence men at P1. While the Japanese piled up vehicles to make road blocks small gun battles broke out with the defenders and some landed airplanes succeeded in refuelling. The airplanes immediately flew to the undiscovered airfield, P2. The headquarters also moved to P2 after news from the refinery and from Palembang arrived. In the afternoon it came to a deadlock. The British still held the airfield, but, their ammunition was short and they were hindered by the street blockade. After a false report of other Japanese parachute landings at about 25 kilometres of distance spread the British commander, H. G. Maguire, decided to evacuate the airfield and the town. On the next day another 100 Japanese landed at the refinery. After a violent fight which continued the whole day, the defenders forced back the Japanese, but the refinery was heavily damaged by machine gun fire and was aflame. Other surrounding smaller facilities had been damaged.\n\nMeanwhile, the escort fleet had sortied under Vice Admiral Ozawa to the north of Bangka to form a far-reaching cover screen for the Japanese landings which took place shortly afterward. A vanguard went ashore on Bangka, while the main units had landed near Palembang at the mouth of the Musi river and advanced on along the river to the town. A defence at the mouth had not been put up by the Dutch because it was judged by them as useless against the artillery fire expected from the ships.\n\nAt this time Japanese reconnaissance planes sighted the ABDA fleet, under Rear Admiral Karel Doorman, at Gasperstrasse on a northerly course. On Wavell\'s order, Doorman had collected the fleet, consisting of the Dutch cruisers De Ruyter, Java and Tromp, as well as the British cruiser Exeter and the Australian light cruiser Hobart with ten destroyers, to the south of Bali and sortied on 14 February in the direction of Sumatra. Japanese fighter aircraft of the Ryj and from Malaya attacked the ABDA fleet at midday of the next day and made Doorman pull back all his ships to the south.\n\nThe invasion fleet in the Bangka Strait had also been spotted by British reconnaissance planes from P2. In the early morning 22 Hurricanes, 35 Blenheims and three Hudsons, tried to attack the ships. Nevertheless, they were engaged by Japanese airplanes in violent aerial battles. At P2 the news of the Japanese parachute landing at P1 became known. The commander initiated the preparations for an evacuation of the airfield. Then, however, the later arriving news that P1 had not been given up yet led to the returned machines being prepared at night for a new attack. In the morning fog the Allied fighter aircraft made violent attacks against the Japanese who had just begun their landing at the mouth of the Musi. Japanese airplanes withdrew shortly after the battle began, so that the Allies succeeded in getting direct hits on the transporters. Twenty landing craft were sunk and, besides, hundreds of Japanese were killed. The last Allied results achieved were by Hurricanes attacking unprotected landing craft on the southwest beach of Bangka.\n\nMeanwhile, the Dutch command had sent the order for the destruction of the oil dumps and rubber dumps. The ferries on the Musi should be destroyed within the next hour so they could not be used by the Japanese. Also the defenders of P1 were to start a quick retreat. On the night of 15 February Japanese units, which had survived the air raid at the Musi mouth, reached Palembang and relieved the paratroopers landed at P1 and the refinery.\n\nField Marshal Archibald Percival Wavell was the Supreme Commander of ABDA.[10] In the morning of 15 February Wavell arranged a regular retreat to the embarkation of his troops at Oosthaven where several small ships lay in the harbour. There 2,500 British RAF members, 1,890 British infantrymen, 700 Dutch soldiers and about 1,000 civilians were evacuated by means of twelve ships on 17 February. The Australian corvette Burnie covered the retreat and destroyed harbour facilities and oil tanks.[2] A smaller steamboat lay at anchor a little while longer in the harbour to be able to take up later arriving refugees.\n\nIn the interim the Japanese had completely taken Palembang and had destroyed the oil refineries at two smaller stations. Small troop transporters steamed up the river to Menggala.\n\nAll remaining airworthy Allied fighter aircraft were flown out on 16 February. The staff of the airfields proceeded by sea to India. Because the Japanese did not advance for the time being to Oosthaven, a task force went ashore there once again on 20 February to save airplane spare parts as well as to destroy the other usable facilities.\n\nOn the 24 February the Japanese reached Gelumbang.\n\nThe Allied units remaining on Sumatra, primarily from the Royal Netherlands East Indies Army (KNIL), withdrew into the middle and northern provinces of the island. The Dutch planned a reconquest of Palembang from there and the expulsion of the Japanese from the island. This was frustrated by an aggressive Japanese pursuit from Palembang with a motorized reconnaissance regiment of approximately 750 men. The outnumbered and retreating forces under Major C.F. Hazenberg numbered only about 350 KNIL regulars in two companies. They were also badly dispersed and could only fight delaying actions, which allowed the better trained and equipped Japanese to rapidly advance. After three weeks, the Japanese were finally contained at Moearatebo on March 2. Dutch reinforcements from Padangpandjang were able to move up when heavy rains made the rivers all but impassable by running 27 feet over their flood gauges. This delay gave local KNIL commanders time to deploy additional units from the middle provinces, thus preventing the retreating units flank from being turned.[11]\n\nMarch 37 saw vicious firefights as Japanese units tried to cross the river. As the offensive ground to a halt, Dutch spies returned with reports of many dead and wounded. They also reported that the regiment now numbered only about 200 men. Buoyed by the reports, Major Hazenberg decided to counterattack on the night of March 89. On the 7-8th, several native boats were assembled out of sight and loaded with supplies and ammunition while assault groups formed.[11] However, on the 8th of March the news of the capitulation of Java arrived, all offensive efforts had to be broken off because Sumatra was dependent on supply deliveries from Java and it was decided to take a defensive course. West Sumatra had to be left to the Japanese and only a small part of the north would be held with the available forces as long as possible, until a sea evacuation could be organised.\n\nIn the retreat the KNIL units destroyed all airfields and harbour facilities. They withdrew into defensive positions at the south entrance of the Alice valley where they planned to detain the Japanese as long as possible.[11] Should the positions fall, a guerrilla war from the environs was planned. Indeed, it would turn out to be difficult because the population of Sumatra did not cooperate with the Dutch, as a long-standing colonial power, but on the contrary would betray to the Japanese the Dutch positions. This was especially clear when the Dutch wanted to move about 3,000 Europeans and Christian civilians in refugee camps from the coast of Aceh province. A Muslim uprising which broke out shortly after the beginning of the Japanese landings prevented the action.\n\nOperation T began on 28 February when 27 transports with 22,000 soldiers of the Imperial Guard aboard sailed from Singapore. They were split in four convoys and were accompanied by three cruisers, ten destroyers, patrol boats and submarine-defensive units. Because the allied air defence and sea defence was non-existent at that time, they reached north Sumatra absolutely unchecked.[11]\n\nOn 12 March the Kobayashi Detachment took Sabang Island and the airfield at Koetaradja without running into opposition. Yoshida Detachment had landed south of Idi with a single infantry battalion with orders to seize the Lantja and Pangkalan Brandan oilfields. It would then drive south towards Medan and apply pressure on Dutch positions there. The main force landed about four miles northwest of Tandjoengtiram. It was to drive along the Pematang Siantar-Balige-Taroetoeng Highway and cut off any KNIL forces attempting to withdraw from Medan and also to drive north to Medan and seize the airfield there.[11]\n\nSumatra fell on 28 March when the Dutch Major General R. T. Overakker with 2,000 soldiers surrendered near the town of Kutatjane in North Sumatra.[1] Many Allied prisoners were forced by the Japanese to construct a railroad line between Pekanbaru and Moera.[12] (Overakker together with other officers of the KNIL in captivity were shot in 1945 in view of the impending defeat of the Japanese.)[1]','2017-03-25 03:51:14'),(661,86,'ce219bc50a38866780d4869393c14559ffa41cbb3664a331fcb4f70de5c9940c','378cbda50c3b4353bcdc4f7ade31faa8','','','The Japanese Empire occupied the Dutch East Indies, now Indonesia, during World War II from March 1942 until after the end of the War in 1945. The period was one of the most critical in Indonesian history. Under German occupation, the Netherlands had little ability to defend its colony against the Japanese army, and less than three months after the first attacks on Borneo,[1] the Japanese navy and army overran Dutch and allied forces. Initially, most Indonesians joyfully welcomed the Japanese, as liberators from their Dutch colonial masters. The sentiment changed, as Indonesians were expected to endure more hardship for the war effort. In 19441945, Allied troops largely bypassed Indonesia and did not fight their way into the most populous parts such as Java and Sumatra. As such, most of Indonesia was still under Japanese occupation at the time of their surrender, in August 1945.\n\nThe occupation was the first serious challenge to the Dutch in Indonesia and ended the Dutch colonial rule, and, by its end, changes were so numerous and extraordinary that the subsequent watershed, the Indonesian National Revolution, was possible in a manner unfeasible just three years earlier. Unlike the Dutch, the Japanese facilitated the politicisation of Indonesians down to the village level. Particularly in Java and, to a lesser extent, Sumatra, the Japanese educated, trained and armed many young Indonesians and gave their nationalist leaders a political voice. Thus, through both the destruction of the Dutch colonial regime and the facilitation of Indonesian nationalism, the Japanese occupation created the conditions for claiming Indonesian independence within days of the Japanese surrender in the Pacific. However, the Netherlands sought to reclaim the Indies, and a bitter five-year diplomatic, military and social struggle ensued, resulting in the Netherlands recognising Indonesian sovereignty in December 1949.\n\nUntil 1942, Indonesia was colonised by the Netherlands and was known as the Dutch East Indies. In 1929, during the Indonesian National Awakening, Indonesian nationalist leaders Sukarno and Mohammad Hatta (later founding President and Vice-President), foresaw a Pacific War and that a Japanese advance on Indonesia might be advantageous for the independence cause.\n\nThe Japanese spread the word that they were the \'Light of Asia\'. Japan was the only Asian nation that had successfully transformed itself into a modern technological society at the end of the 19th century and it remained independent when most Asian countries had been under European or American power, and had beaten a European power, Russia, in war. Following its military campaign in China Japan turned its attention to Southeast Asia advocating to other Asians a \'Greater East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere\', which they described as a type of trade zone under Japanese leadership. The Japanese had gradually spread their influence through Asia in the first half of the 20th century and during the 1920s and 1930s had established business links in the Indies. These ranged from small town barbers, photographic studios and salesmen, to large department stores and firms such as Suzuki and Mitsubishi becoming involved in the sugar trade.\n\nThe Japanese population peaked in 1931, with 6,949 residents before starting a gradual decrease, largely due to economic tensions between Japan and the Netherlands Indies government.[6] A number of Japanese had been sent by their government to establish links with Indonesian nationalists, particularly with Muslim parties, while Indonesian nationalists were sponsored to visit Japan. Such encouragement of Indonesian nationalism was part of a broader Japanese plan for an \'Asia for the Asians\'. While most Indonesians were hopeful for the Japanese promise of an end to the Dutch racially based system, Chinese Indonesians, who enjoyed a privileged position under Dutch rule, were less optimistic. Also concerned were members of the Indonesian communist underground who followed the Soviet Union\'s popular united front against fascism. Japanese aggression in Manchuria and China in the late 1930s caused anxiety amongst the Chinese in Indonesia who set up funds to support the anti-Japanese effort. Dutch intelligence services also monitored Japanese living in Indonesia.\n\nIn November 1941, Madjlis Rakjat Indonesia, an Indonesian organisation of religious, political and trade union groups, submitted a memorandum to the Dutch East Indies Government requesting the mobilisation of the Indonesian people in the face of the war threat.[9] The memorandum was refused because the Government did not consider the Madjlis Rakyat Indonesia to be representative of the people. Within only four months, the Japanese had occupied the archipelago.\n\nOn 8 December 1941, the Netherlands declared war on Japan.[10] In January the American-British-Dutch-Australian Command (ABDACOM) was formed to co-ordinate Allied forces in South East Asia, under the command of General Archibald Wavell.[11] In the weeks leading up to the invasion, senior Dutch government officials went into exile taking political prisoners, family, and personal staff to Australia. Before the arrival of Japanese troops, there were conflicts between rival Indonesian groups where people were killed, vanished or went into hiding. Chinese- and Dutch-owned properties were ransacked and destroyed.[12]\n\nThe invasion in early 1942 was swift and complete. By January 1942, parts of Sulawesi and Kalimantan were under Japanese control. By February, the Japanese had landed on Sumatra where they had encouraged the Acehnese to rebel against the Dutch. On 19 February, having already taken Ambon, the Japanese Eastern Task Force landed in Timor, dropping a special parachute unit into West Timor near Kupang, and landing in the Dili area of Portuguese Timor to drive out the Allied forces which had invaded in December.[14] On 27 February, the Allied navy\'s last effort to contain Japan was swept aside by their defeat in the Battle of the Java Sea.[15] From 28 February to 1 March 1942, Japanese troops landed on four places along the northern coast of Java almost undisturbed.[16] The fiercest fighting had been in invasion points in Ambon, Timor, Kalimantan, and on the Java Sea. In places where there were no Dutch troops, such as Bali, there was no fighting.[17] On 9 March, the Dutch commander surrendered along with Governor General Jonkheer A.W.L. Tjarda van Starkenborgh Stachouwer.\n\nThe Japanese occupation was initially greeted with optimistic enthusiasm by Indonesians who came to meet the Japanese army waving flags and shouting support such as \"Japan is our older brother\" and \"banzai Dai Nippon\". As the Japanese advanced, rebellious Indonesians in virtually every part of the archipelago killed groups of Europeans (particularly the Dutch) and informed the Japanese reliably on the whereabouts of larger groups.[18] As famed Indonesian writer Pramoedya Ananta Toer noted: \"With the arrival of the Japanese just about everyone was full of hope, except for those who had worked in the service of the Dutch.[19]\"\n\nThe colonial army was consigned to detention camps and Indonesian soldiers were released.[citation needed] Expecting that Dutch administrators would be kept by the Japanese to run the colony, most Dutch had refused to leave. Instead, they were sent to concentration camps and Japanese or Indonesian replacements were installed in senior and technical positions. Japanese troops took control of government infrastructure and services such as ports and postal services.[17] In addition to the 100,000 European (and some Chinese) civilians interned, 80,000 Dutch, British, Australia, and US Allied troops went to prisoner-of-war camps where the death rates were between 13 and 30 per cent.\n\nThe Indonesian ruling class (composed of local officials and politicians who had formerly worked for the Dutch colonial government) co-operated with the Japanese military authorities, who in turn helped to keep the local political elites in power and employ them to supply newly-arrived Japanese industrial concerns and businesses and the armed forces (chiefly auxiliary military and police units run by the Japanese military in the Dutch East Indies). Indonesian co-operation allowed the Japanese military government to focus on securing the large archipelago\'s waterways and skies and using its islands as defence posts against any Allied attacks (which were assumed to most likely come from Australia).[21] The Japanese colonial rulers divided Indonesia into three separate regions; Sumatra was placed under the 25th Army, Java and Madura were under the 16th Army, while Borneo and eastern Indonesia were controlled by the 2nd South Fleet of the Imperial Japanese Navy (the IJN). The 16th Army and the 25th Army were headquartered in Singapore and also controlled Malaya until April 1943, when its command was narrowed to just Sumatra and the headquarters moved to Bukittinggi. The 16th Army was headquartered in Jakarta, while the IJN\'s 2nd South Fleet was headquartered in Makassar.\n\nExperience of the occupation varied considerably, depending upon where one lived and one\'s social position. Many who lived in areas considered important to the war effort experienced torture, sex slavery, arbitrary arrest and execution, and other war crimes. Many thousands of people were taken away from Indonesia as forced labourers (romusha) for Japanese military projects, including the Burma-Siam and Saketi-Bayah railways, and suffered or died as a result of ill-treatment and starvation. Between four and 10 million romusha in Java were forced to work by the Japanese military.[22] About 270,000 of these Javanese labourers were sent to other Japanese-held areas in South East Asia, Only 52,000 were repatriated to Java, meaning that there was a death rate of 80%.\n\nTens of thousands of Indonesians were to starve, work as slave labourers, or be forced from their homes. In the National Revolution that followed, tens, even hundreds, of thousands, would die in fighting against the Japanese, Allied forces, and other Indonesians, before Independence was achieved. A later United Nations report stated that four million people died in Indonesia as a result of famine and forced labour during the Japanese occupation, including 30,000 European civilian internee deaths.[25] A Dutch government study described how the Japanese military recruited women as prostitutes by force in Indonesia.[26] It concluded that among the 200 to 300 European women working in the Japanese military brothels, \"some sixty five were most certainly forced into prostitution.\" [27] Others, faced with starvation in the refugee camps, agreed to offers of food and payment for work, the nature of which was not completely revealed to them.[28][29][30][31][32]\n\nMaterially, whole railway lines, railway rolling stock, and industrial plants in Java were appropriated and shipped back to Japan and Manchuria. British intelligence reports during the occupation noted significant removals of any materials that could be used in the war effort.\n\nNext to Sutan Sjahrir who led the student (Pemuda) underground, the only prominent opposition politician was leftist Amir Sjarifuddin who was given 25,000 guilders by the Dutch in early 1942 to organise an underground resistance through his Marxist and nationalist connections. The Japanese arrested Amir in 1943, and he only escaped execution following intervention from Sukarno, whose popularity in Indonesia and hence importance to the war effort was recognised by the Japanese. Apart from Amir\'s Surabaya-based group, the most active pro-Allied activities were among the Chinese, Ambonese, and Manadonese.[33]\n\nIn South Kalimantan, a scheme by Indonesian nationalists and Dutch against the Japanese was uncovered before the Pontianak incident occurred.[34] According to some sources this happened in September 1943 at Amuntai in South Kalimantan and involved establishing up an Islamic State and expelling the Japanese but the plan was defeated.[35][36]\n\nIn 1943 the Japanese beheaded Tengku Rachmadu\'llah, a member of the royal family of the Sultanate of Serdang.[37] In the 19431944 Pontianak incidents (also known as the Mandor Affair), the Japanese orchestrated a mass arrest of Malay elites and Arabs, Chinese, Javanese, Manadonese, Dayaks, Bugis, Bataks, Minangkabau, Dutch, Indians, and Eurasians in Kalimantan, including all of the Malay Sultans, accused them of plotting to overthrow Japanese rule, and then massacred them.[38][39] The Japanese falsely claimed that all of those ethnic groups and organisations such as the Islamic Pemuda Muhammadijah were involved in a plot to overthrow the Japanese and create a \"People\'s Republic of West Borneo\" (Negara Rakyat Borneo Barat).[40] The Japanese claimed that- \"Sultans, Chinese, Indonesian government officials, Indians and Arabs, who had been antagonistic to each other, joined together to massacre Japanese.\", naming the Sultan of the Pontianak Sultanate as one of the \"ringleaders\" in the planned rebellion.[41] Up to 25 aristocrats, relatives of the Sultan of Pontianak, and many other prominent individuals were named as participants in the plot by the Japanese and then executed at Mandor.[42][43] The Sultans of Pontianak, Sambas, Ketapang, Soekadana, Simbang, Koeboe, Ngabang, Sanggau, Sekadau, Tajan, Singtan, and Mempawa were all executed by the Japanese, respectively, their names were Sjarif Mohamed Alkadri, Mohamad Ibrahim Tsafidedin, Goesti Saoenan, Tengkoe Idris, Goesti Mesir, Sjarif Saleh, Goesti Abdoel Hamid, Ade Mohamad Arif, Goesti Mohamad Kelip, Goesti Djapar, Raden Abdul Bahri Danoe Perdana, and Mohammed Ahoufiek.[44] They are known as the \"12 Dokoh\".[45] In Java, the Japanese jailed Syarif Abdul Hamid Alqadrie, the son of Sultan Syarif Mohamad Alkadrie (Sjarif Mohamed Alkadri).[46] Since he was in Java during the executions Hamid II was the only male in his family not killed, while the Japanese beheaded all 28 other male relatives of Pontianak Sultan Mohammed Alkadri.[47] Among the 29 people of the Sultan of Pontianak\'s family who were beheaded by the Japanese was the heir to the Pontianak throne.[48] Later in 1944, the Dayaks assassinated a Japanese man named Nakatani, who was involved in the incident and who was known for his cruelty. Sultan of Pontianak Mohamed Alkadri\'s fourth son, Pengeran Agoen (Pangeran Agung), and another son, Pengeran Adipati (Pangeran Adipati), were both killed by the Japanese in the incident.[49] The Japanese had beheaded both Pangeran Adipati and Pangeran Agung,[50] in a public execution.[51] The Japanese extermination of the Malay elite of Pontianak paved the way for a new Dayak elite to arise in its place.[52] According to Mary F. Somers Heidhues, during May and June 1945, some Japanese were killed in a rebellion by the Dayaks in Sanggau.[53] According to Jamie S. Davidson, this rebellion, during which many Dayaks and Japanese were killed, occurred from April through August 1945, and was called the \"Majang Desa War\".[54] The Pontianak Incidents, or Affairs, are divided into two Pontianak incidents by scholars, variously categorised according to mass killings and arrests, which occurred in several stages on different dates. The Pontianak incident negatively impacted the Chinese community in Kalimantan.[55][56][57][58][59]\n\nThe Acehnese Ulama (Islamic clerics) fought against both the Dutch and the Japanese, revolting against the Dutch in February 1942 and against Japan in November 1942. The revolt was led by the All-Aceh Religious Scholars\' Association ( PUSA). The Japanese suffered 18 dead in the uprising while they slaughtered up to 100 or over 120 Acehnese.[35][60] The revolt happened in Bayu and was centred around Tjot Plieng village\'s religious school.[61][62][63][64] During the revolt, the Japanese troops armed with mortars and machine guns were charged by sword wielding Acehnese under Teungku Abduldjalil (Tengku Abdul Djalil) in Buloh Gampong Teungah and Tjot Plieng on 10 and 13 November.[65][66][67][68][69][70][71] In May 1945 the Acehnese rebelled again.[72]\n\nIn the decades before the war, the Dutch had been overwhelmingly successful in suppressing the small nationalist movement in Indonesia such that the Japanese proved fundamental for coming Indonesian independence. During the occupation, the Japanese encouraged and backed Indonesian nationalistic sentiments, created new Indonesian institutions, and promoted nationalist leaders such as Sukarno. The openness now provided to Indonesian nationalism, combined with the Japanese destruction of much of the Dutch colonial state, were fundamental to the Indonesian National Revolution that followed World War 2.\n\nNonetheless within two months of the occupation the Japanese did not allow the political use of the word Indonesia as the name for a nation, neither did they allow the use of the nationalistic (red and white) Indonesian flag. In fact \"any discussion, organisation, speculation or propaganda concerning the political organisation or government of the country\" (also in the media) was strictly forbidden. They split up the Dutch East Indies into three separate regions and referred to it as the \'Southern Territories\' (Indonesian: Daerah Selatan). While Tokyo prepared the Philippines for independence in 1943, they simultaneously decided to annex the Indonesian islands into the greater Japanese Empire. Until late 1944 when the Pacific war was at a turning point the Japanese never seriously supported Indonesian independence.[73]\n\nThe Japanese regime perceived Java as the most politically sophisticated but economically the least important area; its people were Japan\'s main resource. As suchand in contrast to Dutch suppressionthe Japanese encouraged Indonesian nationalism in Java and thus increased its political sophistication (similar encouragement of nationalism in strategic resource-rich Sumatra came later, but only after it was clear the Japanese would lose the war). The outer islands under naval control, however, were regarded as politically backward but economically vital for the Japanese war effort, and these regions were governed the most oppressively of all. These experiences and subsequent differences in nationalistic politicisation would have profound impacts on the course of the Indonesian Revolution in the years immediately following independence (19451950).\n\nTo gain support and mobilise Indonesian people in their war effort against the Western Allied force, Japanese occupation forces encouraged Indonesian nationalistic movements and recruiting Indonesian nationalist leaders; Sukarno, Hatta, Ki Hajar Dewantara and Kyai Haji Mas Mansyur to rally the people support for mobilisation centre Putera (Indonesian: Pusat Tenaga Rakyat) on 16 April 1943, replaced with Jawa Hokokai on 1 March 1944. Some of these mobilised populations were sent to forced labour as romusha.\n\nJapanese military also provided Indonesian youth with military trainings and weapons, including the formation of volunteer army called PETA (Pembela Tanah Air Defenders of the Homeland). The Japanese military trainings for Indonesian youth originally was meant to rally the local\'s support for the collapsing power of Japanese Empire, but later it has become the significant resource for Republic of Indonesia during Indonesian National Revolution in 1945 to 1949, and also has leads to the formation of Indonesian National Armed Forces in 1945.\n\nOn 29 April 1945, Japanese occupation force formed BPUPKI (Indonesian Independence Effort Exploratory Committee) (Japanese: , Dokuritsu Junbi Chsakai), a Japanese-organized committee for granting independence to Indonesia. The organisation was founded on 29 April 1945 by Lt. Gen. Kumakichi Harada, the commander of 16th Army in Java. Indonesian independence meeting and discussion were prepared through this organisation.\n\nIn addition to new-found Indonesian nationalism, equally important for the coming independence struggle and internal revolution was the Japanese orchestrated economic, political and social dismantling and destruction of the Dutch colonial state.\n\nGeneral MacArthur wanted to fight his way with Allied troops to liberate Java in 194445 but was ordered not to by the joint chiefs and President Roosevelt. The Japanese occupation thus officially ended with Japanese surrender in the Pacific and two days later Sukarno declared Indonesian Independence. However Indonesian forces would spend the next four years fighting the Dutch for independence. American restraint from fighting their way into Java certainly saved many Japanese, Javanese, Dutch and American lives. On the other hand, Indonesian independence would have likely been achieved more swiftly and smoothly had MacArthur had his way and American troops occupied Java. A later UN report stated that four million people died in Indonesia as a result of the Japanese occupation.[75] About 2.4 million people died in Java from famine during 194445.[76]\n\nLiberation of the internment camps holding western prisoners was not swift. Conditions were better during post-war internment than under previous internment, for, this time, Red Cross supplies were made available and the Allies made the Japanese order the most heinous and cruel occupiers home. After four months of post-war internment, Western internees were released on the condition they left Indonesia.[citation needed]\n\nMost of the Japanese military personnel and civilian colonial administrators were repatriated to Japan following the war, although the process took nearly a year for most individuals, and often two years or more. Following screening for war crimes, physical labor or security duty for thousands more, and war crimes trials for approximately 1,038 individuals, they were sent back to Japan aboard remaining Japanese vessels. Approximately 1,000 Japanese soldiers deserted from their units (then under allied command) and assimilated themselves into local communities. Many of these soldiers joined the TNI or other Indonesian military organizations, and a number of these former Japanese soldiers died during the Indonesian National Revolution, including the famous Abdul Rachman (Ichiki Tatsuo).[77][78][79][80]\n\nThe final stages of warfare were initiated in October 1945 when, in accordance with the terms of their surrender, the Japanese tried to re-establish the authority they relinquished to Indonesians in the towns and cities. Japanese military police killed Republican pemuda in Pekalongan (Central Java) on 3 October, and Japanese troops drove Republican pemuda out of Bandung in West Java and handed the city to the British, but the fiercest fighting involving the Japanese was in Semarang. On 14 October, British forces began to occupy the city. Retreating Republican forces retaliated by killing between 130 and 300 Japanese prisoners they were holding. Five hundred Japanese and 2000 Indonesians had been killed and the Japanese had almost captured the city six days later when British forces arrived.\n\nUntil 1949, the returning Dutch authorities held 448 war crimes trials against 1038 suspects. 969 of those were condemned (93.4%) with 236 (24.4%) receiving a death sentence.[83]','2017-03-25 03:51:14'),(662,87,'d1d554d4ba731a619e224ec4ddba65d63b542403e990d9c916150522e3dcc7f3','132f4544939c4987a87f4fc0965984c7','','','\'It felt as if he were completely gone,\' the actress confesses.','2017-03-25 03:51:14'),(663,87,'d1d554d4ba731a619e224ec4ddba65d63b542403e990d9c916150522e3dcc7f3','1f28dfbdb20c4773a14d5b91784f1b41','','','News of politician George W.

Bush, the 43rd president of the United States, died today at Methodist Hospital in Houston, Texas. He was 72. The cause of death was announced as heart failure.\n\nMr. Bushs always controversial presidency left behind a changed nation and a changed world. Taking office in 2001 after a disputed election settled only by a 5-4 decision by a bitterly divided Supreme Court, and decisively reelected in 2004, President Bush led the United States into four wars, oversaw the dismantling of Social Security and Medicare, and enforced a drastic shrinking of elementary, secondary, and collegiate education. He spearheaded the transformation of President Bill Clintons budget surpluses of 1999 and 2000 into permanent deficits of more than a trillion dollars a year, thus profoundly reducing the amount of capital available to address the needs of the vast majority of citizens and inhibiting the creation of new jobs with any promise of advancement or financial security, while at the same time pursuing tax reductions that increased the differences between the income and assets of, in his own terminology, owners and pre-owners of the American ownership society to extremes almost beyond measure. When he left office, taxation of personal and corporate incomes, while still legally extant, had been effectively replaced by a new payroll tax, so that almost all investment, inheritance, and interest income was left tax-free. Those with the greatest stake in America, President Bush often said throughout his second term, have the greatest stake in defending it. Thus we as a nation must do all that we can to ensure that the commitment of those with the greatest stake to the rest of us, a commitment on which our freedom and security rests, only grows greater.\n\nAdding to Mr. Bushs statutory and administrative economic policies were a series of decisions by the Bush Court, as the Supreme Court was known after 2005, when in that year Mr. Bush replaced three retiring members with very conservative justices (a fourth was replaced in 2006), depriving government regulation of corporations and the environment of any legal basisdecisions which many analysts considered more significant than the repudiation by the Bush Court of previous decisions upholding a womans right to privacy in the matter of abortion and certain applications of affirmative action. Even with the Bush Court seated, however, the Republican-controlled Congress that Mr. Bush enjoyed throughout his presidency repeatedly passed legislation removing issue after issue from the purview of the state and federal courts, including questions of freedom of speech, freedom of the press, the right to assemble, and the right to trial by jury. Despite these prohibitions of judicial review, the government, under Mr. Bush, did not press for any legislation curtailing what had previously been referred to as First Amendment freedoms, but simply refrained from challenging such legislation passed by many states, rather filing supportive briefs before the Supreme Court when such measures were contested. Ultimately the reversal of the series of 20th-century Supreme Court decisions subjecting the states to the Bill of Rights, long-sought by certain conservatives, was achieved not de jure but de facto. The press is legally free, the former New York Times columnist Frank Rich put it in 2007, writing in his online journal Thatsrichbrother.com. It merely refrains from practicing freedom. Some said the same of the nation as a whole; others said the country was freer than it had ever been.\n\nMr. Bush was born in New Haven, Connecticut, on July 6, 1946, and raised in Houston and Midland, Texas, where his father, the former President George H. W. Bush, began his careers in oil and politics. Mr. Bush attended Andover Academy and graduated from Yale University in 1968. During the Vietnam War he was a member of the Texas Air National Guard, known at the time as a safe haven from combat duty; whether Mr. Bush did in fact fulfill his military obligations became a subject of dispute during his second election campaign. In 1975 Mr. Bush graduated from Harvard Business School and began careers in oil and politics in Texas; neither flourished. Though he married the former Laura Welch in 1977 and fathered twin daughters Jenna (named for Mrs. Bushs mother) and Barbara (named for Mr. Bushs mother) in 1981, Mr. Bushs life through his early 40s was characterized by business failures, accusations of insider trading, reports of silent bailouts, and self-confessed drinking. (Mr. Bush claimed to have renounced drinkingthe word alcoholism was never usedthe day after his 40th birthday, as the result of divine intervention and an act of will.) He became a public figure in 1989 when, through a questioned investment, he became part of the consortium that bought the Texas Rangers baseball franchise; his title as managing partner produced an impression of competence and good humor. In 1994 Mr. Bush ran for governor of Texas and proved himself a first-rate campaigner. When he was elected, Texas was a bipartisan state; as Mr. Bushs advisor Karl Rove once said, He charmed Democrats into riding on his strong back as he forded the river of discord. When Mr. Bush left office as president, the Texas government was all Republican.\n\nMr. Bush was a politician opponents underestimated at their peril, and throughout his career his opponents did just that. He cultivated an aura of know-nothingness, of a fine disregard of inconvenient facts or opinions, but he was devastating on the attack, able to present himself as an ordinary man outraged by the self-superiority of whoever might be opposing him at any time and on any issue. Even as president, before the al Qaeda terrorist attacks on Washington, D.C., and New York City, in 2001, he was not always taken seriously by political commentators or the public at large; after that event he became a heroic figure, standing in defense of the United States as if that historic responsibility were his alone.\n\nHe launched an assault against Afghanistan, where al Qaeda had its headquarters and training grounds, weeks after the 2001 attacks, leading to the immediate fall of the totalitarian Islamic regime of the Taliban, which had given al Qaeda sanctuary. Though Osama bin Laden, the leader of the worldwide Islamist movement, escaped capture, his forces were severely weakened and scattered; during Mr. Bushs first term there was, against all expectations and predictions, no further terrorist attack on American soil. Arguing that Saddam Husseins government in Iraq was a center of terrorist plotting and a repository of terrorist weaponry, from what turned out to be nonexistent chemical and biological arms to equally chimerical nuclear technology, Mr. Bush in 2003 led a limited international coalition into Iraq and replaced Mr. Hussein with an occupying force, which over the next year was pushed back into consistently shrinking enclaves in the face of a fierce insurgency. Following his reelection in 2004, Mr. Bush ordered the destruction of the cities where the insurgents were thought to be concentrated; though the cities were destroyed, the insurgency continued. Mr. Bush then pressed on to Iran and North Korea, which he had identified as rogue states.\n\nWith U.S. Armed Forces tied down in Iraq, Mr. Bush turned to what critics called a private army subject to no law and operating at the whim of a single individualthat is, to large numbers of private contractors employed by U. S., Serbian, Nigerian, and Saudi corporationsto launch land, sea, and air attacks meant to destroy nuclear facilities in both Iran and North Korea. While the Afghan and Iraqi armies and governments had collapsed almost at the first sign of American assault, the Iranian and North Korean invasions were beaten back by sustained resistance and, in North Korea, the use of explosives that Mr. Bush denounced as tactical nuclear weapons, though this was later proved not to be the case. Nonetheless Mr. Bush then ordered what he described as pinpoint nuclear attacks on the nuclear sites in Iran and North Korea, which, while achieving their goals, also led to the One-Day War, a nuclear exchange between India and Pakistan that left Bombay and Karachi in ruins and led to the fall of the governments of both countries, and to the withdrawal of the American-led coalition forces from Iraq. The result was the series of still-continuing civil wars throughout the Middle East and the Indian subcontinent that, while involving no unconventional weapons since 2006 have, according to the United Nations, caused the deaths of 12 million people and the displacement of millions more. Mr. Bushs claim in action if not in words that the United States retained an international monopoly on the legitimate use of force left allies such as Great Britain and alliances such as NATO crippled; it also left the United States at least formally unchallenged.\n\nIt was often said, during Mr. Bushs first term, that he saw himself as a messianic figure, ordained by God to carry the flag of freedom (Gods gift, in Mr. Bushs words, to every individual) to the corners of the earth, and that the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, at least, were part of a crusade of transcendent significance. After Mr. Bushs reelection, it was increasingly argued that his wars were a diversionary and obfuscatory tactic meant to raise Mr. Bushs standing, and the power of the Republican Party both in Congress and in the states, solely for the benefit of Mr. Bushs domestic agenda, and that, as the poet Donald Hall wrote, it was the United States itself that was the true object of conquest. While that is a matter for history to settle (when, as Mr. Bush himself once put it, well all be dead), few would dispute that Mr. Bush left the United States if not conquered then irrevocably changedand, according to the American novelist Philip Roth, who in 2008, cited by the Swedish Academy as the voice of a lost republic, was awarded the Nobel Prize for literature, less a nation governed by its citizenry, where each of us has one vote, than a stock exchange owned by its shareholders, according to the number of their shares.\n\nMr. Bushs Republican Party had, during his time in office, so effectively marginalized the opposition Democratic Party that it all but ceased to function in many states. After the suspension of the filibuster rule in the U.S. Senate, the remaining 45 Democratic senators were unable to block any of Mr. Bushs appointments to the federal courts or the executive branch of government. The Republicans had so successfully supported Mr. Bush as an infallible and irreplaceable leader that he came to seem, in fact, irreplaceable. There was no figure in the party who did not appear diminished as soon as his or her name was mentioned alongside of his, and the notion of any ordinary Republican actually succeeding Mr. Bush became, in the words of William Kristol, editor of the conservative journal the Daily Standard, unthinkable. Thus was the strategy devised to introduce a constitutional amendment to remove the requirement in Article 1 that no one could be elected president were he or she not native born, supposedly to permit the presidential candidacy of the native-born Austrian Arnold Schwarzenegger, the enormously popular and skillful governor of California and the one Republican other than Mr. Bush who did sometimes appear larger than life. It later transpired that the amendment was a ruse: When Democrats attempted to poison the amendment by proposing that all restrictions on who might become president be removed (the requirement that a president be at least 35 years old, the two-term limit), the Republicans immediately acquiesced, and as a result of the passage of the 28th Amendment in 2006 and its ratification by the states the next year, in 2008 Mr. Bush announced his candidacy for a third term. He was overwhelmingly defeated that November by former President Bill Clinton.\n\nMr. Bushs life after his presidency was marked by misfortune. He soon lost interest in his status as the standard-bearer of his party and its chief fundraiser; many believed he had again begun drinking, and in any case he seemed to spend most of his time at private clubs in Houston, where he established residence in 2010 after selling his property in Crawford, Texas. (At least I wont have to cut that f brush again, Mr. Bush was heard to say after his last election.) Then on May 1, 2011, Jenna and Barbara Bush were killed in a drunken driving accident in New York City, an incident that also took the lives of seven other people, four of them friends of the Bush daughters. Rumors that a Bush family friend attempted to bribe the police to report that a person other than Jenna or Barbara Bush was driving (the body of Barbara Bush was in the drivers seat) were never confirmed. Four years later, in 2015, Laura Bush, like her father, died of Parkinsons disease; she was 68. After a period of mourning, Mr. Bush announced that, to find his way back into productive service and do Gods will, he would welcome the opportunity to act as commissioner of baseball. But while Commissioner Bud Selig said that he would be honored to yield the position to Mr. Bush, he cautioned that the exigencies of the job would probably require him to remain in office for another year, or maybe two, and the question was not raised again.\n\nMr. Bush was preceded in death by his sister Robin Bush, his brothers John Jeb Bush, the former governor of Florida, Neil Bush, and Marvin Bush, and his sister Dorothy Bush Koch. He is survived by his parents.','2017-03-25 03:51:14'),(666,87,'d1d554d4ba731a619e224ec4ddba65d63b542403e990d9c916150522e3dcc7f3','144bf7e9b9824f1894f9c661b42b3fa7','','','Before you go, we thought you\'d like these...\n\nPresident George H.

The most recent John Cena death hoax came in 2015, but the hoax that gained the most notoriety came in 2013.\n\nA previous John Cena death hoax claimed that the wrestling superstar had died of a head injury that he suffered when he was practicing a stunt with Dwayne Johnson. At the time of the rumor, Hoax-Slayer.com debunked the rumor, indicating that the hoax was an effort to gain clicks on malicious links via Facebook.\n\nThough Snopes reports that Cena has not spoken out about the most recent death rumors, it should be noted that 39-year-old has been active on his social media accounts within the past 24 hours.

I dont have time to be politically correct, is practically his slogan. Accused at the debate of insulting a Miss Universe winner for gaining weight, afterwards he made no apologies: She was the worst we ever had  she gained a massive amount of weight and it was a real problem.\n\nBut there was one thing he previously said that he ran as far away from as possible during the debate: global warming is a hoax.\n\nWhen Hillary Clinton said, Donald thinks that climate change is a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese. I think its real, Trump immediately interjected, I did not. I did not. I do not say that.\n\nOf course, he has called global warming a hoax on multiple occasions.

But this is done for the benefit of China because China does not do anything to help climate change.\n\nBut even Trump knows that admitting you think global warming is a hoax, in front of 80 million people, is political suicide.\n\nThis doesnt mean Trump has gotten religion about the science, or a grasp of the facts. He proceeded to knock the Obama administrations record on renewable energy: She talks about solar panels. We invested in a solar company, our country. That was a disaster. They lost plenty of money on that one. Now, look, Im a great believer in all forms of energy, but were putting a lot of people out of work.

Likewise, herproposed policiestake measures to combat climate change.\n\nBelow well outline the candidates stances and claims aboutclimate change generally, and specific related topics, including: extreme weather, the Paris Agreement, the Clean Power Plan, a carbon tax, fracking, renewable energy and green buildings.\n\nIn doing so, well explain how each ticket plans (or plans not) to combat what the American Association for the Advancement of Science calls a growing threat to society.\n\nDuring all threepresidential election debates, which totaled 4.5hours,less than six minutes was spent discussing the candidatespolicies related toclimate change.\n\nBut their differences on the subjectare fundamental: Trump claims climatechange is a hoax, and Clinton saysits real.\n\nIn addition to his remarksin Hilton Head, Trump also has called global warming a hoax and bullshit via Twitter.\n\nAs Clinton rightly pointed out during the first presidential debate, Trumpalso tweeted back in 2012: The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive.\n\nTrumps denial of climate change has also led him to make false claims.\n\nFor example,on July 26, 2016, Trump told Bill OReilly at Fox News that people at the Copenhagen conference in 2009were sending out emails, scientists practically calling it a hoax, and they were laughing at it, adding that thats why heprobably did call climate change a hoax.\n\nTrump is referring to the Climategate scandal, which weve written about before. This controversy involvedleaked emails and other documents of climate researchers at the University of East Anglia in England in November 2009, less than a month before the Copenhagen climate conference.\n\nThe researchers did not call climate change a hoax in these emails. Climate skeptics claimed at the time that the emails revealed how climate scientists deliberately destroyed records, manipulated data to hide the decline in global temperatures, and tried to silence their critics by preventing them from publishing in peer-reviewed journals, as former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palinwrote in a Dec. 9, 2009,Washington Post op-ed.\n\nHowever, as we wrote in April 2010,an independent international investigation set up by theUniversity of East Angliafound no such wrongdoing or manipulation.We saw no evidence of any deliberate scientific malpractice in any of the work of the Climatic Research Unit and had it been there we believe that it is likely that we would have detected it, the investigative report said.\n\nAlthough he has denied the existence of climate change as a candidate, Trump has taken the position that global warming is real as a businessman.\n\nPolitico reportedin May that Trump International Golf Links Ireland applied for a permit to build a sea wall to protect theIrish golf course from global warming and its effects. The permit explicitly cites global warming and its consequences  increased erosion due to rising sea levels and extreme weather this century  as a chief justification for building the structure, Politico adds.\n\nClinton, on the other hand, has consistently claimed she believes climate change is real, as she did during the first presidential debate.\n\nScientificevidence supports Clintons position that human-caused climate change is real. The latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report states that human changes to the planet, especiallythe emissions of greenhouse gases from the burning of fossil fuels, are extremely likely to have been the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century.\n\nHuman-caused climate change is also considered realaccording to 97 percent of climate scientists, as weve written.\n\nMultiple studies published in peer-reviewed scientific journals show that 97 percent or more of actively publishing climate scientists agree: Climate-warming trends over the past century are extremely likely due to human activities, says NASA.\n\nAteam of more than 300 expertsat theU.S. Global Change research program are among that 97 percent.\n\nThe burning of coal, oil, and gas, and clearing of forests have increased the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere by more than 40% since the Industrial Revolution, and it has been known for almost two centuries that this carbon dioxide traps heat, the team explains in the Third National Climate Assessment report. The report adds, Multiple lines of independent evidence confirm that [these] human activities are the primary cause of the global warming of the past 50 years.\n\nWe always have had extreme weather such as destructive hurricanes, but scientists say global warming is expected to increase the magnitude and probability of cyclones, or hurricanes, and other extreme weather events.\n\nBut the level of certainty scientists have for each type of extreme weather event differs, a 2016 report by the National Academies of the Sciences explains. Differentconfidence levels result fromthe capabilities of climate models, the quality and length of the observational record, and the understanding of physical mechanisms pertaining tospecific extreme weather events.\n\nA rule of thumb: The more removed a type of event is from temperature changes, the less confident scientists are when tying that type of event to human-induced global warming.\n\nFor example, scientists are most confident whenlinking human-caused climate change to extreme heat and cold waves. These are weather events thatdirectly relate to temperature change, and scientists have the bestmodels, observational record and understanding of the physics behind these events, the report explains.\n\nOn the other hand, scientists have medium confidence when attributing droughts and extreme rainfall to climate change. Heavy rainfall, for example, is influenced by a moister atmosphere, which is a relatively direct consequence of human-induced warming, though not as direct as the increase in temperature itself, the report says.\n\nIts more difficult still to tie the frequency and intensity of tropical cyclones, or hurricanes, to climate change, the report adds. These storms are less directly related to changes in temperature.Scientists have less data on hurricanes of the past, which reduces their ability to make solid claims about long-term trends. But they do have some understanding of the physical mechanisms behind climate change that could bring about these storms.\n\nNew modeling techniques also have improved scientistsconfidence when attributing cyclone activity to climate change. Tropical cyclones are projected to become more intense as the climate warms. There is considerable confidence in this conclusion, as it is found in a wide range of numerical models, the report authors write.\n\nAs we explained in April 2015, the 2014 IPCC report points out that confidence when attributing tropical cyclones to human-caused climate change also differs by region. For example, there is evidence for a virtually certain  which means between 99 percent and 100 percent probability  increase in the frequency and intensity of the strongest tropical cyclones since the 1970s in the North Atlantic basin, we wrote.\n\nAll of these extreme weather changes will continue to affect human health, water supply, agriculture, transportation, energy, coastal areas, and many other sectors of society, with increasingly adverse impacts on the American economy and quality of life, experts on the U.S. Global Change research program say.\n\nLike their claims on the reality of climate change, Trump and Clintons positions on the Paris Agreement are poles apart.\n\nThe Paris Agreementaims to unify global efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions such that global temperature rise stays well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.\n\nAmong other policies, Trumps America First Energy Plan includes canceling the Paris Agreement and stopping all payments of U.S. tax dollars to U.N. global warming programs.\n\nTrump also claimed that the Paris agreement gives foreign bureaucrats control over  how much [energy] we use right here in America. Thats false.Each country determines its own emission reduction targets.\n\nTrump could abandon U.S. involvement in the Paris deal in several ways, legal experts told Climate Central, an environmental news website.\n\nOne option would be for Trump to wait until the very end of his first term to formally withdraw. The agreement will go into effect on Nov. 4, just four days before Election Day. After that, each country has to wait four years before officially pulling out of the deal.\n\nBut countries arent penalized for failing to adhere to their proposed emission cuts, as these nationally determined emission cuts are voluntary. As a result, the international agreement couldnt prevent Trump from proceeding with his plan to rescind Obamas Climate Action Plan, approvethe Keystone Pipeline and revoke unwarranted restrictions on new drilling technologies if elected president, for example.\n\nSo Trump could also ignore the deal altogether. As the BBC reports, U.S. climate inaction could influence other major emitters, like China and India, to pull back on meeting their own emission reduction promises.\n\nLast, Trump could potentially withdraw the U.S. from the 1992 U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change without approval from Congress with only one years notice, experts told Climate Central. According to the Paris deal, this would also withdraw the U.S. from that agreement.\n\nHowever, Trumps past position on the Copenhagen conference runs counter to his current claims about the Paris deal.\n\nGrist, an environmental news site, reported that Trump and three of his adult children  Donald Jr., Eric and Ivanka  signed an open letter to President Obama urging the passage of legislation to combat climate change. The letter was published in the New York Times on Dec. 6, 2009, just before the climate conference in Copenhagen fromDec. 7 to Dec. 18, 2009.\n\nThe letter states, If we fail to act now, it is scientifically irrefutable that there will be catastrophic and irreversible consequences for humanity and our planet. The letter adds that investing in clean energy will spur economic growth, create new energy jobs, and increase our energy security all while reducing the harmful emissions that are putting our planet at risk.\n\nClinton, on the other hand, says she will deliver on the pledge President Obama made at the Paris climate conference.\n\nObama pledged to reduce the U.S.s emissions by 26 percent to 28 percent below 2005 levels by 2025. Likewise, Clinton says she will reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 30 percent in 2025 relative to 2005 levels and put the country on a path to cut emissions more than 80 percent by 2050.\n\nClinton claims she can achieve these goals by defending the Clean Power Plan, expanding clean energy production on public land, cutting the tax subsidies for oil and gas companies, and decreasing methane emissions by reducing leaks from new and existing natural gas sources, among other measures. Well discuss some of these policies in more detail in the following sections.\n\nPrior to the Clean Power Plan, no national legislation limited the amount of carbon dioxide power plants emitted into the atmosphere, which account for around 40 percent of the U.S.s total emissions.\n\nOn Aug. 3, 2015, the Environmental Protection Agency finalized the Clean Power Plan, which aims to reduce carbon emissions for existing power plants. When fully in place in 2030, carbon pollution from the power sector will be 32 percent below 2005 levels, says the EPA.\n\nAccording to theNew York Times, the Clean Power Plan gave Mr. Obama the leverage to negotiate the Paris Agreement.\n\nHowever, on Feb. 9, 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court placed a hold on the implementation of the plan based on requests of 27 states, including Republican vice presidential nominee Mike Pences home state of Indiana, as well as various companies.\n\nIn fact, on June 24, 2015, as governor of Indiana, Pence wrote a letter to Obama stating Indiana will not comply with the Clean Power Plan unless there is significant improvement in the final rule. Pence criticized the rule because he argued it would raise electricity costs and impede economic growth.\n\nThere is evidence to back up some of Pences claims.\n\nThe nonpartisan Energy Information Administrationfound that [r]etail electricity prices are higher when the CPP is in place than when it is not, as the fuel and capital costs of complying with the rule by shifting to natural gas-fired generation, or by building new renewable capacity, are passed through to retail prices.\n\nElectricity prices will increase between 2 percent to 7 percent depending on region by 2030 if the plan is implemented compared withif it is not. By 2040, price levelsrange from 0 percent to 4 percent higher with the plan.\n\nIf implemented, the EIA also found the plan will reduce carbonemissions from the U.S. electric power sector by 35 percent in 2030 compared with2005 levels.\n\nBut how do states meet the Clean Power Plans standards in the first place?\n\nIf implemented, the EPA would set emissions goals individually for each state, and the states would then choose the routes they want to take to meet those goals. Some states might choose to invest more in renewable energy, natural gas or nuclear power, while others might concentrate more on improving energy efficiency, for example. States would have to submit final complete state plans no later than Sept. 6, 2018. Along the way, states will also have to report their progress to the EPA.\n\nTargets differ across states because of each states unique mix of electricity-generation resourcesand also because of technological feasibilities, costs, and emissions reduction potentials, all of which vary across the country, explains the Union of Concerned Scientists.\n\nOverall, the plan offers states flexibility in how statescanboth meet and report progress toward their emissions goals.\n\nAccording to the World Bank, a carbon tax refers to a tax directly linked to greenhouse gas emissions that creates incentives for emitters to shift to less greenhousegas intensive ways of production and ultimately resulting in reduced emissions.\n\nOn Sept. 22, Trump told an audience in Pittsburgh, The platform produced by Hillary Clintons party this year also calls for a price on carbon.\'\n\nTrump is right. The Democratic Partys platform does include a carbon tax. It says, Democrats believe that carbon dioxide, methane, and other greenhouse gases should be priced to reflect their negative externalities, and to accelerate the transition to a clean energy economy and help meet our climate goals.\n\nBut Clintons own plan currently does not include a tax of greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nIn fact, emails recently released by WikiLeaks may provide insight into why this is the case, as Voxreported. Though yet to be verified by Clintons campaign, the emails include an exchange between Clintons campaign chairman, John Podesta, and one of her advisers, Jake Sullivan, from January 2015.\n\nExtensive polling conducted by the campaign showed that, after hearing the pros and cons of a carbon tax, 46 percent of people supported a carbon tax, Podesta told Sullivan in an email. In other emails, Robby Mook, Clintons campaign manager, allegedly said he was a bit nervous about rushing to say [Clinton would] never support such a tax, but that supporting one could also be lethal to her chance at the presidency.\n\nEmails more recently released on Oct. 20 also showed the Clinton campaign considered an aggressive carbon tax as a central pillar of her campaigns climate agenda, reported Environment & Energy Publishing.\n\nThe emails included a March 2015 memo sent by Pete Ogden, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, to Podesta, which, among other things, considered a GHG Pollution Fee of $42 per ton of GHG emissions.\n\nThe memo noted that household energy costs would rise by roughly $478 per year on average and gasoline prices may increase by around 40 cents per gallon between 2020 and 2030 with such a carbon tax. But it also said the revenues generated from the tax and converted into a rebate for taxpayers more than cover the increase in energy costs for all households.\n\nBut a carbon tax may face roadblocks in Congress.Even with Democrats in control of Congress, a House-approved carbon cap-and-trade bill died in the Senate in 2010, when some Democrats broke with President Obama and the partys congressional leaders.\n\nSome Senate Democrats also have voted to approve an amendment to protect the United States from an energy tax, i.e. a tax on carbon emissions.\n\nThe New York Times wrote that Podesta, the architect of both the Obama and Clinton climate change plans, crafted a plan for Clinton that seeks to reduce emissions without waiting for Congress to pass a carbon tax.\n\nAs for Trump, theres not much to say on the topic of a carbon tax. Trumps energy planpromises to spur economic growth and create jobs by repealing current measures to cut GHG emissions, not add new ones. It maintains that Obamas onslaught of regulations has been a massive self-inflicted economic wound.\n\nHydraulic fracturing, or fracking, is a methodthat recovers gas and oil from shale, a type of rock. The technique involves drilling into the earth and injecting water, sand and chemicals at high pressure, which releases oil and gas that would otherwise be difficult to reach.\n\nFracking has caused a boom in oil and natural gas production in the U.S. But, when it comes to climate change, critics argue the expansion of fracking for natural gas has only postponed the move toward clean energy sources like wind and solar. Proponents say natural gas can act as a bridge fuel between coal and renewables.\n\nNatural gas when burned emits about half the amount of carbon as coal. However,the production of natural gas also can lead toleaks of methane, the main component of natural gas. Methane is 28 to 36 times more potent as a greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide over a 100-year period.\n\nAccording to the Bureau of Land Management, There are more than 100,000 oil and gas wells on federally managed lands. Of wells currently being drilled, over 90 percent use hydraulic fracturing.\n\nTrump and Clinton actually agree on one aspect of fracking: They both think towns and states should be able to ban the techniquein their areas.\n\nTrump, however,has criticizedClinton for claimingduring the primary debate in Flint last March: By the time we get through all of my conditions, I do not think there will be many places in America where fracking will continue to take place.\n\nClinton has said she doesnt support fracking when (1) any locality or any state is against it, (2) release of methane or contamination of water is present and (3) fracking operations dont tell us exactly what chemicals they are using.\n\nBut Clinton herself has admitted that the president doesnt have much authority to ban fracking.\n\nAfter theprimary debate in Durham, New Hampshire, in February, a representative from350 Action, an environmental group, asked Clinton, With so much of the environmental community opposing fracking how do you expect to win over young peoples votes if you are still support fracking?\n\nThe states have a lot of authority with fracking, Clinton responded. I dont think the president does, but what the [federal] government does have the authority to do is to impose very strict regulations.\n\nThe questioner then asked her, Perhaps banning extraction on public lands? Clinton responded, Yeah, thats a done deal. Sheadded later, Thats where the president is moving. No future extraction, I agree with that.\n\nBut Clinton could have trouble even imposing regulations on fracking and even just on federal lands, givenroadblocks President Obama has experienced.\n\nIn March, the Department of the Interior passeda final rule that addressed fracking well construction and chemical use on federal land. But the rule was overturned by one of Obamas judicial appointees,Scott Skavdahlof the District Court of Wyoming, reported The Hill.Congress has not delegated to the Department of Interior the authority to regulate hydraulic fracturing on federal lands or otherwise, Skavdahl said.\n\nStill, the Clinton campaign states that Clintonwould control fugitive methane emissions byensuring new natural gas pipelines are built to the highest standards and repairing or replacing thousands of miles of leaky pipes by the end of her first term, if elected.\n\nTrump, on the other hand, told an audience in Pittsburgh in September thathe wouldexpand natural gas and coal production on federal lands, adding we will end the war on coal.\n\nBut as the New York Times points out, it might be difficult for Trump to boost natural gas production while also saving the coal industry.\n\nFracking technology has led to an upswing in natural gas production, which decreased demand for coal. Natural gas is currently around20 percent cheaper than coal. In 2015, natural gas surpassed coal as the U.S.s largest source of electricity.\n\nRobert N. Stavins, director of the environmental economics program at Harvard, also told the Times, If the Trump administration wanted to help coal, it could ban fracking. But he cant have it both ways.\n\nAccording to the EnergyInformation Administration, U.S. power plants used renewable energy sources, including water, wind, biomass wood and waste, geothermal, and solar, to generate about 13% of the electricity produced in the United States during 2015. Hydroelectric power made up the largest share, but wind and solar energy production have also increased substantiallyin the past few years.\n\nTrump has said his energy policy will make full use of our domestic energy sources, including traditional and renewable energy sources, so long as it allows the U.S. to accomplish a complete American energy independence.\n\nWhile Trump has outlined policies to bolster fossil fuel production, he hasnt specified any policies in favor of wind, solar or other renewable energies.\n\nHe has also criticized both solar and wind energy on numerous occasions.\n\nFor example, in November 2015 in Newton, Iowa  the state that produces the most wind energy, as a percentage of its total energy generation  Trump told an audience member hes fine with a wind energy tax credit.\n\nTrump added, wind is a problem because its a very expensive form of energy.But, as we found earlier this year, wind energy is cheaper than coal- or gas-powered energy in some parts of the country, particularly Iowa and Texas. On average nationwide, wind was more expensive than coal and gas in the second half of 2015, when Trump made his comment in Iowa, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance. But wind is now cheaper than coal, and more expensive than gas.\n\nBloomberg New Energy Finance provided us with prices for the second half of 2016: Gas is less expensive at $52 per megawatt hour compared with onshore wind at $56 per MWh in the U.S. on average. But coal is at $65 per MWh. Those numbers do not include government subsidies.\n\nThe EIAprojects thatthe average rate for new combined cycle natural gas-fired plants entering service in 2018 will be around $48 per MWh. The unsubsidized rate for onshore wind farms for 2018 will be $51.9 per MWh. With subsidies, the rate for onshore wind drops to $34 per MWh.\n\nTrump also has claimed wind farms in the U.S. kill more than 1 million birds a year, as we alsowrotein June.\n\nReliable data are scarce, but current mean estimates range from 20,000 to 573,000 bird deaths per year. Research also suggests oil productionkills the same, if not more, birds per year than wind farms.\n\nIn Fresno in May, Trump also told an audience, I know a lot about solar. I love solar, but there are a lot of problems with it. One problem is its too expensive.\n\nSolar power is pricier than wind, and the EIA doesnt project that the cost will go below natural gas in 2018. The EIA projectsthe cost for solar will be $71 per MWh without subsidies and $53.5 per MWh with subsidies in 2018. Bloombergfound that the cost of solar photovoltaic power in the U.S. on average was $72 or $79 per MWh in the second half of 2016, depending on whether the panels move to capture more sunlight.\n\nSolar power received27 percent of government subsidies and support in 2013, according to the EIA. Wind energy received the largest portion at 37 percent. However, coal, natural gas and nuclear energy also received federal subsidies and support at 6 percent, 4 percent and 10 percent, respectively.\n\nClintons plan for renewables has two major tenets: (1) install more than half a billion solar panels across the country by the end of her first term and (2) generate enough clean renewable energy to power every American home with 10 years of taking office.\n\nDaniel Cohan, a professor of environmental engineering at Rice University in Houston, wrote in The Hill that Clintons plan is ambitious, but not implausible.\n\nHe explained that Clintons plan is beyond what the EIAcurrently projects for 2020, but itspast predictionshave tended to underestimate solar growth.\n\nHe also noted that if a Clinton administration can achieve her 2020 solar goal, it would likely put the 2027 renewable energy goal within reach, her second tenet.\n\nUsing the EIAs numbers, Cohan points out that residential electricity consumption will reach 1,400 billion kWh by 2027, with renewable energy generating 1,040 billion kWh if the Clean Power Plan is implemented. If Clinton can manage to achieve her solar goal by 2020, that would close about half of that gap, leaving seven years for more solar plus other sources like wind to reach her 2027target, which would be feasible, he said.\n\nBut Cohan also writes achieving the solar target will depend on a series of initiatives that are only vaguely described in Clintons plan.\n\nThese initiatives include grant funding for cities and states through her $60 billion Clean Energy Challenge, a Solar X-Prize for communities that cut the red tape that slows rooftop solar installation times and the expansion of renewable energy on public land and federal buildings.\n\nCosts for renewable energy tend to drop as more capacity is installed, Cohan added. This reflects not only economies of scale but also advances in technologies to meet growing demand.\n\nAs evidence for thisstatement, Cohen cited a 2015 study published in the journal Energy Policy that found that solar costs drop roughly 23 percent each time capacity doubles. Success can breed success, he said.\n\nIn addition toobtaining more energy from renewable and clean sources, another way to address climate change is to increase the countrys energy efficiency. Buildingsaccount for39percent of the U.S. total energy consumption, more than eithertransportation orindustry,making them one potential target for improvingefficiency.\n\nClintons plan for advanced buildings includes various measures aimed at cutting energy waste in American homes, schools, stores, municipal buildings, hospitals and offices by a third within ten years of taking office. This goal will help keep the United States at the forefront of tackling the climate challenge, the campaign says.\n\nSome of these measures include phasing downfuel oil and propane to heat homes and businesses over the long term, working with companies like Zillow and Trulia to make expected energy cost information easily available to prospective [home] buyers and expanding the Environmental Protection Agencys Energy Star program for appliances to include a broader range of models and products.\n\nAs part of her $60 billion Clean Energy Challenge, Clinton says she will award grants to states, cities and rural communities to overcome barriers to improving energy efficiency in residential, public and commercial buildings. This could include adopting and enforcing betterbuilding energy codes, which have already reduced carbon emissions by roughly 3 percent in terms of the projected national CO2 emissions in 2030, says the U.S. Department of Energy.\n\nAs for Trumps claimsabout faulty temperature control and lighting, research has shown that occupants of LEED buildings have the same, if not greater, workplace satisfaction than occupants of conventional buildings when it comes to lighting and temperature.\n\nIn 2013, National Research Council Canada published apaperin the journalBuilding Research & Informationthat compared the indoor environments of conventional and LEED-certified buildings in Canada and the U.S. The study found that there was no difference between the measured temperatures and any physical measure of lighting in LEED and conventional buildings.\n\nEditors Note: SciCheck is made possible by a grant from the Stanton Foundation.\n\nClimate change enjoyed its 2 seconds of fame in the final debate.

He\'s called it an urgent problem, and he\'s called it a hoax. He\'s claimed it\'s a scam invented by the Chinese, and he\'s denied that he ever said that. He\'s promised to \"cancel\" the historic Paris climate agreement, and he\'s said he still has an \"open mind\" on the matter.\n\nSome environmental activists have pointed to Trump\'s unpredictable statements as evidence that he might not follow through on his campaign pledges to dismantle the Obama administration\'s climate legacy. But Trump has already put one of the nation\'s most prominent climate skeptics in charge of the Environmental Protection Agency transition. And just last week, one of Trump\'s top aides assured Americans that the president-elect still believes climate science is mostly \"bunk.\"\n\nFor those keeping score at home, here\'s a timeline of the Donald\'s thoughts on global warming. We\'ll update it from time to time.\n\nTrump signs a letter calling for urgent climate action. As Grist reported earlier this year, Trump and three of his children signed a 2009 letter to President Barack Obama calling for a global climate deal. \"We support your effort to ensure meaningful and effective measures to control climate change, an immediate challenge facing the United States and the world today,\" declared the letter, which was signed by dozens of business leaders and published as an ad in the New York Times. \"If we fail to act now, it is scientifically irrefutable that there will be catastrophic and irreversible consequences for humanity and our planet.\"\n\nTrump changes his mind, says Gore should be stripped of Nobel Prize because it\'s cold outside. According to the New York Post, Trump had changed his tune by early 2010, telling an audience at one of his golf clubs, \"With the coldest winter ever recorded, with snow setting record levels up and down the coast, the Nobel committee should take the Nobel Prize back from Al GoreGore wants us to clean up our factories and plants in order to protect us from global warming, when China and other countries couldn\'t care less. It would make us totally noncompetitive in the manufacturing world, and China, Japan and India are laughing at America\'s stupidity.\" (He would later say he was joking about the Nobel Prize being rescinded.)\n\nTrump claims scientists admitted global warming is a \"con.\" Around this time, Trump caught wind of the so-called \"ClimateGate scandal,\" in which climate deniers wrongly claimed a trove of hacked emails showed that scientists had conspired to fabricate evidence of global warming. Trump said (inaccurately) on Fox News that there was an email \"sent a couple months ago by one of the leaders of global warming, the initiativealmost sayingI guess they\'re saying it\'s a con.\" He added that \"in Washington, where I\'m building a big development, nobody can move because we have 48 inches of snow.\"\n\nTrump says scientists are in on the hoax. On January 6, Trump went on Fox News to discuss a severe cold snap that set records across the country. \"This winter is brutal,\" said Trump, adding that climate change is a \"hoax\" perpetrated by \"scientists [who] are having a lot of fun.\" Trump kept up this line of argument throughout the long and miserable winter. This very expensive GLOBAL WARMING bullshit has got to stop. Our planet is freezing, record low temps,and our GW scientists are stuck in ice  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 2, 2014 NBC News just called it the great freeze - coldest weather in years. Is our country still spending money on the GLOBAL WARMING HOAX?  Donald J.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 29, 2014\n\nTrump donates money to fight climate change. At some point in 2014, Trump donated $5,000 of his foundation\'s money to Protect Our Winters, an advocacy group dedicated to \"mobilizing the outdoor sports community to lead the charge towards positive climate action.\" As the group\'s website explains, \"If we\'re serious about slowing climate change, it\'s imperative that we decrease our dependence on fossil fuels and focus on cleaner sources of energy and electricity.\" According to the New York Daily News, Trump made the donation at the request of Olympic snowboarding gold medalist Jamie Anderson, who was one of the contestants on Trump\'s Celebrity Apprentice reality show. Anderson was participating on behalf of Protect Our Winters, which, she said on the show, \"brings light and inspiration to climate change.\" Still, Trump remained a climate change denier. During the season premier, which aired in early 2015, Trump suggested that New York\'s cold weather undermined Gilbert Gottfried\'s belief in climate science:\n\n\"I\'m not a believer in man-made global warming.\" During the GOP primary race, Trump kept up his climate denial. Here he is on Hugh Hewitt\'s radio show: \"I\'m not a believer in man-made global warming. It could be warming, and it\'s going to start to cool at some point. And you know, in the early, in the 1920s, people talked about global coolingThey thought the Earth was cooling. Now, it\'s global warmingBut the problem we have, and if you look at our energy costs, and all of the things that we\'re doing to solve a problem that I don\'t think in any major fashion exists.\"\n\nTrump says it\'s \"ridiculous\" for Obama to pursue the Paris climate agreement. The long-anticipated Paris climate negotiations began barely two weeks after the city was struck by a devastating series of terrorist attacks. As the talks kicked off, Obama called the summit \"an act of defiance\" against terrorism and urged the world leaders gathered there to agree to an ambitious deal to combat global warming. Trump took to Instagram to express his disapproval. \"While the world is in turmoil and falling apart in so many different waysespecially with ISISour president is worried about global warming,\" he said. \"What a ridiculous situation.\"\n\n\"A lot of it\'s a hoax,\" and \"I want to use hair spray.\" During a campaign speech in Hilton Head, South Carolina, Trump criticized Obama for worrying too much about \"the carbon footprint\" of the greenhouse gas emissions that are causing climate changean issue that Trump proceeded to conflate with the hole in the ozone layer. \"I want to use hair spray,\" complained Trump. \"They say, \'Don\'t use hair spray, it\'s bad for the ozone.\' So I\'m sitting in this concealed apartment, this concealed unitIt\'s sealed, it\'s beautiful. I don\'t think anything gets out. And I\'m not supposed to be using hair spray?\" He then returned to the subject of the climate hoax: \"So Obama\'s talking about all of this with the global warming and thea lot of it\'s a hoax, it\'s a hoax. I mean, it\'s a money-making industry, okay? It\'s a hoax, a lot of it.\"\n\nTrump says his claim that global warming is a Chinese hoax was a \"joke.\" At a Democratic debate in January, Bernie Sanders criticized Trump, noting the real estate mogul \"believes that climate change is a hoax invented by the Chinese.\" Trump responded the next day on Fox News, suggesting that his infamous 2012 tweet was a joke. \"I think the climate change is just a very, very expensive form of tax,\" said Trump, according to PolitiFact. \"A lot of people are making a lot of moneyAnd I often joke that this is done for the benefit of China. Obviously, I joke. But this is done for the benefit of China, because China does not do anything to help climate change. They burn everything you could burn; they couldn\'t care less. They have veryyou know, their standards are nothing. But theyin the meantime, they can undercut us on price. So it\'s very hard on our business.\"\n\nTrump wants to build a sea wall to protect his resort from global warming. Politico reported that one of Trump\'s golf clubs asked officials in County Clare, Ireland, to approve construction of a sea wall to guard against the dangers of sea level rise and \"more frequent storm events.\" According to an environmental impact statement submitted with the application, \"If the predictions of an increase in sea level rise as a result of global warming prove correctit is likely that there will be a corresponding increase in coastal erosion ratesIn our view, it could reasonably be expected that the rate of sea level rise might become twice of that presently occurring.\"\n\nTrump says he \"probably\" called climate change a \"hoax.\" In a remarkably odd exchange on Fox News, Bill O\'Reilly asked Trump whether it was \"true\" that he had \"called climate change a hoax.\" Trump replied that he \"might have\" done so following the release of the ClimateGate emails. \"Yeah, I probably did,\" he added. \"I see what\'s going on.\" Trump went on to say that fossil fuels \"could have a minor impact\" on the climate but \"nothing [compared] to what they\'re talking about.\"\n\nTrump picks leading climate skeptic to run the EPA transition. Hours before Trump\'s first debate with Hillary Clinton, word leaked that he had chosen Myron Ebell of the Competitive Enterprise Institute to lead his transition efforts at the Environmental Protection Agency. Ebell has a long history of opposing efforts to fight climate change; he\'s even accused climate scientists of \"manipulating and falsifying the data.\" As we reported, \"Ebell has calledObama\'s Clean Power Plan \'illegal\' and the Paris Climate Accord a \'usurpation of the Senate\'s authority.\' Any small increase in global temperatures, he has said, is \'nothing to worry about.\'\"\n\nTrump has \"open mind\" on Paris agreement but still thinks scientists are misleading us. In an interview with the New York Times two weeks after his victory, Trump made a number of confusing and contradictory statements about climate science and policy. Asked if he still planned to pull out of the Paris agreement, Trump said, \"I have an open mind to it. We\'re going to look very carefully.\" He conceded that there is \"some connectivity\" between humans and climate change,\" adding, \"It depends on how much. It also depends on how much it\'s going to cost our companies.\" He claimed that the \"hottest day ever\" was in 1898. He said climate is \"a very complex subject. I\'m not sure anybody is ever going to really know.\" He once again invoked ClimateGate, declaring, \"They say they have science on one side but then they also have those horrible emails that were sent between the scientists.\" And, apparently in contrast to his request to build a sea wall in Ireland, Trump even speculated that sea level rise would actually improve the Trump National Doral golf course in Florida. (He may be wrong about that.)\n\nTrump\'s \"default position\" is that climate change \"is a bunch of bunk.\" Following Trump\'s confusing New York Times interview, incoming White House chief of staff Reince Priebus sought to reassure supporters that the president-elect is, in fact, a climate change denier. \"As far as this issue on climate change, the only thing he was saying, after being asked a few questions about it, is, \'Look, I\'ll have an open mind about it,\'\" Priebus explained on Fox. \"But he has his default position, which is that most of it is a bunch of bunk. But he\'ll have an open mind and listen to people.\"','2017-03-25 03:51:14'),(679,89,'d4a4aa97a314a586648c8a68081561cea20f7dbe7dfa940ee0cf388b3ac636e1','95a643324ed84292a99ab1938fef1910','','','(CNN)  Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump clashed Monday in their first head-to-head debate of the general election season, with Trump in particular straying from the truth, CNN\'s Reality Check Team found.\n\nThe team of reporters, researchers and editors across CNN listened throughout the debate and selected key statements from both candidates, rating them true; mostly true; true, but misleading; false; or it\'s complicated.\n\nClinton claimed Trump \"thinks that climate change is a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese,\" a charge Trump immediately denied. Who\'s telling the truth?\n\nOn November 6, 2012, Trump tweeted, \"The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive.\"\n\nOver a year later, Trump tweeted in response to weather reports, \"Snowing in Texas and Louisiana, record setting freezing temperatures throughout the country and beyond. Global warming is an expensive hoax!\"\n\nAnd Trump\'s doubts have continued into the campaign season.\n\nLast September, when he was seeking the Republican nomination, Trump told CNN that while he supports clean air and water, \"I am not a believer in climate change.\"\n\nTrump went on to refute the connection between climate change and a rise in extreme weather phenomenon.\n\n\"Weather changes,\" Trump said. \"And you have storms, and you have rain, and you have beautiful days, but I do not believe that we should imperil the companies within our country. And by the way, China is doing nothing.\"\n\nIn March, Trump took a more nuanced approach, telling a Washington Post editorial board that he doesn\'t believe climate change is the result of man-made causes.\n\n\"I think there\'s a change in weather,\" he said. \"I am not a great believer in man-made climate change. I\'m not a great believer.\"\n\nAnd while Trump has repeated the hoax line on multiple occasions, he\'s walked back the assertion that it was created by the Chinese, saying he meant that as a joke ... sort of.\n\n\"I often joke that this is done for the benefit of China,\" Trump said on Fox News\' \"Fox & Friends.\" \"Obviously, I joke, but this is done for the benefit of China, because China does not do anything to help climate change.\"\n\nWhile Trump doubts the validity of climate change, his company has prepared for it. According to a Politico report, Trump International Golf Links applied for a permit to build a sea wall at his golf course in Ireland to protect it from \"global warming and its effects.\"\n\nOur verdict: True. While Trump has wavered on the cause of climate change, he has repeatedly denied its existence and called it a hoax.\n\nClinton claimed that her economic plan would create 10 million jobs, while Trump\'s plan would cost the nation 3.5 million jobs.\n\n\"People have looked at both of our plans, have concluded that mine would create 10 million jobs and yours would lose us 3.5 million jobs,\" Clinton said.\n\nClinton is quoting a report from Moody\'s Analytics\' Mark Zandi that came out over the summer. Zandi\'s report said the nation\'s economy would grow by 10 million jobs under Clinton\'s plan, but lose 3.4 million under Trump.\n\nThose statistics, however, are misleading. Zandi found the economy would add 7.2 million jobs even if Clinton didn\'t do anything. So her plan would boost job growth by about 3 million jobs.\n\nMeanwhile, it\'s also not fair to compare the assertions that 10 million jobs would be gained under Clinton vs. 3.4 million jobs lost under Trump because the time frames are different. Contacted by CNNMoney, Zandi said a more accurate comparison to the 10 million jobs created under Clinton would be 400,000 jobs lost under Trump, not 3.4 million.\n\nAnother analysis by Oxford Economics found that under Clinton, the nation would create an additional 200,000 jobs by the start of 2021 if she implements all her policies. Under Trump, however, the US would lose 4 million jobs, according to the report, released earlier this month.\n\nTherefore, we rate Clinton\'s claim as true, but misleading.\n\nTrump and Clinton scuffled over the Trans-Pacific Partnership, with Trump asserting Clinton would ratify the massive trade pact should be elected president.\n\n\"You want to approve Trans-Pacific Partnership,\" Trump claimed. \"You were totally in favor of it. When you heard what I was saying, how bad it is, and you said, I can\'t win that debate.\"\n\n\"You called it the gold standard of trade deals,\" Trump continued. Clinton responded by claiming she said she \"hoped it would be a good deal, but when it was negotiated, which I was not responsible for, I concluded it wasn\'t.\"\n\nClinton is on the record calling TPP a \"gold standard\" deal in 2012 when she was serving as secretary of state, and her phrasing back then did not match her claim now of \"hoping\" the deal would be worthy of support.\n\n\"This TPP sets the gold standard in trade agreements to open free, transparent, fair trade, the kind of environment that has the rule of law and a level playing field,\" Clinton said at an event in Australia in 2012. \"And when negotiated, this agreement will cover 40% of the world\'s total trade and build in strong protections for workers and the environment.\"\n\nHowever, Trump\'s claim that Clinton would approve the trade deal if elected president does not match her current campaign statements. Clinton announced in October 2015 she was against TPP, saying the deal didn\'t match what she\'d hoped for as secretary of state. She has vowed to reject it if she wins.\n\n\"I oppose it now, I\'ll oppose it after the election, and I\'ll oppose it as president,\" Clinton said in August.\n\nTrump\'s claim that Clinton called TPP the \"gold standard\" is true. But Trump\'s claim Clinton would approve TPP as president is false.\n\nHow Trump got his start\n\nClinton hit Trump for his claims that he is a self-made man.\n\n\"You know, Donald was very fortunate in his life and that\'s all to his benefit,\" Clinton said. \"He started his business with $14 million, borrowed from his father.\"\n\nTrump has repeatedly said that he built his companies and wealth from a $1 million loan he received from his father. While that loan may have gotten Trump\'s business up and rolling, it leaves out many of the other loans and perks he got from being the son of a wealthy real estate developer in New York City.\n\nAccording to the Wall Street Journal, a 1985 casino license disclosure proves that at the time of its filing, Trump had taken out $14 million in loans from his father, Fred Trump, in the late 1970s and 1980s.\n\nFred\'s backing further helped Donald as he reassured city officials that he would \"watch the construction and provide the financial credibility\" of his son\'s first big hotel deal, according to Wayne Barrett\'s 1992 book, \"Trump: The Deals and the Downfall.\"\n\nThe elder Trump also set up trust funds to support his children, acted as a guarantor on loans that Donald applied for, and helped open doors for his son throughout the city.\n\nWhile it is true that Trump began to build his business with a $1 million loan from his father, Clinton\'s claim that Trump borrowed $14 million is also true and paints a more complete picture of the support Donald received from his father.\n\nWhen Clinton said Trump had said he would negotiate down the national debt if elected, Trump denied it was true.\n\nBut in a May debate, Trump said he would try reducing the national debt by trying to get creditors to accept lower amounts than the US owed.\n\nIn an exchange at Monday\'s debate, Clinton said, \"You\'ve said you\'d negotiate down the national debt.\" Trump interrupted her to say, \"Wrong.\"\n\nIn May, he also told CNBC that he would borrow, and if the economy crashed, he would \"make a deal.\"\n\nA few weeks later, Trump walked away from his comments about debt, telling CNN\'s Chris Cuomo he was misquoted.\n\n\"First of all, you never have to default because you print the money,\" he said on CNN\'s \"New Day.\"\n\nVerdict: True -- Trump claimed he would negotiate down the debt.\n\nClinton on Trump \'rooting\' for the housing crisis\n\nDiscussing financial progress since the Great Recession, Clinton accused Trump of rooting for the housing crisis.\n\n\"He said, back in 2006, I hope it does collapse, because then I can go in and buy some and make some money,\" she claimed.\n\nThe Democratic nominee based her claim on an audiobook released by now legally troubled Trump University in 2006. The audiobook, titled, \"How to Build a Fortune,\" includes an interview between Trump and marketing consultant Jon Ward.\n\nWard asked Trump about \"gloomy predictions that the real estate market (was) heading for a spectacular crash.\" Trump responded, \"I sort of hope that happens because then people like me would go in and buy. If there is a bubble burst, as they call it, you know you can make a lot of money ... If you\'re in a good cash position, which I\'m in a good cash position today, then people like me would go in and buy like crazy.\"\n\nClinton ended her comments on Trump\'s past remarks by noting the accuracy of his 2006 prediction saying, \"Well, it did collapse.\" Trump responded, \"That\'s called business, by the way.\"\n\nAs CNN predicted in May, Trump\'s comments from before his run for office did come back to haunt him.\n\nAnd that\'s called politics, by the way.\n\nTrump claimed that New York City\'s stop-and-frisk policy was not ruled unconstitutional -- but it was.\n\n\"It went before a judge who was a very against-police judge. It was taken away from her and our mayor, our new mayor, refused to go forward with the case,\" Trump said. \"They would have won an appeal.\"\n\nA federal judge deemed the policy carried out under Michael Bloomberg\'s mayoralty to violate the law of the land in August 2013, and Bloomberg vowed to appeal. But a few months later, Bloomberg was out of office, and his liberal successor, Bill de Blasio, dropped the appeal as part of a settlement with New York police in January 2014.\n\nSo while Trump is correct that it is unknown how an appeal might have turned out had it not been dropped, that is not what unfolded. The lower court\'s ruling was the final one, and so we rate Trump\'s claim false.\n\nTrump claimed that a false conspiracy theory about President Barack Obama\'s birthplace began with Clinton\'s 2008 presidential campaign.\n\n\"If you look at CNN this past week, Patti Solis Doyle was on Wolf Blitzer saying that this happened, (Sidney) Blumenthal sent McClatchy, highly respected reporter at McClatchy, to Kenya to find out about it, they were pressing very hard,\" Trump said. \"She failed to get the birth certificate. When I got involved I didn\'t fail, I got him to give the birth certificate. So, I\'m satisfied with it.\"\n\nFacts do not support Trump\'s claims. Blumenthal, a longtime Clinton friend, denied to CNN last week that he peddled theories about Obama\'s birthplace to reporters.\n\n\"This is false. Period,\" he said. \"Donald Trump cannot distract from the fact that he is the one who embraced and promoted the birther lie and bears the responsibility for it.\"\n\nTrump\'s characterization of Doyle\'s comments last week on CNN is similarly misleading. She told Wolf Blitzer that \"The campaign, nor Hillary, did not start the birther movement. Period. End of the story.\" She recalled there was a volunteer coordinator in Iowa who forwarded an email propegating the conspiracy, but that Clinton herself decided \"immediately\" to fire that person.\n\nAs for Blumenthal\'s role in the campaign, some 2008 staffers have told CNN that he was not officially part of the Clinton campaign, and a CNN check of Federal Election Commission records shows no payment to Blumenthal from the campaign.\n\nVerdict: Trump\'s claim that Clinton\'s campaign began the birther conspiracy is false.','2017-03-25 03:51:14'),(680,89,'d4a4aa97a314a586648c8a68081561cea20f7dbe7dfa940ee0cf388b3ac636e1','ecdc3e5ca43344199336d52ea9ec97af','','','(CNN) Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump clashed Monday in their first head-to-head debate of the general election season, with Trump in particular straying from the truth, CNN\'s Reality Check Team found.\n\nThe team of reporters, researchers and editors across CNN listened throughout the debate and selected key statements from both candidates, rating them true; mostly true; true, but misleading; false; or it\'s complicated.\n\nClinton claimed Trump \"thinks that climate change is a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese,\" a charge Trump immediately denied. Who\'s telling the truth?\n\nOn November 6, 2012, Trump tweeted, \"The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive.\"\n\nOver a year later, Trump tweeted in response to weather reports, \"Snowing in Texas and Louisiana, record setting freezing temperatures throughout the country and beyond. Global warming is an expensive hoax!\"\n\nAnd Trump\'s doubts have continued into the campaign season.\n\nTrump went on to refute the connection between climate change and a rise in extreme weather phenomenon.\n\n\"Weather changes,\" Trump said. \"And you have storms, and you have rain, and you have beautiful days, but I do not believe that we should imperil the companies within our country. And by the way, China is doing nothing.\"\n\nIn March, Trump took a more nuanced approach, telling a Washington Post editorial board that he doesn\'t believe climate change is the result of man-made causes.\n\n\"I think there\'s a change in weather,\" he said. \"I am not a great believer in man-made climate change. I\'m not a great believer.\"\n\nAnd while Trump has repeated the hoax line on multiple occasions, he\'s walked back the assertion that it was created by the Chinese, saying he meant that as a joke ... sort of.\n\n\"I often joke that this is done for the benefit of China,\" Trump said on Fox News\' \"Fox & Friends.\" \"Obviously, I joke, but this is done for the benefit of China, because China does not do anything to help climate change.\"\n\nWhile Trump doubts the validity of climate change, his company has prepared for it. According to a Politico report, Trump International Golf Links applied for a permit to build a sea wall at his golf course in Ireland to protect it from \"global warming and its effects.\"\n\nOur verdict: True. While Trump has wavered on the cause of climate change, he has repeatedly denied its existence and called it a hoax.\n\nClinton claimed that her economic plan would create 10 million jobs, while Trump\'s plan would cost the nation 3.5 million jobs.\n\n\"People have looked at both of our plans, have concluded that mine would create 10 million jobs and yours would lose us 3.5 million jobs,\" Clinton said.\n\nClinton is quoting a report from Moody\'s Analytics\' Mark Zandi that came out over the summer. Zandi\'s report said the nation\'s economy would grow by 10 million jobs under Clinton\'s plan, but lose 3.4 million under Trump.\n\nThose statistics, however, are misleading. Zandi found the economy would add 7.2 million jobs even if Clinton didn\'t do anything. So her plan would boost job growth by about 3 million jobs.\n\nMeanwhile, it\'s also not fair to compare the assertions that 10 million jobs would be gained under Clinton vs. 3.4 million jobs lost under Trump because the time frames are different. Contacted by CNNMoney, Zandi said a more accurate comparison to the 10 million jobs created under Clinton would be 400,000 jobs lost under Trump, not 3.4 million.\n\nAnother analysis by Oxford Economics found that under Clinton, the nation would create an additional 200,000 jobs by the start of 2021 if she implements all her policies. Under Trump, however, the US would lose 4 million jobs, according to the report, released earlier this month.\n\nTherefore, we rate Clinton\'s claim as true, but misleading.\n\nTrump hammered home that America has lost a multitude of jobs to what he said were bad trade deals. He cited two manufacturing-heavy states, Ohio and Michigan, which he said saw thousands of jobs pack up and leave.\n\n\"Thousands of jobs leaving Michigan, leaving Ohio. They\'re all leaving. And we can\'t allow it to happen anymore,\" Trump said.\n\nProblem is that those two states have actually gained jobs in recent years.\n\nThere were 5.5 million non-farm workers in Ohio in August, according to the most recent Bureau of Labor Statistics data. That\'s the most the Buckeye State has had since mid-2001. Ohio hit a low point of 5 million jobs in late 2009, just after the Great Recession ended. Employment has climbed steadily since then.\n\nMichigan, meanwhile, had 4.3 million jobs in August, about the same as in mid-2006. Employment had fallen to 3.8 million in mid-2009, but has since climbed back.\n\nSo we rate Trump\'s assertion as false.\n\nUS jobs going to Mexico\n\n\"Our jobs are fleeing the country. They\'re going to Mexico,\" Trump said while criticizing the North American Free Trade Agreement.\n\nTrump is right. American manufacturing jobs have gone to Mexico. One of the most recent examples is Carrier, which announced earlier year that it would send 1,400 jobs from a plant in Indianapolis to Mexico.\n\nBut Trump was wrong about Ford, which he criticized for moving production of its small cars to Mexico. Trump alleged that Ford is moving jobs to Mexico, but Ford emphasized that no jobs were lost at its Michigan plant in Mexico.\n\nHow many jobs lost to Mexico is highly debatable. Robert Scott, senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute, estimates that America lost roughly 800,000 jobs to Mexico between 1997 and 2013. Scott cites NAFTA as the key driver of job losses.\n\nHowever, some economists have criticized Scott\'s calculation because it\'s based on the size of the US trade deficit in Mexico -- it\'s not a head count of jobs. And some American manufacturers that export their products to Mexico depend on NAFTA to keep their business alive. The trade deal has hurt some Americans while benefiting others.\n\nStill, the US economy has shifted away from the manufacturing sector and the Mexican manufacturing sector has increased markedly. But it is hard to connect Mexico\'s gain to the US loss.\n\nSince 2000, America has lost 5 million manufacturing jobs for a variety of reasons, particularly cheaper labor overseas and technology.\n\nClinton on income and manufacturing jobs under Bill Clinton\n\nClinton pointed out that America did pretty well during her husband Bill Clinton\'s tenure in the White House.\n\n\"I think my husband did a pretty good job in the 1990s,\" Clinton said. \"Incomes went up for everybody. Manufacturing jobs went up also in the 1990s.\"\n\nIt\'s true that manufacturing employment expanded under Bill Clinton, rising to 17.1 million jobs in January 2001. That\'s up 313,000 positions from January 1993.\n\nIncomes also rose during Bill Clinton\'s two terms. Median household income was $50,478 when Clinton took office in 1993. It rose to $56,531 when he left in 2001.\n\nTrump and Clinton scuffled over the Trans-Pacific Partnership, with Trump asserting Clinton would ratify the massive trade pact should be elected president.\n\n\"You want to approve Trans-Pacific Partnership,\" Trump claimed. \"You were totally in favor of it. When you heard what I was saying, how bad it is, and you said, I can\'t win that debate.\"\n\n\"You called it the gold standard of trade deals,\" Trump continued. Clinton responded by claiming she said she \"hoped it would be a good deal, but when it was negotiated, which I was not responsible for, I concluded it wasn\'t.\"\n\nClinton is on the record calling TPP a \"gold standard\" deal in 2012 when she was serving as secretary of state, and her phrasing back then did not match her claim now of \"hoping\" the deal would be worthy of support.\n\n\"This TPP sets the gold standard in trade agreements to open free, transparent, fair trade, the kind of environment that has the rule of law and a level playing field,\" Clinton said at an event in Australia in 2012. \"And when negotiated, this agreement will cover 40% of the world\'s total trade and build in strong protections for workers and the environment.\"\n\nHowever, Trump\'s claim that Clinton would approve the trade deal if elected president does not match her current campaign statements. Clinton announced in October 2015 she was against TPP, saying the deal didn\'t match what she\'d hoped for as secretary of state. She has vowed to reject it if she wins.\n\n\"I oppose it now, I\'ll oppose it after the election, and I\'ll oppose it as president,\" Clinton said in August.\n\nTrump\'s claim that Clinton called TPP the \"gold standard\" is true. But Trump\'s claim Clinton would approve TPP as president is false.\n\nHow Trump got his start\n\nClinton hit Trump for his claims that he is a self-made man.\n\n\"You know, Donald was very fortunate in his life and that\'s all to his benefit,\" Clinton said. \"He started his business with $14 million, borrowed from his father.\"\n\nFred\'s backing further helped Donald as he reassured city officials that he would \"watch the construction and provide the financial credibility\" of his son\'s first big hotel deal, according to Wayne Barrett\'s 1992 book, \"Trump: The Deals and the Downfall.\"\n\nThe elder Trump also set up trust funds to support his children, acted as a guarantor on loans that Donald applied for, and helped open doors for his son throughout the city.\n\nWhile it is true that Trump began to build his business with a $1 million loan from his father, Clinton\'s claim that Trump borrowed $14 million is also true and paints a more complete picture of the support Donald received from his father.\n\nWhen Clinton said Trump had said he would negotiate down the national debt if elected, Trump denied it was true.\n\nBut in a May debate, Trump said he would try reducing the national debt by trying to get creditors to accept lower amounts than the US owed.\n\nIn an exchange at Monday\'s debate, Clinton said, \"You\'ve said you\'d negotiate down the national debt.\" Trump interrupted her to say, \"Wrong.\"\n\nIn May, he also told CNBC that he would borrow, and if the economy crashed, he would \"make a deal.\"\n\nA few weeks later, Trump walked away from his comments about debt, telling CNN\'s Chris Cuomo he was misquoted.\n\n\"First of all, you never have to default because you print the money,\" he said on CNN\'s \"New Day.\"\n\nVerdict: True -- Trump claimed he would negotiate down the debt.\n\nClinton on Trump \'rooting\' for the housing crisis\n\nDiscussing financial progress since the Great Recession, Clinton accused Trump of rooting for the housing crisis.\n\n\"He said, back in 2006, I hope it does collapse, because then I can go in and buy some and make some money,\" she claimed.\n\nThe Democratic nominee based her claim on an audiobook released by now legally troubled Trump University in 2006.

But a few months later, Bloomberg was out of office, and his liberal successor, Bill de Blasio, dropped the appeal as part of a settlement with New York police in January 2014.\n\nSo while Trump is correct that it is unknown how an appeal might have turned out had it not been dropped, that is not what unfolded. The lower court\'s ruling was the final one, and so we rate Trump\'s claim false.\n\nTrump on crime in New York\n\nTrump gave a hat tip to his hometown during the debate -- by claiming that the crime rate in New York is going up.\n\nHe interjected while Clinton was arguing against stop-and-frisk policing. She declared that the Big Apple is safer under Mayor Bill de Blasio.\n\n\"Under the current mayor, crime has continued to drop, including murders,\" Clinton said.\n\nAccording to the New York City Police Department\'s weekly CompStat report, murders are down for the year to date in 2016 compared with 2015, falling 4.3% from 257 to 246. An NYPD spokesman tweeted as the candidates clashed, \"NYC is on pace to have one of the safest years on record for crime.\"\n\nOver the past quarter century, the general trend for New York has been a decline in violent crime, according to the NYPD. The murder rate in 2016 is down more than 80% compared with 1990.\n\nOf course, New York crime stats can be as complex as the city itself. Murder rates fell to a record low during de Blasio\'s first year in office, so compared to 2014, murders are up in 2016.\n\nThe FBI\'s annual Uniform Crime Report, published hours before the debate, also showed a nationwide increase in murders for 2015. Perhaps Trump pored over the FBI report during debate prep or maybe he really does feel unsafe in the caverns of the Upper East Side. At the very least, as a salesman whose businesses rely on revenue from tourists, Trump should be a bit more measured discussing crime in New York, portray the nuance in the numbers and show some pride in his birthplace.\n\nWe rate this claim to be true, but misleading, because Trump seemingly only cited one data set and failed to acknowledge the NYPD\'s statistics, which indicate a downward trend.\n\nTrump claimed that a false conspiracy theory about President Barack Obama\'s birthplace began with Clinton\'s 2008 presidential campaign.\n\n\"If you look at CNN this past week, Patti Solis Doyle was on Wolf Blitzer saying that this happened, (Sidney) Blumenthal sent McClatchy, highly respected reporter at McClatchy, to Kenya to find out about it, they were pressing very hard,\" Trump said. \"She failed to get the birth certificate. When I got involved I didn\'t fail, I got him to give the birth certificate. So, I\'m satisfied with it.\"\n\nFacts do not support Trump\'s claims. Blumenthal, a longtime Clinton friend, denied to CNN last week that he peddled theories about Obama\'s birthplace to reporters.\n\n\"This is false. Period,\" he said. \"Donald Trump cannot distract from the fact that he is the one who embraced and promoted the birther lie and bears the responsibility for it.\"\n\nTrump\'s characterization of Doyle\'s comments last week on CNN is similarly misleading. She told Wolf Blitzer that \"The campaign, nor Hillary, did not start the birther movement. Period. End of the story.\" She recalled there was a volunteer coordinator in Iowa who forwarded an email propegating the conspiracy, but that Clinton herself decided \"immediately\" to fire that person.\n\nVerdict: Trump\'s claim that Clinton\'s campaign began the birther conspiracy is false.\n\nIn a discussion about cyberthreats, Clinton said of Russian President Vladimir Putin, \"One of the things he\'s done is let loose cyberattackers to hack into government files, to hack into personal files, hack into the Democratic National Committee.\"\n\n\"I don\'t know if anyone knows it was Russia that broke into the DNC,\" he said \"I don\'t know if it was.\"\n\n\"It could have been Russia,\" he added. \"It could be China. It could be someone sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds.\"\n\nThe cybersecurity firms Fidelis, Mandiant and ThreatConnect arrived at similar findings.\n\nSen. Dianne Feinstein, a California Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, and Rep. Adam Schiff, a California Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, recently released a statement saying that \"based on briefings we have received, we have concluded that the Russian intelligence agencies are making a serious and concerted effort to influence the US election.\"\n\nIn an interview with Bloomberg News, Putin denied Russian state involvement, saying, \"I don\'t know anything about it, and on a state level, Russia has never done this.\"\n\nWikiLeaks, the website responsible for publishing the leaked emails, has refused to say who provided them.\n\nVerdict: Absent Russian admission, it\'s hard to say with 100% certainty the Russian government ordered the DNC hack, but there\'s strong and compelling evidence they were linked to the hack. We therefore rate Clinton\'s claim as mostly true.\n\nTrump looked to contrast his tax plans with Clinton, saying that she would raise taxes on Americans.\n\n\"You are going to approve one of the biggest tax increases in history,\" Trump said, claiming he would slash taxes.\n\nAs she said during the debate, Clinton wants to raise taxes on the wealthy to pay for a variety of programs, such as instituting paid family leave, making college debt-free and investing in infrastructure. To raise the funds, she would require millionaires to pay at least 30% of their income in taxes and impose an additional 4% surcharge on those with adjusted gross incomes greater than $5 million. She would limit the value of certain deductions and exclusions to 28%, as well as raise capital gains taxes on high-income investors.\n\nAll told, the top 1% of households -- defined as bringing in more than $730,000 a year -- would see their tax burden go up by more than $78,000 on average, according to an analysis of Clinton\'s original tax plan from the Tax Policy Center.\n\nBut this would not be not the largest tax increase. In fact, previous presidents have pushed through much bigger hikes. The tax changes instituted during World War II and the Korean War were much larger, said Roberton Williams, a senior fellow at the non-partisan Tax Policy Center. The 1968 tax act was also larger.\n\nWilliams pointed to a US Treasury Department report that examined previous tax bills in terms of revenue raised and percentage of the gross domestic product.\n\nTherefore, we rate Trump\'s claim as false.\n\n\'My tax cut is the biggest since Ronald Reagan,\' Trump says\n\nTrump\'s proposed tax cuts are the largest since Ronald Reagan\'s signature tax cut in 1981 when measured as a share of the economy, tax and budget experts say.\n\nTrump\'s plan would reduce revenue by nearly $6 trillion, according to analyses by the Tax Foundation and the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. That\'s about 2.5% of GDP over a decade.\n\nThat\'s the biggest since Reagan\'s 1981 tax cuts, which reduced revenue by 2.9% of GDP over an even shorter period, according to US Treasury numbers.\n\nInteresting to note, however, that Reagan in 1982, 1983 and 1984 signed into law bills that raised revenue to address the burgeoning deficits that arose during his first term.\n\nWhile it is difficult to make exact comparisons, the CRFB estimates that it is likely that Trump\'s proposed tax cut is like the largest since Reagan.\n\nTrump on tax returns and paying no taxes\n\nPressed on why he was not releasing his tax returns, Trump said again that he was holding back because he is under federal audit.\n\n\"I don\'t mind releasing. I\'m under a routine audit, and it will be released. As soon as the audit\'s finished, it will be released,\" Trump said.\n\nTrump has offered multiples arguments throughout the campaign -- and even shifted once Monday night to say he was waiting on Clinton to release emails she deleted -- but he has routinely argued that a federal audit bars him from releasing his returns.\n\nBut the IRS does not bar the subject of an audit from releasing their returns -- it is up to the individual to decide whether they will release the returns.\n\nTrump could release his tax returns tonight -- whether he\'s under audit or not. Our verdict on that: false.\n\nSoon after, Clinton lit into Trump on his tax returns and quickly landed on an argument that he has not paid federal taxes.\n\n\"All of you watching tonight, to know that he\'s paid nothing in federal taxes, because the only years that anybody\'s ever seen were a couple of years when he had to turn them over to state authorities when he was trying to get a casino license and they showed he didn\'t pay any federal income tax,\" Clinton said.\n\nTrump jumped in and said, \"That mean\'s I\'m smart.\"\n\nBut Clinton continued, saying it means that Trump paid \"zero for troops, zero for vets, zero for schools or health.\"\n\nBut it\'s impossible to say whether he hasn\'t paid any federal income taxes since then without seeing more of his tax returns.\n\nBased on the available evidence, Clinton is correct about how little he has paid in taxes.\n\nClinton told Trump that her tax plan \"would not add a penny to the debt, and your plans would add $5 trillion to the debt.\"\n\nCRFB estimated that Trump\'s fiscal proposals as they are today would add $5.3 trillion to the nation\'s debt in the first decade. That would push debt held by the public to 105% of gross domestic product by 2026, up from 86% projected under current policies.\n\nBy contrast, Clinton\'s fiscal package would add an estimated $200 billion to the debt. While $200 billion is very much more than a penny, in terms of the federal budget over a decade it wouldn\'t move the needle on current projections of debt as a percent of GDP. It would still reach 86% of GDP by 2026.\n\nTrump touted his endorsements, saying, \"I was just endorsed by ICE. They never endorsed anybody before on immigration. I was just endorsed by ICE. I was just recently endorsed, (by) 16,500 Border Patrol agents.\"\n\nThe US Immigration and Customs Enforcement is, of course, an official government agency so it is not in the business of officially endorsing any candidate.\n\nThe union that represents ICE employees, the National Immigration and Customs Enforcement Officers Council has, however, given Trump their first endorsement ever for a candidate for elected office.\n\nWe\'re going to cut Trump some slack since the name of the union is similar to the agency. While Trump\'s claim of an ICE endorsement is misleading, it is true that the ICE union endorsed him.\n\nWe rate Trump\'s claim that he has been endorsed by 16,500 Border Patrol agents as true.\n\n\"We have a Fed that\'s doing political things ... the Fed is being more political than Secretary Clinton,\" Trump said.\n\nTrump\'s central argument is that the Federal Reserve, America\'s central bank, is keeping interest rates low to help the economy look good under Obama.\n\nFed Chair Janet Yellen emphatically denied any political influence at the Fed last Wednesday during a press conference after the Fed\'s decision-making committee ended its two-day meeting.\n\n\"We do not discuss politics at our meetings,\" Yellen said. \"Partisan politics plays no role in our decisions.\"\n\nThere is no evidence that the Fed has kept rates low in order to help Obama.\n\nThe Federal Reserve was created by Congress to be independent of political influence. Neither Congress nor the President can tell the Fed to raise, lower or hold interest rates. Only the 12 people on the Fed\'s committee make that decision.\n\n\"You\'ve taken business bankruptcy six times,\" Clinton said of her opponent. \"There are a lot of great businesspeople that have never taken bankruptcy once.\"\n\nClinton said Trump supported the US military interventions in Iraq and Libya against Saddam Hussein and Moammar Gadhafi.\n\n\"Donald supported the invasion of Iraq. That is proved over and over again. He actually advocated for the actions we took in Libya and urged that Gadhafi be taken out,\" Clinton said.\n\nLater, moderator Lester Holt said Trump did support the intervention in Iraq, and Trump claimed that the idea he backed the US-led invasion was something made up by the mainstream media.\n\nTrump did acknowledge that the idea he supported the war stemmed from an interview with Howard Stern.\n\nHe said he told Stern, \"Maybe, who knows.\"\n\nBut Trump actually said, \"Yeah, I guess so. I wish the first time it was done correctly,\" when asked in 2002 if he backed the invasion.\n\nHe also said during the debate that he told Fox News\' Neil Cavuto that he opposed the Iraq war.\n\nBut Trump -- on March 21, 2003, after the invasion began -- told Cavuto that \"it looks like a tremendous success from a military standpoint.\"\n\nTrump said he also told Fox News\' Sean Hannity that he opposed the war but this conversation was never on the record.\n\nTrump did tell Stern he backed the war and he told Cavuto after it began that it looked like a \"tremendous success.\"\n\nClinton also said Trump backed the 2011 intervention in Libya.\n\nIn a 2011 video posted on his own blog before the intervention in Libya, Trump said, \"Gadhafi in Libya is killing thousands of people, nobody knows how bad it is, and we\'re sitting around. We have soldiers all over the Middle East, and we\'re not bringing them in to stop this horrible carnage and that\'s what it is: It\'s a carnage.\"\n\nHe added, \"On a humanitarian basis, immediately go into Libya, knock this guy out very quickly, very surgically, very effectively, and save the lives.\"\n\nIn March 2011, after the NATO-led intervention began, Trump expressed concern about the allegiance of the anti-Gadhafi rebels, telling CNN, \"I hear they are aligned with Iran. I hear they may be aligned with al Qaeda.\"\n\nBut Trump still added, \"At this point, if you don\'t get rid of Gadhafi, it\'s a major, major black eye for this country.\"\n\nTrump did back an effort to take out Libya\'s leader Gadhafi on his own website.\n\nDuring an exchange about policing in America, Clinton claimed that \"the gun epidemic is the leading cause of death of young African-American men. More than the next nine causes put together.\"\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC maintains extensive data on causes and manners of death, but does not sort its data into a single \"gun epidemic\" category. However, piecing together several different CDC data sets, Clinton\'s claim is largely true.\n\nHowever, using a different set of CDC data focusing on deaths caused by firearms, we can see that the vast majority of homicides were indeed firearm-related.\n\nIn 2013, there were a total of 5,214 homicides among black American men age 15 to 34. Among that same population, there were 5,278 deaths by firearm. And according to the CDC, a total of 4,701 black men in that age group were killed by firearm in incidents that were ruled homicides.\n\nIn short, homicides were the leading cause of death for black men age 15-34, and 90% of those deaths were caused with a firearm.\n\nClinton parried a claim from Trump about her \"stamina\" by pointing to Trump\'s history of uncouth remarks about women. Spointed to one woman in particular: Alicia Machado, or as Clinton said Trump called her, \"Miss Piggy\" and \"Miss Housekeeping.\"\n\n\"Where did you find this?\" Trump asked repeatedly.\n\n\"She has become a US citizen,\" Clinton said. \"And you can bet she\'s going to vote this November.\"\n\nClinton found it on Inside Edition, where the Miss Universe of 1996 said Trump tried to humiliate her after she gained weight.\n\n\"He called me, like, Miss Piggy, Miss Housekeeping,\" said Machado, who was one of many women featured in a critical The New York Times article.\n\nMachado has no evidence that Trump made those insults, and Trump indicated he had no familiarity with it -- though he did not outright deny it.\n\nBut all the testimony that exists indicates that Clinton\'s comments are true.\n\nTrump was asked about the NATO alliance. He repeated his criticism that the other members of the 28-nation defense alliance do not pay their fair share.\n\n\"We pay approximately 73% of the cost of NATO, that\'s a lot of money to protect other people,\" he said.\n\nThe US actually only pays about 22% of NATO\'s operational budget; member states\' contributions to NATO\'s organizational budget is proportionate to their respective gross national income. But the NATO budget only funds the civil budget, military budget and the Security Investment Program. This is a relatively small portion of national defense spending by all the countries, with the entire budget being slightly more than $2 billion. The US contribution to NATO\'s direct funding is less than 1% of the US defense budget.\n\nTrump is likely referring to the US share of defense spending among NATO countries -- that number is indeed 73%. The imbalance is due in part to the fact that only five NATO members meet the NATO recommendation that each country spend 2% of its GDP on defense, and the US GDP is significantly larger than all the other NATO members.\n\nThough US Assistant Secretary of State for European Affairs Hoyt Brian Yee told the Senate this month that \"all 28 allies are moving toward spending at least 2% of GDP on defense, with 70% already on track to meet that goal by 2024.\"\n\nTherefore, while Trump\'s 73% number is true for now, more and more NATO members meeting the 2% requirement will drive this number down.\n\nBut while analysts, including NATO ones, agree that the 73% number is indicative of the lack of appropriate defense spending among the other members of the alliance, that percentage reflects US defense spending overall and not just spending on US forces allocated to the defense of Europe and other NATO operations.\n\nNATO\'s official statement on indirect funding says, \"This does not mean that the United States covers 73% of the costs involved in the operational running of NATO as an organization, including its headquarters in Brussels and its subordinate military commands, but it does mean that there is an over-reliance by the Alliance as a whole on the United States for the provision of essential capabilities, including for instance, in regard to intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance; air-to-air refueling; ballistic missile defense; and airborne electronic warfare.\"\n\nBecause Trump says the phrase \"73% of the cost of NATO\" in his comments, and because that number does not reflect actual US direct spending on the alliance, and because the number captures US defense spending not-related to NATO, this is an inaccurate description of the cost of NATO.\n\nTrump claimed credit for the creation of a new position at NATO.\n\n\"About four months ago, I read on the front page of the Wall Street Journal that NATO is opening up a major terror division. I think that\'s great.\"\n\nHe later added, \"I\'m sure I\'m not going to get credit for it, but that was largely because of what I was saying, my criticism of NATO.\"\n\nTrump is referring to reports that NATO would create a new post, an assistant secretary general for intelligence. He also claimed credit for the post\'s creation at the time via a tweet.\n\nBecause the post is a broader intelligence position, the creation of which has been sought by NATO before Trump began his public criticism of the alliance, his claim of responsibility is inaccurate.\n\nWhen Holt turned to Trump on the subject of a possible preemptive nuclear strike, Trump responded by turning the conversation to familiar territory: criticism of the current administration for failing to invest in military equipment.\n\n\"We have not been updating from the new standpoint,\" Trump said.\n\nThis is not true. The United States is in the process of updating all three aspects of the nuclear triad.\n\n\"I looked the other night, I saw B-52s, they\'re old enough that your father, your grandfather could be flying them. We are not keeping up with other countries.\"\n\nWe rate Trump\'s claim that we are not updating our own nuclear technology as false and his claim that our planes are old enough to be flown by your grandfather true, but misleading, and also, incidentally, a tribute to an impressive piece of equipment.','2017-03-25 03:51:14'),(681,89,'d4a4aa97a314a586648c8a68081561cea20f7dbe7dfa940ee0cf388b3ac636e1','8f2d07f499dd4d7eae9fdbd5a50e9e3b','','','The Department of Energy refusal is as unprecedented as the Trump transition team\'s initial request for the names.\n\nUber to cease controversial use of Greyball: Will that be enough to repair its image?\n\nThe Department of Energy (DOE) has refused to give the individual names of workers associated with work on climate change in response to a request from President-elect Donald Trump.\n\nWhile a request for information for an incoming president is not unusual, questions from the Trump team asking for lists of who was involved with climate change research and negotiations under the Obama administration raised fears of a \"witch hunt\" among many DOE employees. Mr. Trump has called human-caused climate change a \"hoax\" on multiple occasions, putting him at odds with the majority of the scientific community.\n\nWhile most politicians prefer agencies under their control to be staffed by employees and researchers sympathetic to their ideas and causes, the specific nature of the request and potential high cost of climate change denial have made this situation unprecedented. Few, if any, credible climate scientists still doubt that human activity contributes in some way to global warming, and most world powers agree that immediate action is necessary on a global scale in order to prevent warming to dangerous levels. In addition to the environmental concerns, many critics of Trump are also worried that his transition team\'s request indicates that climate change workers who are just doing their jobs could be unjustly marginalized by the incoming administration.\n\nLast week, the Trump teamsent a questionnaireto the DOE asking for details about various aspects in the agency\'s policies, not in itself an unusual occurrence. But as as The Christian Science Monitorpreviously reported:\n\nThe questionnairespecifically asked for the names of all DOE employees who attended the United Nations annual climate talks for the past five years, employees who helped develop the President Obamas social cost of carbon metrics, and which programs are essential to President Obamas Climate Action Plan. All of which raises concerns that Trumps administration will target employees involved in Obama-era policies that the president-elect spent his campaign promising to dismantle, including the Paris Climate Agreement, Clean Power Plan, and various other DOE and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulations.\n\n\"The identity of employees that worked on climate change projects may be a reasonable administrative request; however, their affiliations would seem to be beyond the pale, and an implicit statement that the employees are motivated by small \'p\' politics rather than science.\" Daniel Riesel, principal of the environmental law firm Sive, Paget & Riesel,tells the Monitor in an email. \"The new administration should be able to evaluate the climate change work without meddling in the employees personal predilections  unless of course that is the basis of the new Administrations approach to climate change science.\"\n\nSome people in the department who Trump\'s team asked to be named may have feared that their jobs might be at stake. While there are protections in place that make outright firing unlikely, there are other ways employees could be punished by the administration, says Todd Eberly, professor of political science atSt. Marys College of Maryland.\n\n\"There are significant Civil Service protections in place, but a person could easily be marginalized or ostracized,\" Dr. Eberly tells the Monitor in an email. \"Likewise, the executive branch could use budgeting priorities to eliminate positions or redirect funds in a away that marginalizes targeted employees.\"\n\nIn an act of defiance to protect these employees, no less unprecedented than the initial questionnaire itself, the Department of Energy has refused to give Trump the names of specific employees requested by the team.\n\n\"Our career workforce, including our contractors and employees at our labs, comprise the backbone of DOE (Department of Energy) and the important work our department does to benefit the American people,\" Eben Burnham-Snyder, a DOE spokesman,told the Washington Post in an email. \"We are going to respect the professional and scientific integrity and independence of our employees at our labs and across our department.We will be forthcoming with all publicly-available information with the transition team.We will not be providing any individual names to the transition team.\" [Emphasis in original.]\n\nBut despite the evident strong feelings of the current administrators of the department, Eberly says the DOE would likely not be able to refuse or ignore a similar request under the Trump administration.\n\nThe DOE\'s mission statement, according to itswebsite, \"is to ensure America\'s security andprosperity by addressing its energy, environmental and nuclear challenges throughtransformative science and technology solutions.\" Much of the environmental concerns of the department is related, at least in part, to cleaner sources of energy focused on reducing greenhouse gas emissions and curbing global climate change.\n\nBut both Trump and his nominee to head the DOE, former Texas governor Rick Perry, are climate change skeptics. Trump has called climate change a \"hoax\" on multiple occasions, though he has been known to waver on that hardline position somewhat. In November, the president-elect told the New York Times thathe would keep an \"open mind\" about human-caused climate change and the possibility of not pulling out of the Paris Agreement, the international climate change accords that aim to prevent global temperatures rising above 2 degrees C over pre-industrial levels. On Dec. 5, Trump met with former vice president Al Gore, who won a Nobel Peace Prize for his work raising awareness about climate change.However, his cabinet picks so far don\'t indicate any softening of his stance, especially with his choice of Environmental Protection Agency chief, Scott Pruitt, who has sued the EPA for its greenhouse gas emission reduction policies.\n\n\"It\'s likely that Perry\'s agenda [for the Department of Energy] will reflect Trump\'s - more domestic production of readily available sources of energy,\" says Eberly. \"The focus will be on independence, production, and affordability. It\'s likely that environmental concerns will become secondary or tertiary concerns.\"','2017-03-25 03:51:14'),(682,89,'d4a4aa97a314a586648c8a68081561cea20f7dbe7dfa940ee0cf388b3ac636e1','c33afbf3fdfb416bbfa377e4b283bd8a','','','Says \"Donald Trump says climate change is a hoax invented by the Chinese.\"\n\nDuring her take-no-prisoners foreign policy speech on June 2, Hillary Clinton reminded listeners of controversial things that Republican presidential rival Donald Trump has said over the years.\n\nAt one point, Clinton said, \"Donald Trump says climate change is a hoax invented by the Chinese.\"\n\nDid he? Yes, though he later said it was a joke.\n\nThe original source of this claim was a tweet Trump sent on Nov. 6, 2012, as we noted in a January 2016 fact-check of a similar claim by Clintons Democratic opponent, Bernie Sanders.\n\nTrumps tweet said, \"The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive.\"\n\nSo Clinton certainly has evidence to support her claim. But we should also note that Trump backed off his claim after Sanders noted them in January on NBCs Meet the Press, calling the Chinese link a \"joke.\"\n\nOn Jan. 18, after Sanders had attacked Trumps climate change views in the Democratic debate, Trump told Fox & Friends, \"Well, I think the climate change is just a very, very expensive form of tax. A lot of people are making a lot of money. I know much about climate change. I\'d be  received environmental awards. And I often joke that this is done for the benefit of China. Obviously, I joke. But this is done for the benefit of China, because China does not do anything to help climate change. They burn everything you could burn; they couldn\'t care less. They have very  you know, their standards are nothing. But they  in the meantime, they can undercut us on price. So it\'s very hard on our business.\"\n\nTrump may call the mention of Chinas role a joke, but he certainly has a lengthy record of using the word \"hoax\" to describe climate change. (For the record, in 2014 we rated the claim that climate change is a \"hoax\" Pants on Fire.)\n\nOn Dec. 30, 2015, Trump told the crowd at a rally in Hilton Head, S.C., \"Obama\'s talking about all of this with the global warming and  a lot of it\'s a hoax. It\'s a hoax. I mean, it\'s a money-making industry, okay? It\'s a hoax, a lot of it.\"\n\nThats three times using \"hoax\" in one sentence. Trump has also used the word on Twitter since his 2012 tweet.\n\nOn Jan. 25, 2014, Trump tweeted, \"NBC News just called it the great freeze  coldest weather in years. Is our country still spending money on the GLOBAL WARMING HOAX?\"\n\nOn Jan. 29, 2014, Trump tweeted: \"Snowing in Texas and Louisiana, record setting freezing temperatures throughout the country and beyond. Global warming is an expensive hoax!\"\n\nThat same day, he tweeted, \"Give me clean, beautiful and healthy air - not the same old climate change (global warming) bullshit! I am tired of hearing this nonsense.\"\n\nTrump also called climate change a \"hoax\" on theJan. 6, 2014, edition of Fox & Friends.\n\nIn addition, he said on the Sept. 24, 2015, edition of CNNs New Day, \"I dont believe in climate change.\"\n\nAnd on Jan. 18, 2016, Trump said that climate change \"is done for the benefit of China, because China does not do anything to help climate change.\"\n\nWe didnt find Trump using the word \"hoax\" in the months since our previous fact-check, but he hasnt backed off his aggressive skepticism of climate change and policies designed to alleviate it. In fact, hes enshrined opposition to climate change efforts as a key part of his platform.\n\nIn a high-profile speech on energy policy in North Dakota on May 26, 2016, Trump attacked \"draconian climate rules.\" He advocated rescinding \"all the job-destroying Obama executive actions, including the Climate Action Plan\" and said he would \"cancel the Paris Climate Agreement and stop all payments of U.S. tax dollars to U.N. global warming programs.\"\n\n\"President Obama entered the United States into the Paris Climate Accords unilaterally and without the permission of Congress,\" Trump said. \"This agreement gives foreign bureaucrats control over how much energy we use right here in America.\"\n\nClinton said, \"Donald Trump says climate change is a hoax invented by the Chinese.\"\n\nTrump did tweet that view in 2012, though he made efforts earlier this year to describe that remark as a \"joke.\"\n\nHowever, Trump has repeatedly called climate change a \"hoax\" in speeches, tweets and media appearances, and while he hasnt necessarily repeated the charge that China \"invented\" climate change, he has said as recently as Jan. 18, 2016, that action on climate change \"is done for the benefit of China.\"\n\nWe rate the claim Mostly True.','2017-03-25 03:51:14'),(683,89,'d4a4aa97a314a586648c8a68081561cea20f7dbe7dfa940ee0cf388b3ac636e1','f839463708b5451dbcef829b332fdcb1','','','Donald Trumps stated views on global warminghave changed overthe past seven years or so(well leave it to pundits to judgewhether theyve evolved or devolved in that time), as exemplified, on the one hand, byhis endorsement of a 2009 letterurging the U.S. government to invest in a clean energy economy and pass legislation addressing the immediate challenge of climate change, and, on the other, by his November 2012tweet stating that The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive. (Contrary to rumor, Trump did not attempt to delete that tweet years after the fact.)\n\nTrumps current position, as clarifiedby his campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, in a 27 September 2016 interviewwith CNNs Alisyn Camerota, is that climate change exists but is naturally occurring.\n\nCONWAY: That there are shifts naturally occurring.

People in Indonesia (and perhaps elsewhere in tropical Asia) are modifying live monitor lizards to make them look like gargantuan Tokay geckos Gekko gecko.\n\n* Im putting mystery in quotes for the benefit of those people who are already aware of the phenomenon discussed here, worked out what was going on, and made comments about it online. Well done on realising what was going on before the rest of us.\n\nFrom a personal perspective, things began when my good friend and colleague C. M. Kosemen alerted me to an online video in which a man (apparently based in Indonesia) was filmed posing with a live lizard of surreal appearance. According to the man concerned (well call him Satria), the lizard was discovered on a geological survey and is now for sale (thanks to Karl Shuker for translating the text associated with Satrias video).\n\nAs you can see from the screengrabs here, Satrias lizard is a slow-walking, clumsy beast with a spotted dorsal patterning, grey background colour, and cylindrical tail. It has blunt-tipped toes without obvious claws, and you should be able to see from the screengrabs here that it has five digits on both its hands and feet. Furthermore, its digits are right in proportion and position for a lizard (showing that it isnt a weird crocodile or salamander). What makes it incredible is both its size (138 cm in total length: Satria even demonstrates this with a tape measure) and its oversized, broad, blunt-snouted head.\n\nNeedless to say, any gecko this size would be a record-holder. The largest known gecko  the recently extinct Delcourts giant gecko Hoplodactylus delcourti (generally thought to be endemic to New Zealand, though this has been questioned)  has/had a total length of c 60 cm, and the Satria animal is more than twice as long.\n\nThe animal just doesnt look right. Its gargantuan fat head looks somehow out of proportion compared to the rest of it, and it has a blundering, clumsy gait that doesnt look like that of a normal lizard. At one point during the video, the animal quickly shakes its head. This looks aggressive, but also looks like the action performed by an animal trying to shake something off its own body. We never see an open mouth and eyes are not visible.\n\nThis blundering gait and huge, blunt-snouted head actually makes the creature look somewhat like a giant salamander, but that would be equally incredible: not only are there no salamanders of this sort in tropical Asia, the animal has  as weve just seen  five fingers (salamanders have four) and its tail is cylindrical in cross-section, not laterally compressed as is typical for giant salamanders.\n\nAs usual, there have been a few cries of CGI!. But, no (budget, shadows, motion tracking. As Mike Keesey says, its more parsimonious to assume that its a real lizard). In fact, there is a very approximate similarity with the rather short-snouted, fat-headed Delcourts giant gecko. Furthermore, the Satria lizard is Tokay-like in several respects, plus we already know that Tokays are remarkably variable and able to reach surprising sizes (up to 51 cm in total length) and proportions under some circumstances. Could the Satria lizard, then, really be a gargantuan Tokay: a freak individual, or a member of a hitherto overlooked population or closely related species? Well, no.\n\nAs noted by Br?i? B?l?kh?, Raul Epiblast Diaz and other commenters, the animals body and limb proportions, gait and behaviour are all un-gecko-like; additionally, Brian Engh has noted that the toes dont curl upwards with each step as is normal for Tokays and other adhesive-toed geckos, and why dont we see the animal gaping its mouth and preparing to bite when it raises its head? The enormous golden eyes should probably be visible if this were a real Tokay. The tail is long and slim, not fat and pseudo-turnip-shaped as it is in many big geckos. Herpetologist David Kirschner noted that the cautious walk and the way the animal is raising its forelimbs high as it steps indicate that it cannot see well or at all.\n\nBased on all of these bits of data, we seem to be seeing a lizard that has been kitted out to look like a giant Tokay. Its a lizard in some sort of gecko suit. I must point out that this was my immediately favoured option. Within a few seconds of watching the footage, and having ruled out the other contenders that came to mind (giant salamander or genuine fat-headed giant gecko), I was immediately thinking non-gekkotan lizard kitted out to look like a giant Tokay. And Im hardly the first, or only, person to come up with this suggestion, as you can see if you look at the comments attached to the original video (sorry, only available on facebook and not shared here).\n\nWhats especially damning is that there is precedent. Brian and others were able to find a few other videos online of lizards that are transparently non-gekkotan lizards (most likely varanids) modified to look like gargantuan Tokays. Yes, this is a thing. People are modifying varanids (and other big lizards?) to make them look like enormous Tokays. In one video (titled 47 inch Tuko)  it shows a modified varanid thats about 1.1 m long  the people modifying the lizard have stuck flattened flanges of some sort (maybe made from cardboard) onto the toes to make them look more gecko-like. The lizard in this video has a more realistic head than the one in Satrias video, but its long tail, body shape and proportions demonstrate that its definitely a varanid modified to look like a giant Tokay.\n\nIn another video (titled Giant Tokai Gecko, Higanteng Tuko, Real or Fake?) we see what is very obviously a varanid (or other large lizard) in another gecko suit. The animal is restrained by a collar and leash attached to the roof of the vivarium. Empty coke bottles are aligned alongside the animal to provide scale, and were told that its 1.4 m long.\n\nWhy are people doing something that I cannot help but regard as an act of extraordinary and horrible cruelty? It seems that the primary motive is profit: these tortured lizards are for sale, and theyre being fraudulently offered for purchase as novel, valuable animals. I am sad; I feel sorry for the lizards that are being abused here in the pursuit of profit. What happens to them at the end? If they really are encased in the gecko suits described above, theyre unable to feed or drink, and are going to die slowly, in stressed and uncomfortable fashion.\n\nHowever, theres some underlying and fascinating cultural anthropology going on here that Im intrigued about. As Memo and others point out, theres an existing tradition whereby people fake images of gargantuan Tokays, a thing they do partly because Tokays are symbols of luck, prosperity and good health. Karl Shuker wrote a whole article on this issue here.\n\nIn fact, an extraordinary number of modern myths surround these lizards. Theyre said to be able to see into a persons future, to bring great luck, to be the direct descendants of ancient dragons, and, perhaps most remarkably, to somehow cure AIDS. For all these complaints about profiteering and unethical treatment of animals, could there be some well intentioned adoration of geckos here? If so, can it be redirected to better benefit geckos as well as Indonesian people? I mean, its all too easy to point fingers and appoint blame, but can we somehow use this cultural significance to benefit geckos and their conservation?\n\nMany thanks to everyone who discussed this issue with me and used their own expertise to bring this curious phenomenon to attention, in particular Br?i?

Cranking in at nine feet long, growing between 200 and 550 fucking pounds, and hailing from the same part of the world that brought you the unstoppable badassitude of The Raid: Redemption, Komodo Dragon bites have a 90% kill rate and can bring down everything from goats to 1300-pound motherfucking water buffaloes. Theyre awesome swimmers, can outrun wild fucking deer over short distances on land, routinely coldcock rampaging warthogs unconscious by swinging their tails like a two-by-four, are maddeningly-fucking impossible to kill in Far Cry 3, and a helpful pair of them once helped James Bond escape from the clutches of some random ambiguous criminal organization that couldnt find a better hideout than a high-end Chinese restaurant  because if theres one thing Komodo Dragons love more than devouring the entrails of their recently-slain, disease-riddled prey, its sneak-attack eating bad guys in the name of justice and letting spree-killing MI6 agents springboard off their backs to safety like an alcoholic Mario Brother.\n\nThe first thing youll notice about Komodo Dragons is that they honestly look pretty much nothing like the kind of bipedal winged red-scaled fuckers youd expect to be straight-up fragging dipshit D&D Paladins with a 40-foot face full of 20d10 flame (Reflex half). The Indonesians call these varmints Ora, meaning land crocodile, which is a little better, but still doesn\'t quite capture it. \"Death Gecko\" maybe? \"Murdersaurus Rex\"? I don\'t know. Either way, these literally-cold-blooded-killers live on the four southeastern islands of Indonesia  Flora, Gili Motang, Rinca, and of course Komodo, a hot monsoon jungle island five times the size of Manhattan and packed full of ravenous human-murdering reptilian dinosaurs. They were first discovered by the Dutch over a hundred years ago, back in what they call the \"good old days\" when the Dutch were still colonizing islands and exploiting the fuck out them like a maladjusted teenager rocking a turn-based strategy game. In 1926 an expedition under intrepid old-timey pith-helmet-wearing explorer W. Douglas Burden was dispatched to the island to investigate, and tjeu brought back a couple live Dragons to be displayed at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City. Thhe trip was so full of danger, excitment, giant monsters, and over-the-top insanity that fucking the movie King Kong was inspired by this expedition. Im not making this up.\n\nNowadays most of Komodo Island is a touristy national park, which is great for preservation efforts of these prehistoric predators (an estimated 3000-6000 remain in the wild, plus another 200 or so in captivity), but there still have been roughly twenty verified cases where Komodo Dragons killed people and devoured most of their corpses... so dont go thinking these suckers are wussbags and went soft just because theyre an endangered species now or something. Recent research suggests that the Dragons may have originally existed in Australia as well, which makes sense because its fucking Australia, but I guess they dont have a lot of patriotism for the Old Country anymore because one of them almost killed the Crocodile Hunter a few years ago. Komodo Island residents build their houses on stilts for a reason, folks.\n\nKomodo Dragons are short, low to the ground, and way better at stealth and camouflage than youd expect for a fucking nine-foot-long carnivorous reptile with an armored hide and a forked tongue the size of Shaquille O\'Neal\'s Reeboks. An ambush predator by nature, the Komodo Dragon uses its badass gigantic yellow Gene Simmons forked tongue to detect its prey, and its such a hardcore hunter that it can sense blood from almost seven miles away. That\'s like Great White Shark range, and this guy does it through the friggin\' air. If theres no already-dead stuff laying around ready to be eaten (Komodos love leftovers), a Komodo Dragon will lay down in a thick bush, switch on Active Camouflage, and wait for some dumb idiot mammal to wander into its crosshairs. Once its got target lock (typically at around 300 meters), a Komodo Dragon will fucking stampede out of the bush at up to 13 miles an hour and rip snout-first into its prey with a mouth full of curved, backwards-facing serrated teeth that clamp down so hard they can crush bones and rip through flesh. Biting down with an insane 500-600 psi of force (human incisors bite at about 55 psi, fyi), the Komodo Dragon then twists his head and rips at the flesh, trying to create the biggest and most awesomely-gory wound possible. He also has gigantic, powerful claws and a muscle dude tail that hits with the force of a baseball bat and can knock down wild deer, warthogs, and other creatures that would probably kick most humans\' asses in real life hand-to-hand combat. Oh, and if you had any questions about the speed of these things, theres an insane television game show clip called Komodo Dragon Chasing Japanese Woman that should terrify the hell out of you for a large number of reasons (at the time of this writing, the top comment on the video is just \"god damn it, japan\"). Sure, these guys look hilarious when they run, but that Lurch-stomp gets a lot less stupid-looking when its propelling a mouth full of 60+ serrated teeth directly at your balls.\n\nKomodo Dragons eat deer, birds, snakes, crabs, pigs, water buffalo, wild horses, and smaller Komodo Dragons, and have also been known to dig recently-dead humans out of shallow graves to feast on their corpses like some kind of fucked-up Satanic horror movie antagonist. Scientists think they may have also hunted a now-extinct species of elephant called the Stegodon that was goddamned ten feet tall and was also a fucking Elephant with tusks and armored hides and all of the other elephant things. Komodo Dragons only need one pound of food per day to survive, but these cold-blooded meat grinders can rip through 5.5 pounds of beef every minute, and devour 90% of their kills (the only thing they leave is the stomach, because these suckers are so insanely carniverous they don\'t want to eat the plant material in their prey\'s stomach). Komodos can also unhinge their jaw like a snake and open their mouths wide enough to swallow goats whole. Sometimes, if the food isnt going down their throat fast enough, Dragons will ram the food (still in its mouth) into a tree to jam it down the gullet faster. This is probably the most terrifying thing I can think of. Once everythings devoured, they just barf up a mass of horns, hair, and teeth and get on their way.\n\nAnother fun, horrifying fact about Komodo Dragons is that their bite contains a weird anti-coagulant venom that prevents wounds from healing, and their mouths are laced with 57 acceleratedly-virulent strains of bacteria, including e. coli, staph, and the bacterias that cause urinary tract infections and sepsis. So, basically, if the flesh-ripping doesnt kill you, the disease will. It\'s really just a matter of time. When a Komodo Dragon attacks its prey, 70% of its victims are dead in minutes. 20% are dead within hours. Only 10% survive the bite-poison-disease combo.\n\nNow, heres something awesome about this  a Komodo Dragons teeth works basically the same way as Wolverines claws. Most of the time, its teeth are receded back into the gums, making the Komodo Dragon look like a really surprised old man whenever it opens its mouth. Then, when its about to bite, the teeth shoot out through the gums like a cats fucking claws. After festering inside the gingival tissue all day, building up disease, the teeth break the skin, get covered in blood, and then immediately inject a soccer cleat of horrible disease-ridden saw-like bloody teeth into its potential prey, delivering an array of horrible bacteria that all (for some reason we cant quite figure out) multiply at like ten times the normal growth rate of these diseases. This baffles scientists so much that some labs are studying Komodo Dragon saliva in the hopes that they might be able to reverse-engineer that shit into the cure for cancer or other diseases. The Komodo Dragon also naturally injects its venom into the wound, causing it to bleed without healing, which further increases the chance of infection. Theres a reason the Discovery Channel documentary on these fuckers is just called Kills with One Bite.\n\n \n\nLet me try to see if I can illustrate this process for you a little better.\n\nKomodo Dragon society works kind of like Dudebro society, in that theres usually one Alpha who bangs all the chicks and if anyone fucks with him he will bodyslam your ass into submission and then pour beer on you. Komodo Dragon wrestling is fucking awesome, because these two gigantic 9-foot monsters stand up on their back legs, slapfight with their little T-Rex arms, scratch, claw, bite, and seriously suplex each other to the turf WWE style until someone gets pinned. Once you\'re pinned, you gotta give up, otherwise the bigger dudebro dragon kills you and eats you. To protect themselves from their only natural predator (other Komodo Dragons), the Dragon has a thick set of overlapping scales that are reinforced with bone deposits, layed out in an interlacing pattern so that when hit with a claw or bite, it absorbs the hit in a style that is very similar to medieval chain mail armor.\n\nWhen its time to get freaky, Komodo Dragons make out by touching their tongues together like horny teenagers, and (also like teenagers), according to one source I read, mating doesnt last long and is over quickly, which sounds pretty anti-climactic and probably explains why some female Komodos prefer to save themselves the trouble and fertilize their eggs asexually (scientists have no idea how these creatures immaculately conceive, but whatever). Females dont bother building nests or shit either, they just climb up and leave their eggs in these huge nests that are constantly being left behind by some kind of weird species of gigantic Indonesian chicken that apparently also lives on Komodo Island. The female will conquer the nest, dig a couple fake tunnels to trick egg-eating animals, and then deposit between 15 and 30 eggs that are roughly the size of a grapefruit. Komodos are kind of cute as babies, but as soon as theyre born they have to run away and climb up the closest tree before another Komodo wolfs them down because its fucking survival of the fittest out here, fools. Once the baby grows to about 4 feet he gets too fat to climb and has to live on the ground like everyone else.\n\nNow, prepare to be horrified by more pictures of a real-life dinosaur that packs more infectious death than a weapons-grade CDC petri dish.','2017-03-25 03:51:15'),(687,90,'dc6d9cd7fa62f5bab966800d37dd42a3b63637217824755c47e50fbe85ab5451','c69354cd1df4411cba110a0b209a30f4','','','The unlikely secret of the incredible killing power of the Komodo Dragon has finally been revealed - as poor dental hygiene. \n\n\n\nThe Komodo is the world\'s largest lizard, and can grow to 9ft long. \n\n\n\nOn the five small Eastern Indonesian islands it is found, the lizards can kill animals far larger than themselves, including water buffalo, pigs and Timor deer. \n\n\n\nResearchers now believe one of the keys to their killing ability is down to infectious bacteria in their saliva, which can kill prey. \n\n\n\nHowever, the researchers now believe that the bacteria actually spreads from lizard to lizard as well, making the entire community more lethal as their bacteria spread to each other. \n\n\n\nThe model proposes that bacteria spread epidemically among lizard mouths via prey that escape an initial attack, say the researchers from the University of Texas.

With its terrifying looks, Komodo dragons are the least species that can be kept as a pet. No one wants to get spent time with these deadly animals.\n\n There are several lizard species in the world, but Komodo dragon is the most famous due to its massive size and distinct characteristics. Actually, many people confuse them with crocodiles because of its large structure.\n\n You can easily identify these animals by their flat heads, long, thick tails, bowed legs and most predominantly, massive size. Komodo dragons live in four Islands only that includes Rinca, Komodo, Flores and Gili Motang. Komodo dragons have lived for a very long time (millions of years), but its only one century ago when Western scientists discovered them. A plane accidentally landed on the Island.\n\n Since they were discovered in Komodo Island, Komodo dragons were named after it. The name came up after rumors spread that there was a dragon-like creature living on the Indonesian island of Komodo. Since natural disasters and human activities have significantly reduced their population in the past century, Komodo dragons are currently listed as vulnerable.\n\n Komodo dragons are carnivores, meaning they depend solely on meat. Theyre such aggressive hunters such that they can kill and eat large prey like a giant water buffalo, pigs, carrion, deer and even human beings! Surprisingly, they can also eat small dragons.\n\n According to the National Geographic, Komodo dragons can eat 80% of their body weight in a single feeding. Here are some interesting facts about Komodo dragons.\n\n 1. A Komodo dragon is capable of swallowing a whole prey the size of a goat and it will take fifteen to thirty minutes to do so. At times, they will ram their prey against a tree to assist in pushing it down its throat. In some cases, the force it uses to do that is incredibly powerful to an extent the tree used falls.\n\n 2. The skin color of adult Komodo dragons can be reddish, grey or brown. Their young ones have a green body covered with yellow and black stripes.\n\n 3. During their reproductive season, the females lay fifteen to thirty eggs in the abandoned holes underground. The eggs of Komodo dragons look like balloons filled with water. To start a new life, baby lizards use egg tooth to break the shell. Females are always there to offer maximum parental care only until the eggs hatch.\n\n Since adult dragons hunt young dragons, the babies always climb a tree after hatching. Here, they will be safe since adult Komodo dragons cannot climb trees. The young dragons will spend the first few years, away from these threats.\n\n 5. It is normal for Komodo dragons to fight with other dragons. Even though they bite each other when fighting, these creatures are immune to dangerous bacteria from their saliva.\n\n 6. Komodo dragons are known to hunt during the day since they have poor night vision. On top of that, Komodo dragons have the poor sense of hearing.\n\n 7. Did you know that a female Komodo dragon can have virgin births? Yes, they can fertilize their eggs without the help of a male dragon. Creation of an offspring without the assistance of opposite gender is referred to as asexual reproduction. Therefore, Komodo dragons can reproduce both sexually and asexually.\n\n 8. To protect their eggs, Komodo dragon mothers build fake nests to confuse the predators. The female will incubate the eggs for about three months. This group of eggs is referred to as a clutch.\n\n 9. Komodo dragons are cold-blooded animals. Therefore, they spend most of the time in the sun to warm their bodies. Theyll hide in burrows to prevent loss of heat during winter.\n\n 10. Like snakes, Komodo dragons also have the forked tongue. They use it to detect prey by smell. Their sensitive tongues help them identify prey thats four miles away.\n\n 11. They are venomous animals. The venom glands in its jaw produce a variety of toxins which reduce the blood pressure of the prey and even stops blood clotting. Even if the prey manages to escape, itll still die.','2017-03-25 03:51:15'),(689,90,'dc6d9cd7fa62f5bab966800d37dd42a3b63637217824755c47e50fbe85ab5451','37d1fb0f45bc4e29b84294bd2e947fe5','','','The Komodo dragon[4] (Varanus komodoensis), also known as the Komodo monitor, is a large species of lizard found in the Indonesian islands of Komodo, Rinca, Flores, Gili Motang, and Padar.[5] A member of the monitor lizard family Varanidae, it is the largest living species of lizard, growing to a maximum length of 3 metres (10ft) in rare cases and weighing up to approximately 70 kilograms (150lb).[5]\n\nTheir unusually large size has been attributed to island gigantism, since no other carnivorous animals fill the niche on the islands where they live.[6][7] However, recent research suggests the large size of Komodo dragons may be better understood as representative of a relict population of very large varanid lizards that once lived across Indonesia and Australia, most of which, along with other megafauna,[1] died out after the Pleistocene. Fossils very similar to V. komodoensis have been found in Australia dating to greater than 3.8 million years ago, and its body size remained stable on Flores, one of the handful of Indonesian islands where it is currently found, over the last 900,000 years, \"a time marked by major faunal turnovers, extinction of the island\'s megafauna, and the arrival of early hominids by 880 ka [kiloannums].\"[1]\n\nAs a result of their size, these lizards dominate the ecosystems in which they live.[8] Komodo dragons hunt and ambush prey including invertebrates, birds, and mammals. It has been claimed that they have a venomous bite; there are two glands in the lower jaw which secrete several toxic proteins. The biological significance of these proteins is disputed, but the glands have been shown to secrete an anticoagulant. Komodo dragon group behaviour in hunting is exceptional in the reptile world. The diet of big Komodo dragons mainly consists of deer, though they also eat considerable amounts of carrion.[5] Komodo dragons also occasionally attack humans.[9]\n\nMating begins between May and August, and the eggs are laid in September. About 20 eggs are deposited in abandoned megapode nests or in a self-dug nesting hole.[5] The eggs are incubated for seven to eight months, hatching in April, when insects are most plentiful. Young Komodo dragons are vulnerable and therefore dwell in trees, safe from predators and cannibalistic adults. They take 8 to 9 years to mature, and are estimated to live up to 30 years.[5]\n\nKomodo dragons were first recorded by Western scientists in 1910.[10] Their large size and fearsome reputation make them popular zoo exhibits. In the wild, their range has contracted due to human activities, and they are listed as vulnerable by the IUCN.[2] They are protected under Indonesian law, and a national park, Komodo National Park, was founded to aid protection efforts.\n\nThe Komodo dragon is also known as the Komodo monitor or the Komodo Island monitor in scientific literature,[4] although this is not very common. To the natives of Komodo Island, it is referred to as ora, buaya darat (land crocodile), or biawak raksasa (giant monitor).[11][12]\n\nThe evolutionary development of the Komodo dragon started with the Varanus genus, which originated in Asia about 40 million years ago and migrated to Australia, where it evolved into giant forms (the largest of all being the recently extinct Megalania), helped by the absence of competing placental carnivorans. Around 15 million years ago, a collision between Australia and Southeast Asia allowed these larger varanids to move back into what is now the Indonesian archipelago, extending their range as far east as the island of Timor. The Komodo dragon was believed to have differentiated from its Australian ancestors 4 million years ago. However, recent fossil evidence from Queensland suggests the Komodo dragon actually evolved in Australia before spreading to Indonesia.[1][13] Dramatic lowering of sea level during the last glacial period uncovered extensive stretches of continental shelf that the Komodo dragon colonised, becoming isolated in their present island range as sea levels rose afterwards.[1][12]\n\nIn the wild, an adult Komodo dragon usually weighs around 70kg (150lb), although captive specimens often weigh more.[14] According to the Guinness Book of World Records, an average adult male will weigh 79 to 91kg (174 to 201lb) and measure 2.59m (8.5ft), while an average female will weigh 68 to 73kg (150 to 161lb) and measure 2.29m (7.5ft).[15] The largest verified wild specimen was 3.13m (10.3ft) long and weighed 166kg (366lb), including undigested food.[12] The Komodo dragon has a tail as long as its body, as well as about 60 frequently replaced, serrated teeth that can measure up to 2.5cm (1in) in length. Its saliva is frequently blood-tinged, because its teeth are almost completely covered by gingival tissue that is naturally lacerated during feeding.[16] It also has a long, yellow, deeply forked tongue.[12] Komodo dragon skin is reinforced by armoured scales, which contain tiny bones called osteoderms that function as a sort of natural chain-mail.[17][18] This rugged hide makes Komodo dragon skin poorly suited for making into leather.\n\nAs with other varanids, Komodo dragons have only a single ear bone, the stapes, for transferring vibrations from the tympanic membrane to the cochlea. This arrangement means they are likely restricted to sounds in the 400 to 2,000 hertz range, compared to humans who hear between 20 and 20,000 hertz.[12][19] It was formerly thought to be deaf when a study reported no agitation in wild Komodo dragons in response to whispers, raised voices, or shouts. This was disputed when London Zoological Garden employee Joan Proctor trained a captive specimen to come out to feed at the sound of her voice, even when she could not be seen.[20]\n\nThe Komodo dragon can see objects as far away as 300m (980ft), but because its retinas only contain cones, it is thought to have poor night vision. It can see in colour, but has poor visual discrimination of stationary objects.[21]\n\nThe Komodo dragon uses its tongue to detect, taste, and smell stimuli, as with many other reptiles, with the vomeronasal sense using the Jacobson\'s organ, rather than using the nostrils.[22] With the help of a favorable wind and its habit of swinging its head from side to side as it walks, a Komodo dragon may be able to detect carrion from 49.5km (2.55.9mi) away.[21] It only has a few taste buds in the back of its throat.[22] Its scales, some of which are reinforced with bone, have sensory plaques connected to nerves to facilitate its sense of touch. The scales around the ears, lips, chin, and soles of the feet may have three or more sensory plaques.[16]\n\nThe Komodo dragon prefers hot and dry places, and typically lives in dry, open grassland, savanna, and tropical forest at low elevations. As an ectotherm, it is most active in the day, although it exhibits some nocturnal activity. Komodo dragons are solitary, coming together only to breed and eat. They are capable of running rapidly in brief sprints up to 20km/h (12mph), diving up to 4.5m (15ft), and climbing trees proficiently when young through use of their strong claws.[14] To catch out-of-reach prey, the Komodo dragon may stand on its hind legs and use its tail as a support.[20] As it matures, its claws are used primarily as weapons, as its great size makes climbing impractical.[16]\n\nFor shelter, the Komodo dragon digs holes that can measure from 1 to 3m (3.3 to 9.8ft) wide with its powerful forelimbs and claws.[23] Because of its large size and habit of sleeping in these burrows, it is able to conserve body heat throughout the night and minimise its basking period the morning after.[24] The Komodo dragon hunts in the afternoon, but stays in the shade during the hottest part of the day.[25] These special resting places, usually located on ridges with cool sea breezes, are marked with droppings and are cleared of vegetation. They serve as strategic locations from which to ambush deer.[26]\n\nKomodo dragons are carnivores. Although they eat mostly carrion,[6] they will also ambush live prey with a stealthy approach. When suitable prey arrives near a dragon\'s ambush site, it will suddenly charge at the animal and go for the underside or the throat.[16] It is able to locate its prey using its keen sense of smell, which can locate a dead or dying animal from a range of up to 9.5km (5.9mi). Komodo dragons have been observed knocking down large pigs and deer with their strong tails.[27][28]\n\nKomodo dragons eat by tearing large chunks of flesh and swallowing them whole while holding the carcass down with their forelegs. For smaller prey up to the size of a goat, their loosely articulated jaws, flexible skulls, and expandable stomachs allow them to swallow prey whole. The vegetable contents of the stomach and intestines are typically avoided.[26] Copious amounts of red saliva the Komodo dragons produce help to lubricate the food, but swallowing is still a long process (1520minutes to swallow a goat). A Komodo dragon may attempt to speed up the process by ramming the carcass against a tree to force it down its throat, sometimes ramming so forcefully, the tree is knocked down.[26] A small tube under the tongue that connects to the lungs allows it to breathe while swallowing.[16] After eating up to 80% of its body weight in one meal,[8] it drags itself to a sunny location to speed digestion, as the food could rot and poison the dragon if left undigested for too long. Because of their slow metabolism, large dragons can survive on as few as 12 meals a year.[16] After digestion, the Komodo dragon regurgitates a mass of horns, hair, and teeth known as the gastric pellet, which is covered in malodorous mucus. After regurgitating the gastric pellet, it rubs its face in the dirt or on bushes to get rid of the mucus, suggesting it does not relish the scent of its own excretions.[16]\n\nThe largest animals eat first, while the smaller ones follow a hierarchy. The largest male asserts his dominance and the smaller males show their submission by use of body language and rumbling hisses. Dragons of equal size may resort to \"wrestling\". Losers usually retreat, though they have been known to be killed and eaten by victors.[29]\n\nThe Komodo dragon\'s diet is wide-ranging, and includes invertebrates, other reptiles (including smaller Komodo dragons), birds, bird eggs, small mammals, monkeys, wild boar, goats, deer, horses, and water buffalo.[31] Young Komodos will eat insects, eggs, geckos, and small mammals.[6] Occasionally, they attack and bite humans (see first paragraphs of this article). Sometimes they consume human corpses, digging up bodies from shallow graves.[20] This habit of raiding graves caused the villagers of Komodo to move their graves from sandy to clay ground and pile rocks on top of them to deter the lizards.[26] The Komodo dragon may have evolved to feed on the extinct dwarf elephant Stegodon that once lived on Flores, according to evolutionary biologist Jared Diamond.[32]\n\nThe Komodo dragon drinks by sucking water into its mouth via buccal pumping (a process also used for respiration), lifting its head, and letting the water run down its throat.[28]\n\nAlthough previous studies proposed that Komodo dragon saliva contains a variety of highly septic bacteria that would help to bring down prey,[29][33] research in 2013 suggested that the bacteria in the mouths of Komodo dragons are ordinary and similar to those found in other carnivores. They actually have surprisingly good mouth hygiene. As Bryan Fry put it: \"After they are done feeding, they will spend 10 to 15 minutes lip-licking and rubbing their head in the leaves to clean their mouth... Unlike people have been led to believe, they do not have chunks of rotting flesh from their meals on their teeth, cultivating bacteria.\" The observation of prey dying of sepsis would then be explained by the natural instinct of water buffalos, who are not native to the islands where the Komodo dragon lives, to run into water when attacked. The warm, faeces-filled water would then cause the infections.[34] The study used samples from 16 captive dragons (10 adults and six neonates) from three U.S. zoos.[35]\n\nIn late 2005, researchers at the University of Melbourne speculated the perentie (Varanus giganteus), other species of monitors, and agamids may be somewhat venomous. The team believes the immediate effects of bites from these lizards were caused by mild envenomation. Bites on human digits by a lace monitor (V. varius), a Komodo dragon, and a spotted tree monitor (V. scalaris) all produced similar effects: rapid swelling, localised disruption of blood clotting, and shooting pain up to the elbow, with some symptoms lasting for several hours.[36]\n\nIn 2009, the same researchers published further evidence demonstrating Komodo dragons possess a venomous bite. MRI scans of a preserved skull showed the presence of two glands in the lower jaw. The researchers extracted one of these glands from the head of a terminally ill dragon in the Singapore Zoological Gardens, and found it secreted several different toxic proteins. The known functions of these proteins include inhibition of blood clotting, lowering of blood pressure, muscle paralysis, and the induction of hypothermia, leading to shock and loss of consciousness in envenomated prey.[37][38] As a result of the discovery, the previous theory that bacteria were responsible for the deaths of Komodo victims was disputed.[39]\n\nOther scientists have stated that this allegation of venom glands \"has had the effect of underestimating the variety of complex roles played by oral secretions in the biology of reptiles, produced a very narrow view of oral secretions and resulted in misinterpretation of reptilian evolution\". According to these scientists \"reptilian oral secretions contribute to many biological roles other than to quickly dispatch prey\". These researchers concluded that, \"Calling all in this clade venomous implies an overall potential danger that does not exist, misleads in the assessment of medical risks, and confuses the biological assessment of squamate biochemical systems\".[40] Evolutionary biologist Schwenk says that even if the lizards have venom-like proteins in their mouths they may be using them for a different function, and he doubts venom is necessary to explain the effect of a Komodo dragon bite, arguing that shock and blood loss are the primary factors.[41][42]\n\nMating occurs between May and August, with the eggs laid in September.[12] During this period, males fight over females and territory by grappling with one another upon their hind legs, with the loser eventually being pinned to the ground. These males may vomit or defecate when preparing for the fight.[20] The winner of the fight will then flick his long tongue at the female to gain information about her receptivity.[8] Females are antagonistic and resist with their claws and teeth during the early phases of courtship. Therefore, the male must fully restrain the female during coitus to avoid being hurt. Other courtship displays include males rubbing their chins on the female, hard scratches to the back, and licking.[43] Copulation occurs when the male inserts one of his hemipenes into the female\'s cloaca.[21] Komodo dragons may be monogamous and form \"pair bonds\", a rare behavior for lizards.[20]\n\nFemale Komodos lay their eggs from August to September and may use several types of locality; in one study, 60% laid their eggs in the nests of orange-footed scrubfowl (a moundbuilder or megapode), 20% on ground level and 20% in hilly areas.[44] The females make many camouflage nests/holes to prevent other dragons from eating the eggs.[45] Clutches contain an average of 20 eggs, which have an incubation period of 78 months.[20] Hatching is an exhausting effort for the neonates, which break out of their eggshells with an egg tooth that falls off soon after. After cutting themselves out, the hatchlings may lie in their eggshells for hours before starting to dig out of the nest. They are born quite defenseless and are vulnerable to predation.[29] Sixteen youngsters from a single nest were on average 46.5cm long and weighed 105.1grams.[44]\n\nYoung Komodo dragons spend much of their first few years in trees, where they are relatively safe from predators, including cannibalistic adults, as juvenile dragons make up 10% of their diets.[20] The habit of cannibalism may be advantageous in sustaining the large size of adults, as medium-sized prey on the islands is rare.[27] When the young approach a kill, they roll around in faecal matter and rest in the intestines of eviscerated animals to deter these hungry adults.[20] Komodo dragons take approximately 8 to 9 years to mature, and may live for up to 30 years.[5]\n\nA Komodo dragon at London Zoo named Sungai laid a clutch of eggs in late 2005 after being separated from male company for more than two years. Scientists initially assumed she had been able to store sperm from her earlier encounter with a male, an adaptation known as superfecundation.[46] On 20 December 2006, it was reported that Flora, a captive Komodo dragon living in the Chester Zoo in England, was the second known Komodo dragon to have laid unfertilised eggs: she laid 11 eggs, and seven of them hatched, all of them male.[47] Scientists at Liverpool University in England performed genetic tests on three eggs that collapsed after being moved to an incubator, and verified Flora had never been in physical contact with a male dragon. After Flora\'s eggs\' condition had been discovered, testing showed Sungai\'s eggs were also produced without outside fertilization.[48] On 31 January 2008, the Sedgwick County Zoo in Wichita, Kansas, became the first zoo in the Americas to document parthenogenesis in Komodo dragons. The zoo has two adult female Komodo dragons, one of which laid about 17 eggs on 1920 May 2007. Only two eggs were incubated and hatched due to space issues; the first hatched on 31 January 2008, while the second hatched on 1 February. Both hatchlings were males.[49][50]\n\nKomodo dragons have the ZW chromosomal sex-determination system, as opposed to the mammalian XY system. Male progeny prove Flora\'s unfertilised eggs were haploid (n) and doubled their chromosomes later to become diploid (2n) (by being fertilised by a polar body, or by chromosome duplication without cell division), rather than by her laying diploid eggs by one of the meiosis reduction-divisions in her ovaries failing. When a female Komodo dragon (with ZW sex chromosomes) reproduces in this manner, she provides her progeny with only one chromosome from each of her pairs of chromosomes, including only one of her two sex chromosomes. This single set of chromosomes is duplicated in the egg, which develops parthenogenetically. Eggs receiving a Z chromosome become ZZ (male); those receiving a W chromosome become WW and fail to develop,[51][52] meaning that only males are produced by parthenogenesis in this species.\n\nIt has been hypothesised that this reproductive adaptation allows a single female to enter an isolated ecological niche (such as an island) and by parthenogenesis produce male offspring, thereby establishing a sexually reproducing population (via reproduction with her offspring that can result in both male and female young).[51] Despite the advantages of such an adaptation, zoos are cautioned that parthenogenesis may be detrimental to genetic diversity.[53]\n\nKomodo dragons were first documented by Europeans in 1910, when rumors of a \"land crocodile\" reached Lieutenant van Steyn van Hensbroek of the Dutch colonial administration.[54] Widespread notoriety came after 1912, when Peter Ouwens, the director of the Zoological Museum at Bogor, Java, published a paper on the topic after receiving a photo and a skin from the lieutenant, as well as two other specimens from a collector.[3] The first two live Komodo dragons to arrive in Europe were exhibited in the Reptile House at London Zoo when it opened in 1927.[55] Joan Beauchamp Procter made some of the earliest observations of these animals in captivity and she demonstrated the behaviour of one of these animals at a Scientific Meeting of the Zoological Society of London in 1928.[56] The Komodo dragon was the driving factor for an expedition to Komodo Island by W. Douglas Burden in 1926. After returning with 12 preserved specimens and 2 live ones, this expedition provided the inspiration for the 1933 movie King Kong.[57] It was also Burden who coined the common name \"Komodo dragon.\"[25] Three of his specimens were stuffed and are still on display in the American Museum of Natural History.[58]\n\nThe Dutch, realizing the limited number of individuals in the wild, outlawed sport hunting and heavily limited the number of individuals taken for scientific study. Collecting expeditions ground to a halt with the occurrence of World War II, not resuming until the 1950s and 1960s, when studies examined the Komodo dragon\'s feeding behavior, reproduction, and body temperature. At around this time, an expedition was planned in which a long-term study of the Komodo dragon would be undertaken. This task was given to the Auffenberg family, who stayed on Komodo Island for 11 months in 1969. During their stay, Walter Auffenberg and his assistant Putra Sastrawan captured and tagged more than 50 Komodo dragons.[59] The research from the Auffenberg expedition would prove to be enormously influential in raising Komodo dragons in captivity.[60] Research after that of the Auffenberg family has shed more light on the nature of the Komodo dragon, with biologists such as Claudio Ciofi continuing to study the creatures.[61]\n\nThe Komodo dragon is a vulnerable species and is on the IUCN Red List.[2] The Komodo National Park was founded in 1980 to protect Komodo dragon populations on islands including Komodo, Rinca, and Padar.[62] Later, the Wae Wuul and Wolo Tado Reserves were opened on Flores to aid with Komodo dragon conservation.[61]\n\nKomodo dragons avoid encounters with humans. Juveniles are very shy and will flee quickly into a hideout if a human comes closer than about 100 metres (330ft). Older animals will also retreat from humans from a shorter distance away. If cornered, they will react aggressively by gaping their mouth, hissing, and swinging their tail. If they are disturbed further, they may start an attack and bite. Although there are anecdotes of unprovoked Komodo dragons attacking or preying on humans, most of these reports are either not reputable or caused by defensive bites. Only a very few cases are truly the result of unprovoked attacks by abnormal individuals, which lost their fear towards humans.[29]\n\nVolcanic activity, earthquakes, loss of habitat, fire,[16][61] loss of prey due to poaching, tourism, and illegal poaching of the dragons themselves have all contributed to the vulnerable status of the Komodo dragon. Under Appendix I of CITES (the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species), commercial trade of skins or specimens is illegal.[63][64]\n\nIn 2013, total population in the wild was assessed as 3,222 individuals, declining to 3,092 in 2014 and 3,014 in 2015. Populations remained relatively stable on the bigger islands (Komodo and Rinca), but decreased on smaller island such as Nusa Kode and Gili Motang, likely due to diminishing prey availability.[65] On Padar, a former population of the Komodo dragon became extinct, of which the last individuals were seen in 1975.[66] It is widely assumed that the Komodo dragon died out on Padar after a strong decline of the populations of large ungulate prey, for which poaching was most likely responsible.[67]\n\nKomodo dragons have long been great zoo attractions, where their size and reputation make them popular exhibits. They are, however, rare in zoos because they are susceptible to infection and parasitic disease if captured from the wild, and do not readily reproduce.[11] As of May 2009, there were 13 European, 2 African, 35 North American, 1 Singaporean, and 2 Australian institutions that kept Komodo dragons.[68]\n\nThe first Komodo dragons were displayed at London Zoo in 1927. A Komodo dragon was exhibited in 1934 at the National Zoo in Washington, D.C., but it lived for only two years. More attempts to exhibit Komodo dragons were made, but the lifespan of these animals was very short, averaging five years in the National Zoological Park. Studies done by Walter Auffenberg, which were documented in his book The Behavioral Ecology of the Komodo Monitor, eventually allowed for more successful managing and reproducing of the dragons in captivity.[60]\n\nA variety of behaviors have been observed from captive specimens. Most individuals are relatively tame within a short time,[69][70] and are capable of recognising individual humans and discriminating between familiar keepers.[71] Komodo dragons have also been observed to engage in play with a variety of objects, including shovels, cans, plastic rings, and shoes. This behavior does not seem to be \"food-motivated predatory behavior\".[8][12][72]\n\nEven seemingly docile dragons may become unpredictably aggressive, especially when the animal\'s territory is invaded by someone unfamiliar. In June 2001, a Komodo dragon seriously injured Phil Bronstein, the then husband of actress Sharon Stone, when he entered its enclosure at the Los Angeles Zoo after being invited in by its keeper. Bronstein was bitten on his bare foot, as the keeper had told him to take off his white shoes and socks, which the keeper stated could potentially excite the Komodo dragon as they were the same colour as the white rats the zoo fed the dragon.[73][74] Although he escaped, Bronstein needed to have several tendons in his foot reattached surgically.[75]','2017-03-25 03:51:15'),(690,91,'e013b2f26f48214b669bcc1a30acc7d5f32b24035766cd980b2a06c092c2faa8','4aacfa1a3169479481c435d2a9e852bd','','','The myth is that its illegal to eat mince pies on Christmas Day.

I have watched incredulously as a tall, beautiful soldier in his prime was gunned down while peacefully guarding a monument in Ottawa. I have refused to watch as Daniel Pearl would be the first of many ISIS victims  throat slit, terror reverberating around the world, establishing a new normal.\n\nThere is something so visceral about horror and fear. It causes us to fold in half, to circle the wagons, to batten down the hatches and seek to eliminate all real and potential threats. Suspicion and survival take over. Our hearts grow small. There is no room for compassion when you have been struck in such a cowardly way and you dont know where the next blow is coming from. When young men and women are gunned down for no reason at all, logic, too, tends to walk away. Vicious thoughts of revenge and destruction take over. You want to retaliate, to strike back; to keep this from happening to you and your loved ones.\n\nPolice immediately started investigating to find out who the terrorists were. ISIS quickly claimed responsibility. A lone Syrian passport was found near the body of one of the men who had detonated himself.\n\nI knew immediately what was coming next.\n\nWithin hours, pundits were urging politicians to close the doors to Syrian refugees. Within days, a Peterborough mosque had been vandalized with Molotov cocktails, a Muslim woman trying to pick up her kids in Toronto was viciously attacked as two men yelled: You terrorist, you dont belong here. You piece of Sh*!@, go back home, and a Muslim woman was pushed into an oncoming train in London (miraculously she survived). It would appear that nothing vindicates and avenges the cowardly acts of terrorists against innocent people like more cowardly acts against more innocent people\n\nWithin days, a number of U.S. governors had joined in a cacophonous choir, informing President Obama that their states would not be letting in Syrian refugees, slated to soon be arriving. Never mind that the U.S. Constitution stipulates that its not up to them to decide that, they decided to pander to voters fears and appear tough on crime on the backs of innocent refugees who are now being re-victimized, scapegoated, and demonized for absolutely no reason at all.\n\nBut what if there are terrorists hiding among Syrian refugees? has been the question on the lips offar too many people these past few days. For the sake of maintaining my sanity and focusing on those minds I can  perhaps  change, I will refrain from focusing on the vile and ignorant Islamophobia masquerading as a legitimate security concern that Ive seen blow up on my social media feed. Those people are hopeless and I no longer want to spend any time educating them because their bigotry and prejudice overrides any factual information. They will believe what they will believe and nothing anyone tells them will change their minds.\n\nFor the rest of you, the ones legitimately concerned about a possible infiltration of terrorists entering our countries disguised as Syrian refugees, here are a few points that you desperately need toread. I think it will go a long way towards easing your fears:\n\nNot true. All Paris attackers identified so far are European nationals, according to top EU officials. While some people are frantically calling for us to close our doors, because they fear terrorists are infiltrating Europe by posing as refugees, in most cases its unfortunately been proven that its the other way around and most terrorists have been homegrown  including our own two lone wolf incidents in Canada. All the attackers identified in the Paris massacre so far were born in Belgium and France, posing much more complex questions for our society with regards to real cultural and religious integration that I suspect far too many are not willing to acknowledge or deal with honestly. Should we call for a ban on French and Belgium nationals? Funny how no one has suggested that solution.\n\nThe number of refugees in the U.S. since 9/11 who have turned out to be terrorists? A big fat ZERO. The same number, by the way, applies for the large number of Bosnian Muslims who came to Canada and the States after the Bosnian civil war.\n\nAs for that Syrian passport that someone on their way to blow themselves up to a million pieces conveniently and irrationally felt compelled to carry with him (was he on his way to an all-inclusive afterwards and needed to quickly dash to the airport? Did no one seriously question how nothing remained of this man, yet a paper document could survive a blast this powerful? I have sooo many questions and none of them involve Syrian refugees). The latest reports seem to point to that passport being a fake, which is no surprise considering there is a burgeoning trade at the moment. It would not strike me in the least bit unlikely or exaggerated that a terrorist group would seek to demonize Syrians who betrayed them because they are attempting to flee their califate. If you cant terrorize and kill them at home, why not ensure they are denied anywhere else to go? Its brilliantly hateful and easily conceivable considering the climate of suspicion currently alive and well in the world.\n\nActually, its way tougher for someone to enter Canada as a refugee than as a visitor. Stop reading silly articles and dubious links chockfull of misinformation shared by your bigoted friend on Facebook and take the time to read real facts about refugees and refugee claimants in Canada from the Canadian Council for Refugees, a national non-profit umbrella organization in Canada. According to their information, the refugee determination process involves security checks by CSIS and the RCMP, fingerprinting and interviews. It is not likely that a person intending to commit a violent act would expose themselves to such detailed examinations. The Immigration and Refugee Protection Act excludes refugee claimants if they are found to be inadmissible on the basis of security, serious criminality, organized criminality or human rights violations. The Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS) checks all refugee claimants on arrival in Canada. Since the screening was put in place in 2001, its worth reminding people that the number of claimants found to represent any kind of security concern has been statistically insignificant.\n\nActually, thats not true. According to a recent CTV interview with Peter Showler, the former chair of Canadas Immigration and Refugee Board, the UNHCR has already triaged the refugees and assessed those that would make ideal candidates for re-settlement. They, in turn, are then interviewed and assessed by Canadian Visa officers and finally by Canadian security agencies. The vast majority of the 25,000 Syrian refugees Canada would be accepting fled Syria years ago (they fled to neighbouring Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, and Iraq) and have been in neighbouring countries as refugees for four years. To quote Showler: We know who those people are. So its actually quite easy to identify 25,000 that fit into extremely low-risk security categories.\n\nAlso, in addition, and I think worth mentioning for those citing all sorts of convenient reasons for preventing them from coming here, many of the refugees now arriving to Canada are sponsored. Sponsored refugees are not even entitled to government assistance (including provincial assistance) during the period of their sponsorship (usually for one year after arrival in Canada). Their income support must be provided by their sponsors and/or volunteer community groups.\n\nIn essence, many of those freaking out right now and trying to shut down our borders or delay the arrival of people who desperately need to come here, are asking this very question. Can we find a way to eliminate the risk factor to helping people? The answer is no. Take a quick look at the world around you and tell me how you think you can inoculate yourself from all threats real or otherwise, miniscule or major? Im sorry, you just cant.\n\nWeve allowed the government increased surveillance access to our most private conversations, we allow security guards to pat us down and scan our bodies through X-ray machines, we take off our shoes, we suffer through a myriad of questions while crossing the border, we travel on trains that have signs saying If you see something, say something. We believe those actions make us safer. We believe they reduce the risk, the fear, the possibility of another plane or another building or another human being going down. But the sheer truth of it all is that they help a little to make things safer, but mostly just create the illusion of safety in most of these cases.\n\nBecause deep down inside we know that no security or safety check in the world can predict or prevent a crazed fanatic or raging madman from entering a room full of people and blowing himself up. We know that. Sure, we do what we can, but at the end of the day life is a series of random luck chances and, as the Paris incident just demonstrated, death can simply be about nothing more than being at the wrong place at the wrong time.\n\nNow, knowing all that, what do you do about it? You put in place the best security plan you can muster and you go on about your life. And you remain human. You prove yourself a thousand times better than the evil in this world. You go on. Despite the fear and the horror and the paralyzing doubts, you move on and you refuse to recoil and react in horror and hatred, the way these assholes predictably expect you to.\n\nSince 2011, 12 million Syrians have fled their homes because of conflict, making it the worlds worst humanitarian crisis; half of those fleeing are children. More than 3,200 have perished this year alone attempting to cross into Europe via treacherous sea crossing because there is no home to return to and their children are a lost generation, wasting away in camps receiving no education and having no hope.\n\nWith winter coming, and with every day and week a matter of life and death for many of these people, it is unconscionable that we are delaying admitting them. No rational piece of evidence exists to substantiate such a delay and all safety requests are based on nothing but knee-jerk reactions and fear-based rhetoric. Syrian refugees are ESCAPING the horror Parisians experienced for one night. That carnage, that fear, those tears, and that despair? These families have lived it for years. They have watched loved ones die, their homes destroyed, their hope for a future extinguished, and now are watching from the sidelines as the world vilifies them for something they had absolutely nothing to do with.\n\nIf we dont collectively snap out of it and find our humanity, we will (to use a popular phrase circulating often after 9/11) have let the terrorists win. We will have let fear and hate win over hope and love. If we claim to be better than them, we need to be fucking better than them. Otherwise we will look back on this the way Canadians now shamefully look back at the story of the St. Louis in 1939, when 907 Jewish refugees aboard the German transatlantic liner were seeking sanctuary from Nazi Germany and were callously turned away. The ship sailed back to Europe, where 254 would later die in concentration camps.\n\nI dont know about you, but I dont want to be part of a country that turns people in need away. If we aspire to learn from our collective failings in the past, how about we start now?','2017-03-25 03:51:15'),(700,92,'e9c0b0a4fd7bc2435773c971ae400cf2ecbb24ff8285715ed9ebc63b22e637a6','8885c2f7b0be40c5b54b2c79d203559e','','','I am a Deputy and personally dealt with 3 separate calls last night dealing with clown harassments.

Parent discipline is often better than putting them through the system. He was standing in the street and also approached cars as they were stopped at a light. One car with 3 teenage girls actually ran the red light because they were scared.\n\n \n\n 2nd kid was not being cooperative and ended up in JDH on multiple charges. He was actually knocking on people\'s doors at 2 AM and telling them to let him in. A single mother and her 2 young daughters were petrified. I feel for the mother as her daughters are going to have nightmares and may need counseling to deal with the trauma.\n\n \n\n I truly hope this stops. Hoax or no hoax, it is inciting fear amongst many of our kids. I have young children who are scared and have been sleeping on our floor. CB, I think you can relate to my situation. Three nights ago, my granddaughter was walking from her evening class to her car, when one of these people dressed in a clown outfit jumped out at her. It was a case of harassment for sure.

Another was reportedly spotted outside an elementary school in Winston-Salem, Fox News reports.\n\nPolice in the city increased their patrols in the wake of the reports. One man was arrested earlier this month in the area for falsely reporting a sighting.\n\nA clown dressed in an orange jumpsuit with spiked air and a demonic mask was spotted cycling down the street in Yuma, Arizona while a man in Kentucky was arrested after being found lurking in a wooded area in full costume.\n\nJonathan Martin, 20, was charged with wearing a mask in a public place and disorderly conduct.\n\nHe was found in \'full clown costume\', crouching among trees by an apartment complex, police say.\n\nOther cases have been fatal.

Theyve managed to capture many a news headline and plenty of social media attention during the latter end of the year.\n\nThe problem with clowns, naturally, is that theyre the perfect fodder for tabloid sensationalism, the fake news (entertainment) industry and a slew of pranksters, both online and off. And when all of these people meet at the Halloween party, mass hysteria will inevitably follow.\n\nAnd so will the rumours, which have been in overdrive. Clowns invade Canada and embark on murder sprees. Clown serial killer on the loose in the US. Congress pass a law allowing police to shoot suspicious clowns. Justin Trudeau claims anyone dressed as a clown will be fined $10,000. A woman wearing heavy make-up mistaken for clown and shot in a parking lot?\n\nSo, its time to work out whats real and whats not. But for those with either a short attention span or in need of quick facts\n\nTLDR: There are no killer clowns on murder sprees, and most of the rumours circulating about either clowns or innocent people being murdered are false. However there have been plenty of clown sightings, and some reports of clowns trying to lure children into the woods, and the mass hysteria surrounding all of this is certainly real, resulting in multiple arrests (so read our warning at the end!)\n\nOkay, for those interested in reading a little further lets start with whats false\n\nUS killer clowns on killing spree in Canada\n\nReports that clowns from the United States have taken up North and killed 23 people in Canada originate from a fake news website called The Global Sun which describes itself as a satire website which posts made-up stories that should not be taken seriously. Of course if the story was real, it would have gotten mainstream media attention, which it hasnt.\n\n14 dead and 36 injured in US after killer clown spree?\n\nAgain, this story originates from The Global Sun fake news website. It isnt real at all.\n\nClaims that Justin Trudeau announced that anyone caught dressed as a clown will be fined $10,000 and arrested also originate from the same fake news website. Again, it isnt true whatsoever.\n\nWomen with heavy make-up mistaken for clown and shot dead or attacked?\n\nClaims that women are being shot dead or attacked after being mistaken for clowns are also fake. The entertainment site claimed that two women, Kelly Perez and Melissa Reyes, were attacked/shot after being mistaken for clowns, but both came from the site TheNoChill.com with describes itself as a notorious entertainment website, a disclaimer that can be found at the bottom of each page.\n\nAgain this is story that claims police can shoot malicious or suspicious clowns started from a fake news website, the DailyFinesser.com , a site that claims it is for entertainment purposes only.\n\nClaims that a clown known as GodKing left a threatening note to cancel Halloween or people will get killed started from a known satire site TMZWorldNews.com and is not real.\n\nOne only needs to take a quick glance on any number of YouTube channels, Twitter feeds or Facebook pages dedicated to archiving recent clown sightings to determine that yes, the sightings of creepy looking clowns as gone up. Schools have gone into lockdown, police departments across the US and Canada are on high alert and even students are on vigilante hunts.\n\nThe run up to Halloween no doubt plays a crucial part to this terrifying trend. This is the perfect time for budding YouTube stars to play their pranks, looking to make their videos go viral. Clowns have long been the ideal subject matter for many a video prank, and YouTube has long been littered with videos featuring clowns wielding chainsaws, beating up dead bodies, jumping from trees or from behind bushes, or simply staring menacingly at passers-by. And as Halloween approaches, the number of people creating these sorts of videos will only escalate.\n\nOf course social media plays an important role too. As soon as reports start flooding in about spooky clown sightings and the tabloids and fake news industry begin their input, that information gets disseminated virally across platforms like Twitter and Facebook, and everyone wants to be a part of the trend. This no doubt provides sufficient motivation for many others to get involved too, resulting in more people dressing up, and fuelling the hysteria.\n\nClowns attempt to lure children into the woods?\n\nReports that clowns were trying to lure children into woods in Greenville, South Carolina, are real, although these occurred in August 2016, and there has been no trend of similar incidents. Police investigated the reports, though no arrests were made. However a local property manager did warn residents with a letter.\n\nVideos of an apparent hunt for clowns at Penn State University appears to be real, though at this time it doesnt appear that anything came from it, and no one was reported to have been hurt.\n\nSchools have gone into lockdown\n\nA number of schools across the United States have ended up in lockdown after reports of nearby clown sightings. Many of these however turned out to be hoaxes.\n\nPeople have been arrested for dressing as clowns\n\nMany people dressed as clowns have indeed been arrested, though these arrests are linked to pranksters making a nuisance of themselves, like these kids from Arkansas terrorising members of the public with a horn.\n\nWhile the killer clown murdering sprees are not real, participating in this sort of mass hysteria can have very real consequences. As we stated above, people have been arrested, both for playing pranks and for involving themselves in clown related threats. Given the number of hunts and current state of anxious awareness regarding this frenzy and the many alarming mistruths it has managed to spawn, it appears inevitable that at some point, an innocent prank could go very wrong indeed, and people could get hurt.\n\nUltimately, the take home of this article is that there is no epidemic of killer clowns on the loose murdering people. While isolated incidents can (and have in the past) occurred involving physical altercations with people dressed in clown outfits, this is ultimately just mass hysteria, and readers are strongly advised not to get carried away with it all.\n\nWhat is clear, however, is that if you do come across a clown in your neighbourhood, the chances of him (or her) being genuinely dangerous are next to zero. Youre most likely seeing someone pranking you, someone in the middle of some kind of performance art or a person simply making their way to a fancy dress party.','2017-03-25 03:51:15'),(703,92,'e9c0b0a4fd7bc2435773c971ae400cf2ecbb24ff8285715ed9ebc63b22e637a6','a109a0e321aa4d748c85e239c455a650','','','One of the penalties for refusing to participate in politics is that you end up being governed by your inferiors.

A former President of the same student organization is now pushing a bill to make Islamophobia illegal in Canada.\n\nIqra Khalid was born in Pakistan and moved to Canada in the 1990s. She is a Liberal Member of Parliament, a Muslim, and a former President of York Universitys MSA.\n\nInterestingly enough, despite noting her work as President of a Pakistani student club, her official Liberal Party website makes no mention of her work as President of the York University Muslim Students Association.\n\nWith this parliamentary motion, the Prime Minister and his minion, Khalid, hope to wipe this imaginary phobia out by silencing Canadians who have common sense and are concerned about Jihad, both violent and cultural as well as Sharia Law usurping Canadian Laws.\n\nIf Canadians are not able to speak out about the issues resulting from Islamic Law and jihad they will be put in grave danger. It will also bring danger to Americans as there are many places on the border where it is possible to simply walk across without a border crossing.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has the Islamic Global Jihad in his crosshairs and for good reason.

Trudeaus thwarting of Trumps plan bodes ill for their upcoming meeting & this creation of Canada into an Islamic State wont help either.\n\nCoincidentally, the day after Trudeau announced his desire to welcome the supposed rejected refugeesentering the US, a tragic shooting took place at a Mosque in Quebec where 6 Muslims were killed by a young Canadian man. At first it was reported that there were two suspects, a Muslim and a Canadian. The worshippers heard one of them scream, Allah Akbar. The Muslim suspect was held for 15 hours and then released as only a witness.\n\nThe story was then framed around the one young Canadian man who was built up to be an Islamophobic white supremacist, Trump supporter with flimsy evidence for this taken from his Facebook page. Trudeaus office interfered and demanded Fox News remove a tweet that named the Muslim suspect that Fox had reported from Canadian media and all other news outlets had also reported. It isnt clear if well ever get the full and true story on this.\n\nNot surprisingly, this incident has been used by the Prime Minister and the propaganda media arm of his party, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, to fuel the hysteria that all Canadians are Islamophobic and therefore a Law banning Islamophobia is absolutely necessary.\n\nTrudeaus short sighted desire to please his Islamic handlers could put Canadian trade, travel and our special relationship in jeopardy.

Sanders later married her sister Magda.\n\nGabor also married New York businessman Herbert Hutner, oilman Joshua Cosden, Barbie doll designer Jack Ryan, her divorce lawyer Michael O\'Hara, Count Felipe de Alba of Mexico and Frederic Prinz von Anhalt.\n\nHer marriage to de Alba was annulled because her divorce from O\'Hara was not final at the time of the wedding.\n\nHer 1986 marriage to von Anhalt, which lasted until her death, was by far her longest.\n\nGabor, who had a penchant for calling everyone \"dah-ling\" in her thick Hungarian accent, carved out a career in her early days in Hollywood, although her acting skills were rarely lauded.\n\nHer finest film roles came with Moulin Rouge, where she earned good reviews, in 1952 and Lili in 1953.\n\nShe appeared in more than 30 movies and, by the 1970s, she began to reject smaller roles, saying:\n\nGabor eventually ended up in low-budget films with such titles as Queen of Outer Space and Picture Mommy Dead.\n\nGreater success came with nightclub and TV appearances, where she said she called everyone \"dah-ling\" because she could not remember names well, and relied on self-parodying jokes based on her marriages, haughty demeanour and taste for opulence.\n\nShe often played herself in film and television roles.\n\nGabor was not seen in public in her final years, as she struggled with her health, including broken bones and cuts from a car accident.\n\nShe also suffered a stroke and a broken hip, enduring complications from hip replacement surgery.\n\nShe had much of her right leg amputated in 2011 because of an infection.\n\nGabor\'s most recent stint in hospital came just days after her 99th birthday in February 2016, for breathing difficulties.\n\nThroughout her Hollywood heyday, Gabor listed her birthday only as February 6, steadfastly refusing to reveal the year. A former spokesman, John Blanchette, said she was born in 1917.\n\nIn 1989, Gabor\'s temper landed her in jail for three days, after she slapped a policeman who had stopped her Rolls-Royce because of an expired license tag.

Most of her problems originated from that beautiful mouth.\n\n\"Zsa Zsa Gaborwill always be an American icon and the kliegin the Gabor-Hilton dynasty.\"\n\nGabor had been in ill health since being hospitalized after a fall in July 2010. She had hip replacement surgery afterwardbut returned to the hospital several times for treatment of swelling and clots. Most of her right leg had been amputatedbecause of gangrene.\n\nAlthough after her television career Gabor had become a punchline or a caricature, known for her run-in with a Beverly Hills cop or for her many marriages, it wasnt always that way. Gabor was of a time when socialite was not yet a term of derision.\n\nDespite a spotty film career, she became a staple on TV. She often appeared as herself and spoofed her active social life with a quip and a dahlink that became her signature term of endearment.\n\nShe was born Sari Gabor in Budapest, Hungary in 1917, the middle of three sisters. Magda and Eva also were actresses and socialites; Eva starred on TVs Green Acres. Eva Gabor died in 1995 and Magda in 1997.\n\nZsa Zsa competed in the 1936 Miss Hungary pageant but, her mothers biography she said, was disqualified for being underage.\n\nShe made her film debut in the musical Lovely to Look At (1952) opposite Red Skelton, Kathryn Grayson and Howard Keel.Fittingly for someone who became famous just for being herself, Gabors characters name was Zsa Zsa.\n\nThat same year, she also had a part in Were Not Married! with Ginger Rogers and Fred Allenand starred in Moulin Rouge with Jos Ferrer. Gabor later appeared opposite onetime husband George Sanders in Death of a Scoundrel (1956) and had a small role in Orson Welles Touch of Evil (1958). Memorably, she played Talleah in the B-movie Queen of Outer Space (1958).\n\nBeginning in the 1950s through the 1980s, Gabor was a frequent guest on television, in series as diverse as Playhouse 90 and the Colgate Comedy Hour to F Troop and Batman, as well as countless appearances on variety and talk shows.\n\nShe was glamorous, quick-witted and not afraid to make fun of herself or her nine marriages (including to Conrad Hilton, Paris Hiltons great-grandfather),seven divorces and one annulment. Sample joke: A man in love is incomplete until he has married  then hes finished. Or, touting her housekeeping abilities, she noted that despite her divorces, she manages to keep the house.\n\nGabor made headlines and jump-started her career in 1989 after an altercation with a police officer. She slapped the officer after being stopped for a driving violation and was arrested on charges of assault.\n\nShe was fined and sentenced to three days in jail after failing to complete the terms of her probation. A civil suit was settled out of court in 1991. The incident resulted in an unauthorized documentary, The People Vs. Zsa Zsa Gabor (1991). That same year, she memorably spoofed the incident in The Naked Gun 2: The Smell of Fear.\n\nIn later years, Gabor appeared as herself in such movies as The Beverly Hillbillies (1993) and A Very Brady Sequel (1996).\n\nBut legal troubles kept her name in the headlines. In June 2005, she and her husband, Prince Frederic von Anhalt, sued Gabors only child, Francesca Hilton, accusing her of larceny and fraud.\n\nDespite a tepid movie career, a tumultuous personal life and sometimes public legal wrangling, Gabor remained a celebrity for decades, a singular personality known by one name.

In 2011, her leg was amputated.\n\nGabor may have risen to fame as a performer, but she held on to it through simply being Zsa Zsa Gabor: glamorous socialite, witty talk-show guest and sister of Eva (\"Green Acres\") and Magda.\n\nShe was married nine times and divorced seven, with another union annulled. Her adventures filled gossip columns for decades. She made quips about her husbands and romances -- \"I\'m a great housekeeper -- every time I get a divorce, I keep the house\" -- was a favorite, and paraded through pop culture accompanied by jewels, tiny dogs and her ever-present, heavily accented \"Dahlink.\"\n\nIn her ability to maintain her celebrity status without ever appearing to work for it in the classic ways -- singing, acting, performing (though, it could be argued, she was ALWAYS performing) -- she was a predecessor to more recent boldface names such as Anna Nicole Smith, Paris Hilton and Kim Kardashian.\n\nLittle was ever said about Gabor\'s acting, though she appeared in some fine films, including John Huston\'s 1952 Toulouse-Lautrec biopic \"Moulin Rouge\" and Orson Welles\' 1958 noir classic, \"Touch of Evil.\" Instead, she was \"famous for being famous,\" as the saying goes.\n\nAt the height of her fame, her name was a synonym for jet-set living. She was a villain in TV\'s campy \"Batman\" and earned headlines for a variety of escapades, including not paying a hotel bill and feuding with Elke Sommer. Her lovers included playboy Porfirio Rubirosa and Dominican political heir -- and married father of six -- Ramfis Trujillo.\n\n\"She wants to be like Zsa Zsa Gabor,\" sang Dion of a high-living ex in 1963\'s \"Donna the Prima Donna,\" and everybody knew what he meant.\n\nBut Gabor was also capable of parodying her image, particularly after a 1989 incident in which she was accused of slapping a Beverly Hills police officer after a traffic stop. She appeared in \"The Naked Gun 2: The Smell of Fear,\" the film version of \"The Beverly Hillbillies\" and an episode of \"The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air\" as, essentially, herself, reveling in the notoriety of the slapping incident.\n\nSari Gabor -- \"Zsa Zsa\" was a nickname -- was born February 6, 1917, in Budapest, Hungary, then part of the Austro-Hungarian empire. She was the middle of the three Gabor sisters, with Magda the eldest.\n\nAccording to a famous story, Zsa Zsa entered the Miss Hungary beauty contest in 1936 but was disqualified for being underage. The family moved to the United States at the outbreak of World War II, and the sisters started establishing reputations as actresses while also keeping up appearances as socialites.\n\nIn 1942 -- already a divorcee -- Zsa Zsa married hotelier Conrad Hilton. The union, which lasted five years, produced the only Gabor heir, daughter Francesca Hilton (who was Paris Hilton\'s great-aunt).\n\nAmong Gabor\'s other relationships was a short-lived marriage to actor George Sanders -- who later married her sister Magda -- and marriages to a builder, an oilman and an inventor.\n\nAt her death, she was married to Frederic Prinz von Anhalt, whom she wed in 1986.','2017-03-25 03:51:15'),(709,93,'ec4268f0b0c534cef835f7421b8340dc9157de244c996401304358464001808a','64cb4718d51d4d5c95c408a0364bd884','','','At her peak, Gabor was one of the most famous women in the world. Known for her unapologetically lavish lifestyle and bombshell image, she was in the public eye for more than six decades. Though Gaborwithdrew from the limelight in her later years, she remained an enduring figure of old Hollywood glamour.\n\nThe daughter of a soldier and a European jewelry heiress,Sari Gabor was born on Feb. 6, 1917, (her birth year has been disputed throughout her career) in Budapest, Hungary. Gabor, who began referring to herself as Zsa Zsa in childhood, was discovered by the famous opera singer Richard Tauber in 1934, setting her on a path toward superstardom.\n\nAlthough Gabor made her mark on the silver screen with roles in Lovely to Look At (1952), Moulin Rouge (1952), Death of a Scoundrel (1956), Queen of Outer Space (1958) and Orson Welles Touch of Evil (1958),her foremost claim to fame was her tumultuous romances with some of the biggest Hollywood stars of the day, earning her the dubious title ofthe most successful courtesan of the 20th century.\n\nHer nine husbands  Gabor claims she only had eight  include a Turkish diplomat, hotel magnate Conrad Hilton, with whom she had one child, Francesca Hilton, and actor George Sanders. Her rumored affairs with the likes of Sean Connery, JFK and Richard Burton inspired tabloid fodder that even Kim Kardashian would envy.\n\nEvery girl should be married at least once in her life. Its a must, Gabor wrote in the 1970 book How to Catch a Man, How to Keep a Man, How to Get Rid of a Man.Because once you have been married, you are a Mrs., and even if the marriage doesnt work out, they cant take that away from you.\n\nIn addition to her luminous screen presence and storied romances, the Hungarian sweetheart won favor for her quick witted Yogi Berra-like quotes about love and marriage such as, I am a marvelous housekeeper. Every time I leave a man, I keep his house, or I want a man whos kind and understanding. Is that too much to ask of a millionaire?\n\nPerhaps the perfect incident to describe Gabors peculiar temperament was her arrest in 1989. The former beauty queen slapped a Beverly Hills police officerwho dared to pull her over for driving her white Rolls-Royce Corniche without a valid license. She spent three days in jail and the case was settled out of court two years later.\n\nIn 1986, she married her last husband, Prince Frederic von Anhalt, the adopted son of German royalty and roughly 30 years her junior. Through marriage, Gabor assumed the title Princess von Anhalt, Duchess of Saxony, finally becoming the princess she always wanted to be.\n\nIn 2002, Gabor was badly injured in a car crash that made her a wheelchair user for the remainder of her life, leading to a serious decline in her health. She also suffered a stroke three years later.In January 2011, doctors were forced to amputate her right leg due to an untreated blood clot infection, leaving her bedridden and under the complete care of von Anhalt.\n\nGabor was hospitalized again in February 2016 after having trouble breathing due to a feeding-tube-related lung infection. With the help of von Anhalt, she returned home to prepare for the surgery to replace the tube in March. Despite her declining health, von Anhalt believed she would still make it to 100 years old.\n\nThroughout her life, Gabor had a difficult relationship with her own daughter, who died in January 2015 of a stroke at the age of 67. Five years before her death, von Anhalt sued Francesca on behalf of himself and Zsa Zsa, accusing her of fraud and forgery. The lawsuit was later dropped after Gabor refused to appear in court or sign an affidavit attesting to her desire to sue her only daughter. Before her death, Francesca reportedly said,My mother wanted to be a princess, so she married an evil queen.\n\nZsa Zsa Gabor ushered in the new age of celebrity, where ones personal life could be as compelling as a performance on screen. Although her later years were plagued by health problems and tragedy  after close friend Elizabeth Taylor died she reportedly said, Im next  she did everything in her power to preserve the image of the beautiful and carefree Hungarian princess she worked so hard to create.','2017-03-25 03:51:15'),(710,93,'ec4268f0b0c534cef835f7421b8340dc9157de244c996401304358464001808a','8b9d76b908004837b71ba0d6d3315888','','','Zsa Zsa Gabor, the jet-setting Hungarian actress who made a career out of multiple marriages, conspicuous wealth and jaded wisdom about the glamorous life, has died. She was 99.The middle and most famous of the sisters Gabor died Sunday of a heart attack at her Los Angeles home, husband Frederic von Anhalt told The Associated Press.\"We tried everything, but her heart just stopped and that was it,\" he said. \"Even the ambulance tried very hard to get her back, but there was no way.\"Gabor had been hospitalized repeatedly since she broke her right hip in July 2010 after a fall at her Bel-Air home. She already had to use a wheelchair after being partly paralyzed in a 2002 car accident and suffering a stroke in 2005. Most of her right leg was amputated in January 2011 because of gangrene and the left leg was also threatened. Von Anhalt duly reported her misfortunes to the media.The great aunt of Paris Hilton and a spiritual matriarch to the Kardashians and other tabloid favorites, she was the original hall-of-mirrors celebrity, famous for being famous for being famous. Starting in the 1940s, Gabor rose from beauty queen to millionaire\'s wife to minor television personality to minor film actress to major public character. With no special talent, no hit TV series such as her sister Eva\'s \"Green Acres,\" Zsa Zsa nevertheless was a long-running hit just being Zsa Zsa - her accent drenched in diamonds, her name synonymous with frivolity and camp as she winked and carried on about men, dahling, and the droll burdens of the idle rich.She was like popcorn for the public and, for sociologists, the seeming fulfillment of the mindless future imagined in Aldous Huxley\'s \"Brave New World,\" a creation made possible by mass, electronic media; her words and image transcribed and beamed into theaters and living rooms, on the internet and the shelves of newsstands and supermarket checkout lines.Her secret, in part, was being in on the joke, once saying about a 1956 TV role, \"I play a fabulously rich woman who has just bought her fifth husband; she is very unhappy. I won\'t tell you who it\'s supposed to be.\" Ever game for a laugh, Gabor spoofed her image in a videotaped segment on David Letterman\'s \"Late Show,\" which had the two stars driving from one fast-food restaurant to another, sipping sodas and digging into burgers like they were slabs of wedding cake.Amid all the trivia, she had a peripheral part in two big scandals of the early 21st century: the death of Anna Nicole Smith (von Anhalt claimed to have had an affair with her) and the alleged financial scam of Bernard Madoff (a lawyer said she might have lost $10 million through him). And she was in the spotlight for a dustup from the late 20th century: \"The slap heard \'round the world.\"In June 1989, Gabor smacked Paul Kramer, a police officer, on a Beverly Hills street, after he pulled over her Rolls-Royce Corniche convertible for a traffic violation. She was convicted of misdemeanor battery on a police officer, driving without a driver\'s license and having an open container of alcohol in the car. She served three days in jail, performed community service at a woman\'s shelter and paid $13,000 in fines and restitution.When she was freed, she told reporters the jailers were kind but \"at first I was petrified. They even took my makeup away.\"Gabor kept up the act in the advice book \"How to Catch a Man, How to Keep a Man, How to Get Rid of a Man,\" and in the exercise video, \"It\'s Simple Darling,\" in which she banters and stretches with a pair of muscular young trainers. Her memoir, \"One Life Is Not Enough,\" came out in 1991 and dished about everything from her virginity (gone at 15) to the endless men who came on to her (She would claim that William Paley of CBS promised Gabor her own show if only she would spend an afternoon with him.)Gabor had one child, Francesca Hilton, from her marriage to hotelier Conrad Hilton. (She would allege the child was conceived after Hilton raped her.) In later years, Gabor, von Anhalt and Francesca battled in court over family finances. Francesca Hilton died of an apparent stroke in 2015.Sari Gabor - Zsa Zsa is a family nickname - was born in Budapest in 1917, according to a finishing school yearbook kept by a former classmate. Various references over the years have given other birth dates; Gabor usually avoided the subject. She was still in Hungary when she won a beauty contest and married and divorced a Turkish diplomat, Turhan Belge.Gabor, sisters Eva and Magda, and their mother, Jolie, emigrated to America around World War II. Zsa Zsa gained notice when she became the wife of Conrad Hilton, whom she married in 1942 and by the following decade all the Gabors were celebrities. (Eva died in 1995 at age 74. Mother Jolie died in April 1997 at age 97 and sister Magda died two months later at age 78).In 1998, cultural historian Neal Gabler diagnosed her kind of celebrity as \"The Zsa Zsa Factor.\"\"When she first came to fame in the early 1950s, Zsa Zsa wasn\'t an actress or a singer or a dancer or an entertainer of any sort,\" he observed. \"She was the beautiful wife of actor George Sanders who happened to appear on a quiz show dispensing offhanded advice to lovelorn viewers. By being herself she became such a success that she immediately landed movie roles.\"Her film career was, as The Film Encyclopedia notes, \"mostly decorative.\" Among Gabor\'s more prominent credits: as dancer Jane Avril in John Huston\'s Toulouse-Lautrec biopic, \"Moulin Rouge,\" 1952; and Orson Welles\' classic \"Touch of Evil,\" 1958. More recently, she appeared in the \"Nightmare on Elm Street\" series and in the \"Naked Gun\" spoofs.Her love life, meanwhile, rolled on, like a B-melodrama on a double-bill with Elizabeth Taylor\'s A-list spectacular.In 1954, Gabor made headlines being seen with Dominican Republic playboy-diplomat Porfirio Rubirosa within weeks of his marriage to dime store heiress Barbara Hutton. Her 1958 romance with Rafael Trujillo Jr., son of the Dominican dictator, became a scandal in Congress. Ohio\'s Rep. Wayne Hayes - eventually caught in his own adulterous affair - cited the expensive gifts Gabor was allegedly receiving from the young man to argue that foreign aid for the island nation should be eliminated.She wed eight times - nine including a 1982 shipboard ceremony that was quickly annulled and may not have been legal. Other husbands included businessman Herbert L. Hutner and prolific inventor Jack Ryan, credited with designing everything from missiles to the Barbie doll. She is survived by von Anhalt, whom she married in 1986.Part of Mama Jolie\'s advice to her daughters, as recounted in a 1953 Associated Press interview with Zsa Zsa, has a modern touch. She said she told them: \"You must be independent and able to do for yourself. Then you do not have to marry a rich man, you can marry a poor one.

Some recipes contain cashew milk and hemp seeds (for protein), while others fuse ingredients like beets, chlorophyll, and dark leafy greens. They taste ... well, it depends on who you ask. Testimonials range from delicious to incredibly delicious to war on everything delicious to like kissing a cow to like drinking everything bad that ever happened to me in high school. But the payoff is supposedly great. Juice, say the websites, and your hair will shine, your skin will shimmer with vitality, youll have tons of energy and a clear mind, your immune and digestive systems will recover and approach an indestructibility heretofore associated with Norse gods. Those are some of the humbler claims: The BluePrint program, which charges $75 per day, also mentions that clients who have more serious cases or are using [BluePrint Cleanse] in cancer therapy have continued on a cleanse indefinitely,until they are healed.\n\nOne thing that actually will happen to most juicers, though of course it is not their motivation, is that they will lose weight. At around 1,000 calories a day, the cleansesresemble religious fastspurifying rituals undertaken during Ramadan or Yom Kippur, or by medieval Christian mystics. (In theNew Republic, Judith Shulevitz traces the history of holy figures starving their bodies to nourish their soulsthough they didnt call it detox at that time.) Juicing also has a lot in common with more terrestrial crazes like thecabbage soup diet and going Paleo. Be virtuous! Purge your body! Look hot in jeans! (For only $525 a week!) Somehow, with JC, all of these directives miraculously become one.\n\nSomeone should design a comedy routine in which nutritionists are lined up and asked to complete the sentence: Juice cleanses are ... The responses I got included nonsense, unsustainable, bone-headed, and not the answerand I think my interlocutors were trying to be polite. We need protein and fat in our diets. We also need to consume enough calories to reassure our bodies we arent starving, or we risk all kinds of metabolic and electrical freak-outs. Plus, liquefying fruits and vegetables means getting rid of fiber, which aids digestion by sustaining the microflora in our gut. (LOL! Lets obsess over how immaculate we can make our insides even though our intestines host trillions of bacteria.)\n\nYet the real JC sales pitch is not about microflora or nutrients or evenostensiblyweight loss. Its about toxins. You cleanse to flush your system of impurities, flecks of blight (some would say sin) lodged in your cells. We live in an age of what William James called medical materialism, so instead of fretting about a fallen world, we speak of a poisoned one, observes Shulevitz in her New Republic article. BluePrint and Life Juice are meant to scrub away the effects of our pizza Mondays, our martini weekends, our polluted air and water. Get right with your gut, the cleanse companies urge. Get right with God.\n\nObviously, cleansing acolytes use the word toxin loosely, as a metaphor for our lapsed lifestyles. Toxins are like cholesterol clogging an artery, except they block the path to woo-woo transcendence instead of the left atrium. Or, as Vanessa Grigoriadis puts it in New York magazine, Food is the focus of an enormous amount of modern moralism ... One wants to be skinny because one wants to be healthy; one wants to be healthy because one wants to be good. As religion declines among elite urbanites, a new scripturesprouting and enzymes and whatnotis swirling into the void.\n\nBut the cleanse mentality is more than just judgmental and irritating: Its dangerous. Making each meal a drama of discipline, deprivation, and control? Floating along on a superior high that isnt really about how much weight youre losing (but actually kind of is about how much weight youre losing)? Seeking to express your achievements, be they moral, social, or financial, in the most visible terms you can manage? Does anyone else think this sounds a lot like an eating disorder?\n\nThere are certainly commonalities if we consider who is likely to develop an eating disorder and who is likely to undergo a cleanse, says Linda Antinoro, a nutrition specialist at Brigham and Womens Hospital in Boston. The diets seem compulsive and perhaps addictive. The restrictive tone is the same. While Antinoro notes that few people can sustain that level of deprivation for long periods of time, which would be necessary for full-blown anorexia, she worries about juicers getting hooked on the immediate gratification of weight loss. Suddenly you can fit into your tiny dress.\n\nAre cleanses a socially sanctioned way to test drive pre-anorexic or bulimic behaviors? While refusing food for 3, 5, or 7 days at a stretch would raise eyebrows in most workplaces, writes Jenna Sauers of Jezebel, saying youre on a cleanse gives you a pass. (Not to mention that for women already enthralled to an eating disorder, juicing offers a great cover.) Even the JC websites seem confused about their purpose: Is it to find Zen or to get really skinny? This is not a diet, insists BluePrint about its most abstemious cleanse. However, we know what youre going to ask next. So yes, this is the Cleanse level that contains the least amount of EVERYTHING. In other words, while one does not cleanse to drop pounds, if one wanted to choose a program based on calories and to pursue dramatic weight loss accordingly ... well, you get the picture.\n\nAnyway, I wasnt surprised to read that Dr. Pauline Powers, who directs the scientific advisory committee for the Global Foundation for Eating Disorders, considers cleanses the perfect pathway to disordered eating. Like traditional eating disorder symptoms, cleansing has an almost magical power to structure our chaos. As Slates June Thomas noted on a recent DoubleX Gabfest, the liberation of cleansing comes from feeling disciplined, in control, and ... able to resist temptation. Or, as Grigoriadis put it in New York: With juice, you can wash everything away, all the things that make you feel helpless ... You are above it all. You spent the money on the juice ... and you will be a success. Theres no reason to be anxious, because you have everything under control.\n\nThe psychology of specialness Grigoriadis describesa lightheaded superiority to mortalsis a huge part of what makes some eating disorders so hard to shake, because it becomes part of your identity. For proof, look no further than the recent commentary about Kelsey Osgoods anorexia memoir, How to Disappear Completely. In a review for The Cut, Molly Fischer laments the perverse glamor suffusing our eating disorder narrativesthe idea, as one columnist put it, that there is no such thing as a ... creature whose radical self-regulation comes unaccompanied by an impressive imagination or intelligence. Osgood herself writes in Time of anorexias seductions: I wanted to catch it. And she highlights the problem with making possibly disordered habits (like JCs) seem super trendy. Though we dont know yet the full biological mechanisms behind starvation, we do know that underfeeding in any human can lead to anorexic thought patterns and behaviors, which in turn can become their ownaddiction.\n\nThis is not to say that everyone who cleanses has, or will soon have, an eating disorder. Nor am I suggesting that all juicers are being disingenuous about their interest in health. But both cleansers and people who struggle with disordered eating show a tendency toward enfolding their dietary choices in myths and religiosity, poetry and rapture. The author Francine du Plessix Gray discovered mental clarity and spiritual worth in anorexia. A quarter of a century later, Juice Press owner Marcus Antebi achieves remarkable physical, emotional, and spiritual status by sucking down six atomized salads a day. Maybe weve always sought the holy in our daily rituals, whether those small routines are good for us or not. But if juice cleanses make us feel so special, its worth asking why that isand whether any of our woozy, kale-fueled enlightenment comes at a price.\n\nWell, duh it comes at a price, you are saying. An astronomical, absurd, $10 per bottle price, not counting all the herbal tea you have to buy to cut the hunger pangs and the $125 colonic. And thats the final piece of odiousness in juice cleansesthat their purity and excellence is inevitably tied to wealth. Unlike timeless forms of salvation, salvation by vegetable goop is only available to the well-heeled. (In this way, it resembles salvation by Soul Cycle or salvation by marked-up yoga gear.) So while the apotheosis of juice may speak to a new wave of health consciousness, trendy spirituality, and eco-activism, it also, as Noreen Malone suggests in the New Republic, owes a debt to American Puritanismthe fusion of virtue with a sharply competitive spirit. Virtue, in this case a Pilates-toned body or a pricey green drink, is something to flaunt. Want to really show your neighbors whos No. 1?

There are no credible news or health authority reports that support the claim that Evolution juice products have been contaminated or that any people have died from consuming the juice. The message is just a pointless hoax.\n\nEvolution Fresh Juice is owned and distributed by giant US coffee store chain Starbucks and issold in large quantities at Starbucks stores and selected retailers across the United States and Canada. If the product really did contain poison, then, of course, there would be official product recalls as well as widely-publicized warnings to consumers. However, there are no recalls for Evolution juice productslisted on the US government recall website or any other official publication. Nor are there any official consumer warnings about the juice.\n\nMoreover, I could find no evidence to suggest that Starbucks Evolution Fresh Juice products are currently being distributed in the African countries listed in the message.\n\nThe image of the Evolution Fresh juice products used in the hoax message has been lifted directly from the Starbucks website. And, apparently in an effort to give the false warning more impact, the hoax perpetrator has added in twocompletely unrelated images showing dead  or perhaps just unconscious  human bodies.\n\nIn fact, this would-be warning appears to be just the latest in a long line of similar product contamination hoaxes that have circulated in various forms for several years. Sharing these false warnings serves only to spread misinformation and cause unnecessary fear and alarm in communities.\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nExample:\n\n Please send this to your friends and family immediately because these drink or swear of fruit are already in Nigeria, Benin, Togo and Ghana.

When one of his classmates, Charlie Dillon (played by Damon), cheats on a test, the anti-Semitic students blame David Greene (played by Fraser). Greene and another classmatethe deliciously named Rip Van Kelt (played by a Randal Batinkoff, who somehow managed not to go on to great stardom)saw Dillon cheat, but didnt report it.\n\nIn the end, Dillon is expelled after Van Kelt comes forward to expose him. Dillon was definitely wrong, but Greene and the other student also broke the schools honor code by not reporting.\n\nNot wanting to rat on your classmate is nothing compared to Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton and her staff failing todisclose that they received debate questions in advance from then-CNN contributor Donna Brazile.\n\nThis all startedas far as we know so farback in March 2016, when Brazile sent the Clinton campaign a copy of a question that would be presented to her at an upcoming debate.\n\nThe email subject read: From time to time I get the questions in advance. The body of the email from Brazile read: Heres one that worries me about [Hillary Rodham Clinton]. Included in the email was a question about the death penalty. An extremely similarly worded question was asked at the debate.\n\nWe only know about this email because of the illegally obtained documents released by Wikileaks. In the wake of this disclosure, Brazile (now also the Interim Democratic Party Chairwoman after Debbie Wasserman Schultz stepped down for seemingly rigging the primary in favor of Clinton) went on Fox News and adamantly claimed the emails released by Wikileaks were doctored.\n\nI have seen so many doctored emails. I have seen things that come from me at 2 in the morning that I dont even send, she told Foxs Megyn Kelly. There are several email addresses that I once used.\n\nShe added that the emails had not been verified and that, as a Christian woman, she understood persecution.\n\nAnd we thought life went on. But on Monday, Wikileaks released another email from Brazile to the Clinton camp, this one was sent a week before the one I mentioned earlier about the death penalty.\n\nBrazile sent an email to the Clinton campaign with the subject: One of the questions directed to HRC tomorrow is from a woman with a rash.\n\nIm sure the woman who asked the question is thrilled atbeing described that way.\n\nBrazile followed up that subject by writing: Her family has lead poison and she will ask what, if anything, will Hillary do as president to help the [people] of Flint [Michigan].\n\nShe added: Folks, I did a service project today. Its so tragic. And whats worse, some homes have not been tested and its important to encourage seniors to also get tested.\n\nThe release of this second email prompted CNN to announce that it had actually severed ties with Brazile back on Oct. 14 when the first email was released, saying the network was completely uncomfortable with what Brazile did.\n\nBut what about Clinton? Did her staff prep her about the Flint water crisis and the death penalty without telling her a question was coming? Perhaps, and maybe Clinton wasnt suspicious about the seeming randomness of the death penalty question. But even if Clinton herself didnt know, some of her top staffers clearly did and prepared her for the questions.\n\nWhile people are calling for CNN to investigate how Brazile got the questions in the first place, Im not seeing a lot of people condemning Team Clinton for failing to disclose that they received the questions in advance.\n\nAlso, did this only happen in the primary? Or did Clinton receive questions in advance of her debate with GOP nominee Donald Trump? Hes already on the trail talking about a rigged election, and this would certainly feed into that narrative.\n\nI really think its time to start asking the Clinton campaign some questions about these debate questions.

Walters asked.\n\nClinton responded with a lengthy answer that moderator Anderson Cooper had to twice interrupt in an attempt to keep to the agreed-upon time limit. Clintons remarks drew applause from the crowd, though she wound up ultimately losing the states primary to Sanders two days later.\n\nThe apparent email tip-off was included in the latest trove of messages hacked from Clinton Campaign Chairman John Podestas Gmail account and posted by WikiLeaks.\n\nBrazile had been under fire over an earlier email chain appearing to show her tipping off the campaign before a town hall event later that same month. That exchange began with Brazile sending Palmieri the text of a question about the death penalty in an email with the subject line: From time to time I get the questions in advance.\n\nRoland Martin asked the death penalty question verbatim the next night during a CNN town hall.\n\nBrazile\'s role as a CNN contributor was suspended when she took over as interim DNC head in July, but on Oct. 14, in light of the email revelations, CNN said it accepted her full resignation.\n\n\"We are completely uncomfortable with what we have learned about her interactions with the Clinton campaign while she was a CNN contributor,\" the network said Monday in a statement.\n\nBrazile on Monday tweeted a \"thank you\" to CNN and in a second tweet told the media to refer to an Oct. 11 statement she gave to Politico about the controversy.\n\nAs a longtime political activist with deep ties to our party, I supported all of our candidates for president,\" Brazile\'s statement said. \"I often shared my thoughts with each and every campaign, and any suggestions that indicate otherwise are simply untrue.

That rumor appears to be false.\n\nHowever,leaked emails have since confirmed that the Clintons campaign received questions in advance of two town hall events held during the Democratic primaries in March. CNN contributor and DNC Chairwoman Donna Brazile supplied the questions to Clintons campaign, Politico reports\n\nIn the first instance, ahead of a March 13 CNNtown hall, it appears that guest-moderatorRoland Martin from TV One may have sharedhis contributions to the questions with Brazile.In an email the day before the town hall tosenior Clinton staffers, Brazile wrote: Fromtime to time I get the questions in advanceand included the text of a question about thedeath penalty. An email later obtained byPOLITICO showed that the text of the questionBrazile sent to the Clinton campaign wasidentical to a proposed question Martin hadoffered CNN. (A similar, though not identicalquestion, was ultimately posed to Clinton atthe town hall).\n\nBrazile also tipped off the Clinton campaign that a woman with a rash would be asking a question during the town hall held in Flint, Michigan, with Bernie Sanders:\n\nIn the newest email, sent one day before theMarch 6 Democratic primary debate in Flint,Michigan,Brazile tells senior campaign staffthat One of the questions directed to HRCtomorrow is from a woman with a rash. Herfamily has lead poison and she will ask what, ifanything, will Hillary do as president to helpthe ppl of Flint.\n\nCNN cut ties with Brazile on October 14th in response to the leakedemails, and the network stated that it was completely uncomfortable with what had occurred.\n\nSo, while its true that Clinton received questions in advance of two town hall appearances with Democratic rival Bernie Sanders in March  theres no proof that she received questions in advance for the three presidential debates with Donald Trump.\n\nThe Baltimore Gazettefake news site published the report immediately following the firstbetween Clinton and Donald Trump on September 27th. The story, which appeared under the headline, Clinton Received Debate Questions Week Before Debate, According to Sources, reports:\n\nEarlier last week an NBC intern was seen hand delivering a package to Clintons campaign headquarters, according to sources. The package was not given to secretarial staff, as would normally happen, but the intern was instead ushered into the personal office of Clinton campaign manager Robert Mook. Members of the Clinton press corps from several media organizations were in attendance at the time, and a reporter from Fox News recognized the intern, but said he was initially confused because the NBC intern was dressed like a Fed Ex employee.\n\nThe reporter from Fox questioned campaign staff about the intern, but campaign staff at first claimed ignorance and then claimed that it was just a Fed Ex employee who had already left. No reporters present who had seen the intern dressed as a Fed Ex employee go into Mooks office saw him leave by the same front entrance. The Fox reporter who recognized the intern also immediately looked outside of the campaign headquarters and noted that there were no Fed Ex vehicles parked outside.\n\nClinton seemed to have scripted responses ready for every question she was asked at the first debate. She had facts and numbers memorized for specific questions that it is very doubtful she would have had without being furnished the questions beforehand. The entire mainstream media has specifically been trying to portray Trump as a racist and a poor candidate. By furnishing Clinton with the debate questions NBC certainly hoped to make Clinton appear much more knowledgeable and competent than Trump. And though it is unlikely that anyone will be able to conclusively prove that Clinton was given the debate questions, it seems both logical and likely.\n\nBaltimore Gazette states in its About Us section that its Baltimores oldest news source and one of the longest running daily newspapers published in the United States  but that description is intentionally misleading.\n\nIn reality, the Baltimore Gazette had a 10-year from 1865-1875, records kept by the Library of Congress indicate. Someone recently revived the Gazette and has been publishing a mixture of real and fake local and national news stories that has left many readers confused.\n\nOne example is a story about a man that stole Sudafed from a Walgreens on East Fayette Street in Baltimore  a story that sounds real enough, but isnt. The story includes a description of the suspect and a phonenumber for readers to call with tips. However, Baltimores City Paper learned from police that that theft never occurred:\n\nBPD spokesman T.J. Smith says the story doesnt appear to be true and notes that the phone number listed for anyone with information to contact is not affiliated with the department.\n\nIts not clear whos operating the site, but its safe to assume that its not a reliable source of news.

Whether he is talking about CNN, MSNBC, or anyone else, the assertion is applicable for everyone trying to unfairly help Hillary win this election.\n\nLast night, the moderator, Lester Holt, proved to millions of voters that he helped rig the election in favor of Hillary Clinton. That is not a wild claim or theory, we have statistics and analysis to prove how unfairly he treated Donald Trump. We also have another major development, too.\n\nSources are now reporting that Hillary Clinton was given the debate questions a week in advance.\n\nReports are arguing that an NBC Intern was seen delivering a package to Clintons campaign headquarters in New York. Given Hillarys troubles with emails, it makes perfect sense that they would deliver their information by hand to avoid hacking or getting caught.\n\nIt is being reported that the Intern walked into the headquarters, and went directly into the personal office of Clinton campaign manager Robert Mook. The Intern was spotted wearing a FedEx outfit, but a reporter working with Fox News recognized her and immediately reported what he saw.\n\nWhen the Fox News reporter raised questions, Clintons staff called him ignorant and ushered him out of the office and away from their building. The Fox News reporter argues that he stuck around and did not see a FedEx truck anywhere in sight the entire time.\n\nThis story appears to be true given how calmly she acted last night. It was almost as if she had a week to prepare for the questions, and that is why she sounded so robotic with all of her answers.\n\nHillary had the facts and numbers memorized for very specific questions, and that raises another red flag. Of course the mainstream media will brush this story off, just like they have about Hillarys emails, her server, Benghazi, and how the DNC rigged the primaries in favor of Clinton, but we can see the truth.\n\nWhile Hillary was fed the questions, she also got help from Lester Holt, the impartial moderator, that more than likely leaked the questions to her in the first place.\n\nHoltinterrupted Trump a record 41 times, either to fact-check him or to ask a follow-up question. Conversely, Clinton was only interrupted 7 times during the course of the 90-minutedebate.\n\nAdditionally, Holt interrupted Trump the most during a particularly heated exchange about Trumps stance on the Iraq War. Moderators are to remain impartial and unbiased, yet Holt made it his mission to argue Trump was lying when he claimed he was against the Iraq War.\n\nHolt interrupted Trump 10 times during the exchange, and demanded at least 5 times why Trump thought that he had better judgment than Clinton. How is that fair or impartial?\n\nWhy is it that Hillary can never do anything in accordance with the rules? Whether it is a presidential debate, her emails, server, or anything else, she is always lying or cheating. The American people continue to see how the mainstream media promotes Clinton every chance they get, and last night was another clear example of that.\n\nNot only is it possible that they gave Hillary the debate questions a week early, Holt deliberately attacked Trump disproportionately. The facts do not lie, and they all ganged up on Trump to promote Clinton.\n\nWe need to share this story so that answers are given. The media cannot be allowed to get away with journalistic malpractice any longer. Donald Trump is going to win this election, but we still need to expose the media for their lies and corruption.\n\nIf the media are siding with Hillary Clinton, then We The People must side with Donald Trump and help him win this election.

She added that if I had to do it all over again, I would know a hell of a lot more about cybersecurity.\n\nIn other words, Brazile would have made sure that her improper disclosures which prompted CNN to drop heras an analyst would not show up in hacked emails published by WikiLeaks.

In the body of the email, she adds: Her family has lead poison and she will ask what, if anything, will Hillary do as president to help the ppl of Flint.\n\nThe description matches Flint resident Lee-Anne Walters, a debate questioner who had previously talked about her family\'s rashes and showed her ownto a photographer.\n\nHer question was different, though. She asked if Clinton would \"make it a requirement that all public water systems must remove all lead service lines throughout the entire United States.\"\n\nIn another new email to Palmieri, on March 12 -- the day before a CNN town hall -- Brazile promises to send a few more,\"apparently referring to questions or subjects that would be covered.\n\nThe latter comment camein a newly released reply to a previously released email that Brazile had sent with the subject line, From time to time I get the questions in advance. In that email, Brazile seemed to warn of a death penalty question that could be forthcoming:\n\nHere\'s one that worries me about HRC. 19 states and the District of Columbia have banned the death penalty. 31 states, including Ohio, still have the death penalty. According to the National Coalition to Abolish the Death Penalty, since 1973, 156 people have been on death row and later set free. Since 1976, 1,414 people have been executed in the U.S. Thats 11% of Americans who were sentenced to die, but later exonerated and freed. Should Ohio and the 30 other states join the current list and abolish the death penalty?\n\nThis last email has been the basis for Trump\'s claims that Clinton was given debate questions in advance. But it wasn\'t entirely clear that Brazile was referring to the town hall.Clinton did get a question at the town hall about the death penalty, but again, it didn\'t look much like the description Brazile had provided. It was actually from a former death-row inmate who simply asked for Clinton\'s position on the issue.\n\nBrazile declined to comment further to The Washington Post.\n\nThere\'s no way I can engage in this cyberwar without placing the content in context. John\'s emails were hacked from a cyber intrusion, Brazile said. She referred to her statement from Oct. 11: As it pertains to the CNN debates, I never had access to questions and would never have shared them with the candidates if I did.\n\nTrump has taken thesingle example above and used it to argue repeatedly that Clinton was given debate questions beforehand and that the system was rigged in her favor in the Democratic primary campaign. He has also argued that, if he were the one who had received such information in advance, it would be a much bigger deal.\n\nNow that we have a fullerpicture that suggests the original Brazile email about the death penalty question wasn\'t an aberration, it\'s probably time to recognize that Clinton appeared to benefit from prior knowledge in at least two  and possibly more  instances, at least one of them a debate.\n\nIt\'s worth noting that the previews Clinton got didn\'t directly match the questions, so she didn\'t get hugely valuable information, but there wasat least an effort.\n\nAs usual, Trump went further than the evidence on hand supported;this time, his underlying premise hadsome merit.\n\nThis post has been updated with more details on Lee-Anne Walters.','2017-03-25 03:51:15'),(737,96,'f93fd25f63a1541c15eae4e36b31ca668b612a2c50c04dd07e8d0092c85f6eb7','1e88df6998b74585b3712fee3e60e247','','','Hillary Clinton received her questions for the first presidential debate of 2016 a week in advance.\n\nOn 26 September 2016, Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton and Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump squared off at Hofstra University for the first head-to-head presidential debate of the campaign.

I love Winston Churchill, love the guy.\'\n\nIn an apparent acknowledgement that he had been slow to speak out on the issue, the President concluded: \'That\'s just on Winston Churchill - I think people should know that, know my thinking on that.\'\n\nDuring Mr Bush\'s time in office, the White House was home to two busts of Churchill, both by British sculptor Jacob Epstein, with one in the Oval Office and another in the private quarters.\n\nAfter it emerged that Mr Obama had sent the Oval Office sculpture, which was originally a loan from Tony Blair, back to Britain some saw it as a sign he was not committed to the US-UK alliance.\n\nWhite House officials denied that the bust had been removed at all, but later admitted that they been confused by the fact that there were originally two of the sculptures.\n\nRivals of Mr Obama such as presidential candidate Ted Cruz have sought to make political capital out of the incident.\n\nMr Cruz said this year: \'One of the very first acts President Obama did upon being elected was sending Churchills bust back to the UK, and I think that foreshadowed everything that was to come the next six years.\'\n\nAnd in 2012, Mitt Romney promised to restore Churchill to the Oval Office if he was elected President.\n\nMr Obama\'s statement today came during the first full day of his visit to Britain, which will be the last before he leaves office next year.\n\nHe has courted controversy by vigorously opposing \'Brexit\', and also devoted some of the Press conference to paying an emotional tribute to the Queen after having lunch with her at Windsor Castle.','2017-03-25 03:51:15'),(748,98,'fa7a4633274f7f12398dc5f515980c04534ca9dbbb91f38196d8c859ba8a52e2','235a58d9bb024116b3adf9d3fbb1e406','','','A giant squid photo appearing on a satirical news site quickly went viral but was soon proven to be little more than a hoax. The image of a 160-foot squid washing ashore in California appeared on The Lightly Braised Turnip but went viral as it shared on social media.\n\nAs reported by National Geographic and Orlando Sentinel, the giant squid photo is a complete fake. A quick look at the origin of the photo, from the Lightly Braised Turnip, would have most people questioning the validity of the image. A Twitpic user, Fabeilo, found the original source of the image, depicting a crowd looking at a whale that washed ashore.\n\nThe site, much like the Daily Currant, appears to be a regular news site but quickly turns farcical. Recent headlines include Exclusive Interview with Santa Claus on Diverse Santas and several articles covering giant radioactive sea monsters, including a giant squid, giant oarfish and a Giant Fukushima Squid Found in Central Cali.\n\nThe headline attached to the giant squid photo reads Second Giant Sea Creature Washes Ashore Along Santa Monica Coastline  Alarms Sound Over Radioactive Gigantism. The article continues its Fukushima narrative by stating this sea creature was a byproduct of radioactive gigantism. The local radioactive gigantism expert quoted in the article does not exist nor does the listed institution, Santa Marino College. Another individual, Bruce Kenner, is listed as a marine biologist but is a fictional creation.\n\nReddit was also quick to discredit the article, listing several issues with the reporting of a giant squid washing ashore in Santa Monica, Calif. As Reddit and National Geographic point, these tales of radioactive gigantism seem inspired by the origins of Godzilla. Snopes also confirmed the giant squid photo was a hoax.\n\nAn analysis from Sherry Brukbacher, a news photo editor at National Geographic, states that all the shadows are wrong in the photo, a sure sign of a fake. Brukbacher points to the shadow underneath the giant squid as a sign of forgery as a sea creature washing ashore would lie flush on the beach. National Geographic says the largest giant squid on record measured 43 feet in length, citing the Smithsonian\'s National Museum of Natural History.\n\nMost photos that go viral tend to be shared with little context. Twitter accounts that tweet out incredible photos tend to do so without much attribution or a user sends out a photo with incorrect information that gets picked up and spreads across the Internet.\n\nIn the case of sea serpents, there were two cases in 2013 of giant creatures washing ashore in California. The creatures measured 14-feet and 18-feet in length but their size was not due to radioactive gigantism. The creatures that washed ashore were Oarfish, deep-sea fish that are rarely seen and grow to 50 feet in length.\n\nWhile not quite on the level of a giant squid, an image of snow-covered seats at Lambeau Field was shared on Twitter prior to the Green Bay Packers playoff game against the San Francisco 49ers on Jan. 5.

Some experts are even calling it the new HIV/AIDS of the Americas. But is this comparison accurate, and how big a threat is the disease to the US?\n\nChagas is not a new disease. Its named after Carlos Chagas (circa 1909), a Brazilian doctor who discovered that Triatoma carry a potentially lethal parasite called Trypanosoma cruzi. After several of his patients developed a strange infection that he couldnt identify, Chagas set out to investigate how humans come in contact with the pathogen and its effects on the body of its host. He probably didnt realize at the time that his work would prove to be groundbreaking in the history of epidemiology (Chagas later went on to identify the parasitic fungal genus Pneumocystis, another major discovery).\n\nKissing bugs, named because they bite the face and lips of humans (theyre also called assassin bugs), live in tropical climates near warm-blooded vertebrates to gain easy access to their blood. They stay hidden for much of the day, living in concealed places such as the cracks in a piece of wood and thatched roofs, and usually strike their victims as they sleep. The bugs defecate as they feed, allowing the parasite they carry to infect a new host.\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the early stage of Chagas occurs immediately after infection and may have mild or no symptoms at all. Symptoms generally include fever, malaise, and a swelling of one eye. If left untreated, the infection can continue for years, often with no further symptoms, and over time it damages the heart, intestines and esophagus. There are two known treatments for the disease but they only work when administered in the early stages of infection. Once organ tissue has been damaged, its usually too late.\n\nAccording to an editorial in the online journal PLoS, about 10 million people are currently living with Chagas, making it one of the most common neglected tropical diseases in Latin America and the Caribbean. It kills roughly 20,000 people worldwide every year. Lead author Dr. Peter Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine inHouston, warns that the disease is spreading globally and there may be between 300,000 and 1 million cases in the US.\n\nWhile the infection is triggered by contact with a kissing bug, the disease appears to spread most rapidly via blood transfusions, organ transplants, and from mother to child during pregnancy  hence the comparison with HIV/AIDS.\n\nThere are, however, major differences between Chagas and HIV/AIDS, including that the parasite is not transmitted via sexual contact. And unlike HIV, which evaded detection in the blood supply for years, Chagas can be identified through blood screening and eliminated before it spreads. The problem is that screening requirements differ from country to country, and too often screening procedures are poorly administered or simply ignored.\n\nAlso unlike HIV/AIDSat least in the early days of the diseasewe know proven ways to prevent Chagas infection. Insect nets that prevent kissing bugs from biting humans are effective. Proper screening of the blood supply and reporting the disease are critical steps, as well as screening for the disease during pregnancy.\n\nIs the disease a threat to the US? That depends on where you live. Texans, in particular, may have cause for concern because blood-donation screening is not mandatory in the state and physicians are not required to report the diseases occurrence to health authorities, according to Wired.\n\nWhat we do know is that Chagas is a major problem throughout Central and South America, and will continue to be until measures are taken to prevent its transmission. Unfortunately, those measures require adequate funding, and the countries most afflicted by the disease are also among the poorest. And since people can remain infected for up to 30 years before succumbing, we may have only started to see the true extent of the damage.\n\nYou can find me on Twitter @neuronarrative and at my website, The Daily Brain.\n\nPublic Library of Sciences Neglected Tropical Diseases published an editorial in a medical journal\n\n called the The new AIDS of the Americas, a tropical disease spread by insects called chagas similar to HIV/AIDS epidemic.\n\nThere are a number of striking similarities between people living with Chagas disease and people living with HIV/AIDS, the authors wrote, particularly for those with HIV/AIDS who contracted the disease in the first two decades of the HIV/AIDS epidemic.\n\nUnlike HIV, Chagas is not a s-e-x-u-a-l-l-y transmitted disease: its caused by parasites\n\n transmitted to humans by blood-s-u-c-k-i-n-g insects. Its called the kissing bug. When it ingests your blood, it excretes the parasite at the same time. When you wake up and scratch the itch, the parasite moves into the wound and youre infected.\n\nAccording to Dr. Peter Hotez, a researcher at Baylor College of Medicine and one of the\n\n editorials authors, there are two problems:\n\nFirst, once the heart symptoms start, which is the most dreaded complicationthe Chagas\n\n cardiomyopathythe medicines no longer work very well and second the medicines are extremely toxic.\n\nApparently, more than 8 million people have been infected by Chagas, most of them in Latin and Central America. But more than 300,000 live in the United States.\n\nChagas, also known as American trypanosomiasis, k-i-l-l-s about 20,000 people per year, the journal said. Chagas disease is caused by blood s-u-c-k-i-n-g insects who transmit trypanosomes. watch the video.\n\nA little-known life-threatening illness caused by blood sucking insects has been labelled the new AIDS of the Americas by experts.\n\nThe parasitic illness called Chagas Disease has similarities to the early spread of HIV, according to a new study.\n\nSimilar to AIDS, Chagas is difficult to detect and it can take years for symptoms to emerge, according to experts writing in the journal PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases.\n\nThe new AIDS? A parasitic illness called Chagas disease has been dubbed the new AIDS of the Americas by experts. It is usually transmitted from the bite of blood-sucking insect species called Triatome bugs, which include Kissing bugs (Triatomids)\n\nAn estimated 10 million people worldwide are infected with most sufferers in Bolivia, Mexico, Columbia and Central America, as well as approximately 30,000 people in the U.S., reported the New York Times.\n\nThe disease  once largely contained to Latin America  has spread into the U.S due to increases in travel and immigration.\n\nNamed after the Brazilian doctor who discovered it in 1909, Chagas disease is a potentially deadly illness spread by blood-sucking insects including Triatomids most commonly known as kissing bugs.\n\nLike AIDS, the illness is difficult to detect and has a long remission period.\n\nIt spreads easily through blood transfusions and from mother to child.\n\nApproximately a quarter of victims who contract the disease develop enlarged heart or intestines that can burst causing sudden death.\n\nAn estimated 10 million people worldwide are infected, including 30,000 people in the U.S.\n\nChagas is considered one of the Neglected Parasitic Infections, a group of five parasitic diseases that have been targeted by CDC for public health action.\n\nIt is estimated that in 2008 Chagas disease killed more than 10,000 people.\n\nDue to the severity of the illness, the amount of people infected and the ability of prevention, Chagas is considered one of the Neglected Parasitic Infections, a group of five parasitic diseases that have been targeted by CDC for public health action.\n\nChagas commonly affects people in poverty-stricken areas and most U.S. cases are found in immigrants.\n\nIf caught early enough, the disease can be prevented with an intense 3-month drug treatment.\n\nHowever, because of the lengthy incubation period and costly medication, Chagas is often left untreated.\n\nAlso known as the American trypanosomiasis, the disease spreads easily either through blood transfusions or, less commonly, from mother to child.\n\nAll blood banks in the U.S. and Latin America screen for traces of the disease.\n\nMost blood banks in the U.S began screening for it in 2007.\n\nChagas is usually transmitted from the bite of blood-sucking insect species called Triatome bugs which release a parasite called Trypanosoma cruzi into the victims bloodstream.\n\nThe species includes Triatomids  black wingless beetles about 20mm in length commonly known as kissing bugs. Their closest relative is the Tsetse fly, found in Africa, which spread Sleeping Sickness (where the victims brain swells).\n\nChagas disease comes in two phases  acute and severe.\n\nThe acute phase may have no symptoms but can present a fever, general feeling of being unwell and swelling in one eye.\n\nVictim: Charles Darwin may have contracted the disease as he travelled the globe on HMS Beagle in his 20s\n\nAfter the acute phase the disease goes into remission and it can take years before symptoms, such as constipation, abdomen pain and digestive problems, emerge again in the severe stage.\n\nThe parasite can eventually make its way to the heart, where it can live and multiply.\n\nAbout a quarter of the people who contract Chagas, develop enlarged heart or intestines that can burst causing sudden death.\n\nAlthough the drugs available are not as expensive as those for AIDS, there are shortages of the medication in poorer countries and little money is being spent on discovering new treatments.\n\nChagas disease is named after Carlos Ribeiro Justiniano Chagas, a Brazilian doctor who first discovered the disease in 1909.\n\nResearchers from the University of Maryland School of Medicine said last year that they believed Charles Darwin suffered from three different illnesses, including a Chagas infection.\n\nThe experts believe he contracted the disease during a five-year trip around the globe on the HMS Beagle in his 20s  and attributed it to his death of heart failure 47 years later.\n\nThe father of modern life scientists wrote in his journal that he had been bitten by a wingless black bug during the expedition, where he visited South America.\n\nSoft Ticks are characterized by a tough leathery integument and a flattened oval shape when examined dorsally. The Argasidae lack the dorsal shield present in the Hard Ticks (Ixodidae), and need to be examined ventrally to observe their capitulum or mouthparts. Soft ticks generally have a world-wide distribution, with the most important disease vector Ornithodoros populatingEurope, Africa, Asia and the Americas.\n\nSoft ticks have a hemimetabolous life cycle, with eggs hatching six legged larvae, which molt to eight legged nymphs. There are five to seven larval instars depending on the species, with each stage requiring a blood meal to proceed. Larvae of Ornithodoros moubata do not require a blood meal to molt to the nymph stage. Adult females lay small egg batches following each blood meal. The duration of the life cycle depends on the temperature, host availability, and inherently the particular species in question.\n\nThe adults are flat and oval in outline and have tough, leathery, wrinkled bodies. The mouthparts are situated underneath the body and are not visible from above. The eggs are laid in the places where the adults rest, such as cracks and crevices in the walls and floors of houses and in furniture. The larva, the five nymphal stages and the adults all actively search for hosts from which to take blood-meals. After feeding, which lasts about 30 minutes, they drop to the ground. Most species can survive for more than a year between blood-meals, and some for more than 10 years.\n\nThe soft ticks live apart from their hosts and are most common in the nests and resting places of the animals on which they feed. Some species, such as the chicken tick and the pigeon tick (Argasspecies) may feed on humans when the preferred hosts are not available.\n\nSpecies that commonly feed on humans are found around villages and inside houses. Their habits are comparable to those of bedbugs: ticks often emerge from hiding places at night to suck the blood of humans and animals. Some species are common on travel routes, in rest houses and camping sites, and in caves and crevices.\n\nSoft Ticks are vectors for serious disease including tick borne relapsing fever (Borrelia duttoni), rickettsial disease (Coxiella burneti), and some arboviruses. The most important disease spread by soft ticks is tick borne relapsing fever which occurs world-wide and is spread by spirochete infected Ornithodoros. Q-fever and arboviruses can be spreadfollowing a blood meal, but are both primarily introduced into the population by the Hard Ticks.\n\nThis disease is caused by a microorganism of the genus Borrelia. It is transmitted by biting soft ticks of the genus Ornithodoros in many countries in the tropics and subtropics and also in Europe and North America. The ticks usually feed quickly at night in or near houses, and then leave the host.\n\nThe disease causes bouts of fever alternating with periods without fever. Death occurs in about 2-10% of persons who are untreated.\n\nTreatment is possible with tetracycline or its derivatives.\n\nPrevention requires measures to control soft ticks and to avoid their bites.\n\nHard ticks appear flattened when examined dorsally and can be primarily characterized by the presence of a dorsal plate or scutum, and a capitulum that projects beyond the body outline. The scutum regularly covers the entire dorsal area, although females may have a reduced plate present directly behind the capitulum. Ixodes spp. inhabit in Canada, Europe, Asiatic Russia, China, Japan, and Australia.\n\nImage 12-3.

Dermacentor variabilis  male  showing the scutum covering the whole length of the body (left); Dermacentor variabilis  female  showing the scutum covering half the length of the body (right) (Image courtesy of: Iowa State University)\n\nHard Ticks have a hemimetabolous life cycle similar to that of the Soft Ticks. Hard tick larvae search for suitable hosts, feed for several days, and drop off engorged to the ground below. Molting to the nymph stage follows several days later and the tick again searches for a suitable blood source. There is only one nymphal stage in Ixodes, and following several weeks of stasis the nymph will molt into an adult. Females lay one large mass of eggs, which forms a cellular mass on the scutum of the ovipositing female.\n\nHard ticks transmit a variety of diseases including Lyme Disease, Tick Paralysis, Rickettsia, arboviruses that are responsible for encephalitis and hemorrhagic fevers, tularemia and Babesia microtiinfection. Tick paralysis is caused by the toxins present in the saliva of the tick, and is introduced during feeding.\n\nLyme disease is a serious ailment caused by the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi. Lyme disease results in acute erythema, systematic lesions and eventually chronic involvement of multiple organs.\n\nRickettsiae diseases spread by Ixodes include Q-fever (Coxiella burneti) and arboviruses that cause serious encephalitis.\n\nBabesia microti infection primarily involves animals, with Man as an accidental host. The parasite is present in the tick salivary glands and is passed to Man via tick bite. Once in the bloodstream, the parasites enter the erythrocytes. Infection with B. microti ranges from asymptomatic to severe illness. Symptoms generally resemble those of malaria with fever, rigors, myalgia, and malaise. Occasionally there is mild or moderate hemolytic anemia and jaundice (renal failure). Parasitemia can be up to 25% in the immunocompetent individual, and up to 80% in patients who have been splenectomized.\n\nSeveral other species of ticks are also responsible for the spread of disease throughout the world. Wood ticks (Dermacentor andersoni) are found in the mountainous west of North America; dog ticks (Rhipicephalus) are found in coastal areas. Lone Star ticks (Amblyomma americanum) are found in forests in SE USA where deer are found. The females of these species are known to cause a condition known as tick paralysis.\n\nImage 12-7. Amblyomma, hard tick. The scutum is so-called enameled colored areas, and is described as being an ornate species. (SOURCE: PHIL 5981  CDC)\n\nImage 12-8. Dermacentor variabilis, ticks of this species show very ornate scutums, covering the length of the body (left  male). When blood engorged it is harder to see the scutum (right  female). (SOURCE: PHIL 5977  CDC)\n\nHard Ticks have a hemimetabolous life cycle similar to that of the soft ticks. Hard tick larvae search for suitable hosts feed for several days, and drop off engorged to the ground below. Molting to the nymph stage follows several days later and the tick again searches for a suitable blood source. There is only one nymphal stage in Ixodes, and following several weeks of stasis the nymph will molt into an adult. Females lay one large mass of eggs, which forms a cellular mass on the scutum of the ovipositing female.\n\nBoth Dermacentor and Amblyomma transmit Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever (Rickettsia rickettsia). The different strains transmitted by these species vary in their virulence and subsequent manifestation of the disease. Dermacentor are known to transmit serious arboviruses responsible for encephalitis and hemorrhagic fevers. D. variabilis are also responsible for spreading tularemia (Francisella tularensis) and human granulocytic erlichiosis (Ehrlichia chaffeensis). Rhipicephalus sanguineus transmits Mediterranean Spotted Fever and African Tick Typhus.\n\nHard ticks inject into the body with their saliva certain toxins that can cause a condition in people and animals called tick paralysis. It appears 5-7 days after a tick begins feeding, paralyzing the legs and affecting speaking ability, swallowing and breathing. It occurs worldwide and is most common and severe in children aged up to two years. Treatment involves removing the tick.\n\nThis group of diseases is caused by closely related Rickettsia microorganisms transmitted by tick bites or contamination of the skin with crushed tissues or feces of the tick.\n\n Spotted fever due to Rickettsia rickettsii occurs in Brazil, Canada, Colombia, Mexico, Panama and the USA.\n\n Spotted fever due to R. sibirica occurs in Japan, the Russian Federation and the Pacific.\n\n Spotted fever due to R. conori is found in the Mediterranean region, Africa and southern Asia.\n\n Q fever, caused by Coxiella burneti, has a worldwide distribution and is commonly present in abattoirs, meat-packing and meat-rendering plants, diagnostic laboratories, stockyards and poultry farms. It is transmitted to humans mainly by the consumption of milk and meat from contaminated cattle or the inhalation of dried infected tick feces by people working with cattle.\n\nSymptoms in humans are sudden fever persisting for several weeks, malaise, muscle and joint pains, severe headache and chills. A rash sometimes spreads over the entire body. Death may result in about 15-20% of persons if the disease is misdiagnosed or left untreated.\n\nAntibiotics such as tetracycline or chloramphenicol can be used.\n\nTick bites should be avoided and attached ticks should be removed rapidly and carefully. Several hours of attachment are needed before the Rickettsia organisms can infect humans.\n\nLyme disease (erythema chronicum migrans) is a severe and often debilitating condition caused by a spirochete, Borrelia burgdorferi. Acute Lyme disease is a flu-like illness, characterized by an expanding red rash in about 50% of patients, accompanied by fever, fatigue, and muscle and joint pain. Weeks or even months after the infecting tick bite, patients may experience swelling and pain in large joints (knee, elbow), encephalitis, facial palsy, ocular lesions and carditis, irrespective of whether a rash occurred in the acute phase. Later, perhaps years after the bite, there may be cartilage erosion (arthritis) and neuromuscular dysfunction (Fig. 4.29). Lyme disease occurs principally in northern temperate regions of the world, including China, Europe, the USA and the former USSR.\n\nIllustration 12-5. A typical symptom of Lyme disease is swelling and pain in the large joints, such as the knees, and chronic arthritis. (SOURCE: Unknown)\n\nThe disease is transmitted mostly by Ixodes ticks, commonly in the summer when the nymphs are abundant. Small rodents, especially mice, serve as reservoirs of infection while large mammals serve principally as hosts maintaining tick populations. The larvae acquire infection while feeding on mice, and nymphs or adults can transmit spirochetes during subsequent blood-meals. In the northern temperate zone, where it occurs most intensely, Lyme disease has become more common as deer populations have increased and as this critical host has adapted to living in closer proximity to people. In many areas, Lyme disease is acquired in the suburban residential environment.\n\nFurther development of the disease in adults may be reduced or prevented by treatment with tetracycline or its derivatives for 2-4 weeks, and in children by treatment with penicillin.\n\nPrevention requires avoidance of tick habitats and bites, and vector control. Personal protection may be possible by the use of repellents on the skin and clothing in tick-infested areas. The removal of attached ticks within 24 hours may prevent spirochete transmission. Prophylactic antibiotic therapy may be desirable following the bite of an infected tick. New molecular assays are commercially available for detecting the spirochetes in tick samples.\n\nTularemia, also known as rabbit fever, deerfly fever and OHara disease, is caused by the infectious agent Francisella tularensis. The symptoms, which vary according to how the agent enters the body, include headache, chills, fever and the swelling of lymph nodes. The disease occurs in Europe, Japan, North America and the former USSR.\n\nTransmission takes place through the bites of ticks and deerflies (see Chapter 1) or as a result of handling infected animals such as rabbits and other game. Hunters and forest workers are at the highest risk of infection.\n\nAntibiotics such as streptomycin can be used to treat the disease.\n\nTick bites and tick habitats should be avoided, impermeable gloves should be worn when skinning and dressing game animals, wild game meat should be thoroughly cooked, and untreated drinking-water should be avoided in areas where the disease occurs.\n\nThis is a group of viral diseases causing acute inflammation of the brain, spinal cord and meninges. The symptoms vary in severity with the type of disease. Many infections do not result in disease. Severe infections may cause violent headaches, high fever, nausea, coma and death.\n\n Far Eastern tick-borne encephalitis is found in the far east of the former USSR.\n\n Central European tick-borne encephalitis occurs in Europe from the Urals to France.\n\n Louping ill is a disease of sheep in the United Kingdom which sometimes affects people.\n\nThese diseases are transmitted by biting ticks and by the consumption of milk from infected animals. No specific treatment is available but vaccines have been developed against some of the diseases. Prevention requires avoidance or rapid removal of ticks.\n\nUsually various tick species act as vectors for any one disease and their importance varies from region to region.\n\n\n\nOmsk hemorrhagic fever is found in south-western Siberia; it causes severe disease and death in muskrat handlers; it is mainly waterborne, although it is found in hard ticks.\n\nColorado tick fever is a moderately severe disease that occurs in western North America.\n\nCrimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever is an acute, often severe and fatal disease found in parts of Africa, Asia and Europe.\n\nDermatophagoides, the common dust mite, commonly inhabit beds, mattresses, carpets and house dust. They are motile and feed on residual organic debris and are typically 0.3 m in length. They characteristically have four long legs with suckers and pincer chelicerae.\n\nDemodex folliculorum mites are 300 microns in length, live in the follicle for 5-6 days and migrate onto contiguous skin at night. Classically, they appear as 1 m sleeves around the base of the eyelashes.\n\nThe mite, Sarcoptes scabiei, lives exclusively on human skin and causes scabies. It is small (the larger female is 0.3-0.4m), colorless and oval with 8 short legs.\n\nImage 12-12. Picture of the human parasite scabies (Sarcoptes scabiei). They live exclusively on human skin causing the condition known as scabies. (SOURCE: PHIL 3810  CDC/Joe Miller/Reed and Crnrick pharmaceuticals.)\n\nadultsare normally reddish and covered with velvet like hair. It is the larvae that are parasitic and they too regularly appear reddish, but only have three pairs of legs. The palps are segmented, and the mouthparts are large and easily identifiable. Leptotrombidium larvae are distinguished by large eyes, two feathered sensillae and five feathered setae that are present on the scutum.\n\nDermatophagoides are antigenic, even when dead (fecal pellets are also allergenic), and are associated with complex allergies with symptoms such as asthma, perennial rhinitis, conjunctivitis and atopic dermatitis. A diagnosis can be made using reactive skin tests and treatment involves removal of accumulated antigens from mattresses and pillows.\n\nDemodex have been implicatedin dermatitis, acne and should be considered in chronic, therapy-resistant cases of blepharitis. The role of this mite in ocular disease is uncertain. Washing with soap and water is the most effective method of prevention.\n\nSymptoms of Sarcoptes infection arise after 4-6 weeks and comprise a papular pruritic eruption at a site often unrelated to the site of infestation; symptoms of secondary infestations arise almost immediately. Zoonotic scabies have shorter incubation periods but are also self-limiting. Persistent nodular scabies comprises itchy erythematous or scabbed nodules, often on the penis. When the immune system is impaired, Norwegian (crusted) scabies may develop: this presents with erythema and hyperkeratosis but little itching.\n\nDiagnosis demands discovery of the mites, scybala or eggs by epidermal shave biopsy or superficial scraping. Burrows are best seen on wrists and interdigital spaces. They fluoresce under a Woods lamp after application of liquid tetracycline and, later, alcohol; alternatively ink may be used. Lindane (Quellada) lotion is the treatment of choice in the USA; permethrin or crotamiton are alternatives. Ivermectin has been recommended for Norwegian scabies. Malathion (Derbac-M) liquid or permethrin are recommended in the UK (benzyl benzoate is also active). Malathion should be avoided in infants and lindane should be avoided in pregnancy, breast-feeding and young children. Treatment is applied over the whole body except the head and neck and washed off after 24 hours. Normal laundering of bed linen and clothes is recommended. Household and sexual contacts should also be treated. Symptoms may continue after treatment because of persisting antigens, Calamine or Eurax lotion may be used; other problems include reinfestation and secondary bacterial infection.\n\nFeeding by Leptotrobidium causes cellular damage and initially results in intense itching and irritation for the host. The agent of scrub typhus, Rickettsia tsutsugamuchi, is often transmitted by the larval trombiculid mite. Scrub typhus results in infection in those living or working near mite islands which are usually found in transitional vegetation and provide a stable environment for mite proliferation. Prevention has generally been with chemical repellents or herbicides to remove the scrub habitat.\n\nAedes \n\n (SOURCE: PHIL 9261  CDC/ Prof. Frank Hadley Collins, Dir., Cntr. for Global Health and Infectious Diseases, Univ. of Notre Dame)\n\nMosquitoes are small with a clearly demarcated body and very long slender legs. The head contains a large pair of kidney shaped compound eyes, a pair of antennae, and a single long proboscis for feeding. The thorax, abdomen and wings are often covered with scales. Differential coloration and pattern of these scales provides a means of visually distinguishing species. The large wings are folded over the segmented abdomen, which generally appears brown-black and slender but turns a bright red and swells following feeding.\n\nImage of a typical Culicine mosquito. Adults are generally brown  black, at rest they place their abdomens parallel to the ground. (SOURCE: PHIL 4487  CDC)\n\nMosquitoes may be classified as Anopheline (Anopheles) or Culicine (Aedes, Culex). The antennae of male mosquitoes are plumose (many feathery hairs); females are pilose (few spidery hairs). The male Anopheline palps are long and clubbed; those of the male Culicine are long but not clubbed. The female Anopheline palps are long; the female Culicine are short. If a mosquito is incorrectly sexed, a female Anopheline may be confused with a male Culicine.\n\nIllustration 12-6. Image of typical male Anopheline mosquito showing the characteristic features of the mosquitoes head; the palps are as long as the proboscis with clubbed like ends and the antennae are plumose. The female Culicine mosquito shows the short palps and the pilose antennae. (SOURCE: CDC)\n\nAt rest, Anophelines usually position their abdomens at an angle to the surface; Culicines maintain their abdomen in a parallel position.\n\nIllustration 12-7. Typical Anopheline and Culicine at rest, showing the abdomen at an angle to the surface.\n\nAnopheles lay 50 to 200 dark color eggs in aquatic environments, and hatch in several days to several weeks depending on the external temperature. Anopheles larvae have a dark brown head and 6-7 anterior segments covered with dorsal palmate hairs. Accessory tegral plates are present on the dorsal side of segments 1-10 and two sets of anal papillae emerge from the last abdominal segment.\n\nThere are four larval instars that survive by filter feeding and breathing oxygen through their spiracles. Anopheles larvae occur throughout many different habitats including both permanent marshes and swamps, and temporary locations such as pots filled with water. In general Anopheles prefer to inhabit clean habitats. The larval period lasts about a week, but may be extended depending on the environmental conditions. The pupa is comma shaped with a set of trumpet shaped breathing tubes. The abdomen is covered with setae, and segments 2-7 have distinct spines. The pupal period may last a few days to weeks depending on the temperature.\n\nAnopheles are vectors of malaria, Bancroftian and Brugian filariasis and of multiple arboviruses (dengue fever; yellow fever; encephalitides and hemorrhagic fevers). Malaria is caused by Plasmodium falciparum, P. vivax, P. malariae and P. ovale. Transmission of the disease occurs in virtually all of tropical Africa, Central and South America, and the Middle and Far East. South East Asia is a particular problem due to multiple drug resistance. P. falciparum is found in Africa and other tropical countries as well as in subtropics. P. malariae has a low prevalence in both tropics and subtropics. P .vivax is the most widespread in temperate regions and subtropics but may also be found in the tropics. P. ovale has a low prevalence in West Africa. In Africa alone, 370 million people live in endemic areas.\n\nP .vivax causes benign tertian malaria (43% of cases) and P. falciparum results in malignant tertian or sub-tertian malaria and pernicious malaria (50% of cases). P .ovale (mild tertian malaria, 1% of cases) and P. malariae (quartan malaria, 7% of cases) contribute a small percentage of malarial cases.\n\nClinical features including fever and chills are due to the host inflammatory response and are associated with rupture of erythrocytic schizonts. Fever presents in three stages  a) Cold: rigors and fever lasting 15 minutes to 1 hour; b) Hot: the patient is flushed with tachycardia and is pyrexial (40C) for 2-6 hours; c) Sweating: the temperature falls (over 2-4 hours). Each paroxysm lasts 8-12 hours in total. All erythrocytes containing a trophozoite will be destroyed within 48-72 hours. Periodic fever often takes more than seven days to develop, and anemia can be hemolytic or due to toxic marrow suppression. Splenomegaly occurs in all malaria: it may be acute or chronic (+/- hypersplenism). Jaundice may be hemolytic and/or hepatic (only P. falciparum). In addition, there may be headache, myalgia, arthralgia, diarrhea and vomiting.\n\nPlasmodium falciparum is the most virulent form (invades mature and immature RBCs) and is often fatal if untreated. Blood schizogony takes place in deep capillaries and micro-circulatory failure can occur in individuals with little immunity to malaria. It does not relapse but recrudescence may occur. The time between paroxysms is 48 hours but fever may last for 24-36 hours. Very rapid progression and complications include diarrhea and vomiting; delirium; coma; convulsions; renal failure, including hemoglobinuria (blackwater fever); jaundice; pulmonary edema; hypoglycemia and abortion. Cerebral malaria often results in delirium, disorientation, stupor, coma, convulsions and death.\n\nP. vivax / ovale exhibit 48 hours between paroxysms; relapses may occur up to 8 years after primary infection and only infects immature RBCs of those with Duffy blood group. Plasmodium malariaegenerally results in 72 hours between paroxysms, only infects older RBCs, and recrudescence may occur decades after primary infection.\n\nThe global malaria situation is serious and becoming worse: 300-500 million clinical cases occur annually. 1.5-2.7 million people die of malaria each year with approximately one million deaths among children under five years of age are attributed to malaria alone or in combination with other diseases. Countries in tropical Africa account for more than 90% of the total malaria incidence and the great majority of malaria deaths (WHO data). The death toll of African children with malaria is expected to double by 2010, conceivably reaching four million deaths per year. Many factors influence the epidemiology of this disease including: breeding habits of the various mosquito vectors; agricultural practices; economic conditions; industrialization and pesticide use. Increasing air-traffic from malaria endemic areas has led to the possibility of malaria developing in non-endemic areas where the mosquito vector has been imported onboard aircraft.\n\nIf the infective species is not known, or the infection is known to be mixed, initial treatment should be with quinine, mefloquine or rarely halofantrine. Falciparum (malignant) malaria is often resistant to chloroquine and should be treated with quinine, mefloquine, halofantrine, quinidine or pyrimethamine-sulphadoxine. Benign malaria (P. vivax) should be treated with chloroquine although resistance has been reported from New Guinea. Malarial prophylaxis is relative and not absolute.\n\nThe UK Consensus Group on Malaria Prophylaxis (1997) recommend mefloquine for UK travelers to West, Central and East Africa for periods of greater than two weeks and for travelers to specific areas within south-east Asia: prophylaxis should be commenced two weeks before departure. Doxycycline can be used in older children and adults who cannot tolerate mefloquine.\n\nPrevention is most dependent upon coverage of exposed skin and the use of insect repellent, mosquito nets impregnated with permethrin and correct prophylaxis. The vector may be controlled by water clearance programs, house spraying (DDT) and destruction of breeding areas. Drug resistance to DDT and ethical resistance to its use have limited its effectiveness. Natural immunity involves both antibody and cell-mediated systems and appears to require frequent boosting; antigens from different stages of the parasites life cycle will be important in vaccine development.\n\nAnopheline mosquitoes also transmit the filarial worms Wuchereria bancrofti, Brugia malayi and Brugia timori. Wuchereria bancrofti is the main cause of elephantiasis (Bancroftian filariasis) and the most widely distributed filarial parasite of man. The adults live in the lymphatic system, and can survive for 30 years or more. Once they have mated they produce a pre-larval form, the microfilaria. Both the adults and the microfilaria may play a role in generating the symptoms and signs. Microfilaria measure 240-300mm in length by 7-10mm in width. They are sheathed (derived from ovum membrane) and nuclei terminate 15-20mm proximal to the pointed tail. There are fewer, more distinct nuclei than in other species and there are less body curves. Adult worms are slender and white (males 4cm; females stout and 10cm in length)\n\nInitial infection with Wuchereria is usually asymptomatic. There may be recurrence of attacks of cellulitis affecting the limbs, breast, scrotum or elsewhere. Infection is associated with fever, lymphangitis, lymphadenopathy and occasionally abscess formation. These initially settle but later on the tissues eventually become edematous and hypertrophied. Further effects may include scrotal involvement and hydrocoele, which can lead to scrotal enlargement and lymph scrotum. This is elephantiasis and is associated with dermal hypertrophy, verrucous changes and the rupture of lymph varices into various sites.\n\nBrugian (Malayan) filariasis is less widespread, less common and less serious than its Bancroftian counterpart. The life cycle is identical to that of Wuchereria bancrofti with Brugia malayi limited to Asia and B. timori restricted to Indonesia. Infection results in lymphadenopathy involving most frequently the inguinal area, lymphoedema normally below the knee, eosinophilia, and in rare cases chyluria.\n\nDiethylcarbamazine (DEC) kills microfilaria. Ivermectin suppresses microfilaria production but its overall effectiveness remains untried and elephantiasis can be treated surgically. Control measures comprise draining of mosquito breeding sites and killing larvae. Many mosquitoes are resistant to insecticides but mosquito repellents and nets are effective. The infective pool may be reduced by periodic mass treatment with DEC. Brugia malayi is more susceptible to diethylcarbamazine (DEC) than is Wuchereria bancrofti. Anopheline larvae may be suffocated in their breeding sites but Culicine larvae (Mansonia sp.) derive oxygen from plants and are not vulnerable to such measures. Control depends upon the use of mosquito nets and periodic mass treatment.\n\nAedes can generally be distinguished by patterns of black and silvery scales present on the abdomen and thorax. The legs appear to have black and white rings along their length. The wings are generally covered with black scales. Aedes breed in marshes and other wetland areas and have a worldwide distribution.\n\nImage 12-17. Typical Aedesmosquito. They are clearly distinguished from Anopheline mosquitoes due to the presence of black and slivery scales on the abdomen and thorax. (SOURCE: PHIL 9252  CDC/ Prof. Frank Hadley Collins, Dir., Cntr. for Global Health and Infectious Diseases, Univ. of Notre Dame)\n\nFemale Aedes lay eggs on damp areas such mud, detritus, clay and rock. The eggs are very robust and can survive desiccation and other environmental pressures. The eggs hatch in waves depending on the environmental cues. Aedes larvae have a stout barrel shaped siphon with one pair of subventral tufts. There are three pairs of setae on the ventral brush, and large setae are not present on the abdominal segments.\n\nAedes are vectors of Bancroftian filariasis and arboviruses such as yellow fever and dengue. Wuchereria bancrofti is the main cause of elephantiasis (Bancroftian filariasis) and the most widely distributed filarial parasite of Man. The adults live in the lymphatic system, and can survive for 30 years or more. They copulate and generate a pre-larval form, the microfilaria. Both the adults and the microfilaria may play a role in generating the symptoms and signs. Microfilaria measure 240-300mm in length by 7-10mm in width. They are sheathed (derived from ovum membrane) and nuclei terminate 15-20mm proximal to the pointed tail. There are fewer, more distinct nuclei than in other species and there are less body curves. Adult worms are slender and white (males 4cm; females, stout and 10cm in length).\n\nInitial infection with Wuchereria is usually asymptomatic. There may be recurrence of attacks of cellulitis affecting the limbs, breast, scrotum or elsewhere. Infection is associated with fever, lymphangitis, lymphadenopathy and occasionally abscess formation. These initially settle but later on the tissues eventually become edematous and hypertrophied. Further effects may include scrotal involvement and hydrocoele, which can lead to scrotal enlargement and lymph scrotum. This is elephantiasis and is associated with dermal hypertrophy, verrucous changes and the rupture of lymph varices into various sites.\n\nYellow fever and dengue hemorrhagic fever are serious viral infections spread by the Aedes mosquito. Dengue is now the most important mosquito borne virus, with global infection increasing.\n\nIn general the most effective control for Culicine mosquitoes are repellents and fine screening or netting. Treatment with insecticides will also serve to reduce the vector population, but increased problems are encountered with Culicines because they also feed during the daytime. If filarial infection occurs, treatment with Diethylcarbamazine (DEC) will kill microfilaria. Ivermectin suppresses microfilaria production but its overall effectiveness remains untried and elephantiasis can be treated surgically.\n\nCulex are distinguished by their lack of coloration and feature. The thorax, abdomen, legs and wings are often covered with brown-black scales giving a generally dark appearance. The abdomen may occasionally also have white scales arranged in segments. Culex breeds mainly in aquatic habitats, often in areas containing large quantities of organic waste.\n\nIllustration 12-8. Typical illustration of a Culexmosquito, showing the characteristic brown-black scales on the thorax, abdomen, legs and wings giving it a general dark appearance. (Illustration: Trustees of the British Museum)\n\nImage 12-18. ACulexmosquitotaking a blood meal from a human host. The abdomen becomes distended and blood red in color. (SOURCE: PHIL 4464  CDC/Jim Gathany)\n\nFemale Culex lay dark brown eggs in characteristic clumps of approximately 300 eggs. As mentioned these eggs are often found in organic waste deposits or polluted waters. Culex larvae have a long and narrow siphon with more than one pair of subventral tufts.\n\nCulex mosquitoes are vectors of Bancroftian filariasis throughout Africa, but most importantly arboviruses such as Japanese encephalitis. Encephalitis occurs throughout the world, with Culex acting as an important vector for spread and infection. Culex mosquitoes are similar to Culicine mosquitoes, but prefer to bite at night and breed in organic refuse.\n\nCulex mosquitoes are most easily controlled by improving sanitation and removing static water sources from the affected area. In general the most effective control for Culex mosquitoes are also repellents and fine screening or netting. Treatment with insecticides will also serve to reduce the vector population, but increased problems are encountered with Culicine mosquitoes because they also feed during the daytime. If filarial infection occurs treatment with Diethylcarbamazine (DEC) will kill microfilaria. Ivermectin suppresses microfilaria production but its overall effectiveness remains untried and elephantiasis can be treated surgically.\n\nTsetse flies are large, yellow-brown or brown-black and measure 6-15m in length. They are distinguished by a rigid projecting proboscis and a long pair of accompanying palps. There is a characteristic axe-shaped venation of the wings when viewed dorsally resembling an inverted hatchet in the central cell. The antennae appear short and feathery, and the abdomen is segmented and often striped or patched. Both males and females suck blood every 4-5 days, outside in open spaces.\n\nImage 12-19. Typical illustration of a Tsetse Fly. They are yellow-brown in Colour and usually measure 6  15m in length. Their characteristic feature is the hatchet shaped cell in the centre of the wing venation. (IMAGE SOURCE: Trustees of the British Museum)\n\nFemale Tsetse flies are unique in the sense that they deposit larvae and do not lay eggs. The eggs mature within the female and are supplied with essential nourishment to complete larval development. This cycle requires a large number of blood meals to maintain and thus the female requires regular feeding. The larvae are normally deposited in shaded areas. There are three larval instars with the mature larva appearing white, visibly segmented with a pair of lobes at the posterior end. Pupation of the third instar results in a dark colored puparium with posterior lobes. The pupal period is extended (3-7 weeks) depending on the surrounding environmental conditions.\n\nTsetse flies are vectors for African sleeping sickness (Trypanosoma brucei sp. The two subspecies of T. brucei that infect Man are morphologically identical. T. b. gambiense causes Gambian sleeping sickness in Western Africa and T. b. rhodesiense causes Rhodesian sleeping sickness in East Africa. Another subspecies, T. b. brucei, causes nagana in cattle.\n\nDistribution of African Trypanosomiasis throughout Africa (WHO, 1991)\n\nInitially the patient has a headache, fever, chills and loss of appetite but specific clinical signs are absent. Parasitaemia comes in characteristic waves. Later, the spleen, liver and lymph nodes enlarge (Winterbottoms sign). Finally, there may be CNS involvement leading to coma and death within several years. Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense (rural East Africa): this is so acute that the patient invariably dies before classical symptoms develop. Without appropriate treatment, both forms are fatal.\n\nHuman African trypanosomiasis is rural and focal, with humans as the principal reservoir of infection of T. b. gambiense, and domestic cattle and wild animals as important reservoirs of T. b. rhodesiense. By the 1960s, it had been brought under control, but since 1970 the situation has deteriorated and the disease has reappeared, with major flare-ups in countries which have not maintained surveillance activities. It is estimated that 55-60 million people are exposed to the risk of becoming infected with trypanosomiasis, but only four million of them are under active surveillance or have access to health centers where reliable diagnosis is available: the estimated number of infected persons is over 300,000 (WHO data).\n\nAnemia and other infections should be treated first. If given before the parasite has invaded the brain (hemolymphatic stage), suramin (Rhodesian disease) or pentamidine (Gambian disease) appear to be effective. For late disease (CNS involvement), drugs of choice are melarsoprol or eflornithine, with tryparsamide plus suramin as an alternative. Tsetse-infested areas should be avoided. Protective, light-colored clothing and repellents should be used. Tsetse flies are difficult to treat with insecticide (DDT has been tried) as their larvae live in burrows in the ground; protective vegetation must first be removed. Pentamidine prophylaxis is no longer advocated. Reservoir hosts should be identified and removed. It is possible to breed resistant or tolerant cattle (West Africa). Trypanosomes other thanT. brucei are also transmissible by Tabanid flies or by sexual contact.\n\nSandflies are small (1.5-5m) with a hairy head, thorax, antennae and wings. The antennae are long, may appear beaded, and protrude near a large set of black compound eyes. The wings are upwardly pointing at rest, and are a distinctive feature of Phlebotomine sandflies. Only the females are blood feeders, the males feed on plant nectar. Biting predominates nocturnally and they rest in moist and dark walls, cracks and tree trunks during the day.\n\nIllustration 12-10. Typical illustration of a Sand Fly. The head, thorax, abdomen, legs and antennae are hairy, they are small usually measuring 1.5-5m long. (Phlebotomus) (Illustration Source: Trustees of the British Museum)\n\nFemale Phlebotomine sandflies deposit 30-70 minute eggs at each oviposition. The eggs are laid in dry areas, but require humidity to avoid desiccating. There are four instars and the mature larva is characterized by a distinct black head, 12 segments, thick bristles covering the body, and two pairs of caudal setae on their posterior end. As with other fly vectors the length of the larval stage depends on the ambient temperature, species in question, and food availability. The larval skin and caudal bristles remain attached at the posterior end during the pupal stage which lasts 5-10 days.\n\nSandflies are the only vectors for several species and subspecies of obligate intracellular protozoa responsible for leishmaniasis (Leishmania sp.) Cutaneous, mucocutaneous and visceral leishmaniasis are caused by different species of Leishmania contentiously linked to temperature preferences. Geographic location and host immune response also play a role in determining the form of disease.Leishmania tropica and L. major cause dermal cutaneous leishmaniasis; visceral leishmaniasis (kala-azar) is caused by L. donovani and mucocutaneous leishmaniasis is caused by L. braziliensis andL. mexicana. Visceral leishmaniasis in Europe is caused by L.infantum with dogs as the main reservoir. Leishmania tropica is found in the Middle East, North Africa, India and the Mediterranean. Leishmania donovani is found in the old and new worlds: South America, the Mediterranean, North and East Africa, India and China. Leishmania braziliensis is found in Central and South America. Leishmania mexicana is found in North and Central America, Texas and Mexico.\n\nDermal cutaneous leishmaniasis or Old World leishmaniasis is also known as Tropical or Oriental Sore or Delhi Boil and is generally localized to the skin surrounding the bite of the Phlebotomussandfly. The ulcers (volcano sign) are draining but produce dry ulcers that crust over. They usually resolve within one year but superinfection (yaws or myiasis) may occur and immunity develops. Cutaneous leishmaniasis affects over 300,000 people. The mucosal form affects the mucosa of the nose, pharynx, palate, larynx and upper lip causing ulcers that often become secondarily infected. Scarring can lead to death from pneumonia.\n\nVisceral leishmaniasis, or Kala-azar is transmitted by Phlebotomus sandflies and is spread via the lymphatics from an often minor cutaneous lesion. They multiply in macrophages to form Leishman-Donovan bodies. Symptoms are usually chronic and comprise malaise, lymphadenopathy, cough, diarrhea, wasting and anemia, bleeding, and low-grade fever (3/day); liver and spleen enlarge and visibly distend the abdomen. Untreated, death ensues within three years, usually from secondary infection.\n\nLeishmaniasis currently affects some 12 million people in 88 countries, all but 16 of which are in the developing world. It is estimated that 350 million people are exposed to the risk of infection by the different species of Leishmania parasite. The annual incidence of new cases is about two million (1.5 million of cutaneous leishmaniasis, and 0.5 million of visceral leishmaniasis). Recently, the WHO has reported an increase in overlapping of visceral leishmaniasis (VL) and HIV infection due to the spread of the AIDS pandemic. Leishmania / HIV co-infection is considered to be a real emerging disease, especially in southern Europe, where 25-70% of adult VL cases are related to HIV infection, and 1.5-9.5% of AIDS cases suffer from newly acquired or reactivated VL. Intravenous drug users have been identified as the main population at risk.\n\nDermal leishmaniasis usually resolves spontaneously. Visceral leishmaniasis is treated with extended courses of antimonial compounds (e.g. sodium stibogluconate or meglumine antimonate) and dietary supplementation (pentamidine isethionate has been used in antimony-resistant cases). WHO regimes are changing and pentamidine may be used. Mucocutaneous leishmaniasis is also treated with antimonial compounds. However, only around 50% of patients respond to antimonial compounds and relapses are seen. Pentamidine isethionate, paromomycin (aminosidine), allopurinol, ketoconazole, itraconazole, interferon gamma and liposomal amphotericin B have all been used; amphotericin B appears the most effective. Control of sandflies is difficult although buildings may be sprayed with insecticide. Sandflies cannot bite through clothing. Repellents are effective although mosquito nets are of limited value (sandflies are 3 m). Sandflies are nocturnal and can be avoided. Rodent and dog control is a possibility. Vaccines (killed or live attenuated promastigotes) have been tried but effectiveness has not been assessed.\n\nBlack Flies are small (1.5-4m in length) and normally black with short hairless legs and antennae. They have large compound eyes and a characteristically hairy humped thorax. Flies of the genusSimulium are generally found near free-flowing well-oxygenated water and bite during the day, tearing the skin to reach blood vessels.\n\nIllustration 12-11. Typical illustration of a Black Fly(Simulium). They are usually small (1.44m in length), black with short hairless legs and antennae.(SOURCE: PHIL 4639  CDC)\n\nSimuliidae eggs are laid in flowing or turbid waters in clusters of 200-800 eggs depending on the species. Hatching is mediated by the external environment, generally occurring several days following oviposition. There are 6-9 larval instars, with the larvae remaining essentially sedentary for the period and feeding through filtration. Movement is possible if necessary with some larval species acting as predators. The mature larvae can be recognized by a characteristic black gill spot on the thorax. The pupa is enclosed in a dark colored cocoon, identifiable by a series of filamentous respiratory gills protruding from the anterior end. In most cases the adult fly emerges from the pupal stage following one week of incubation.\n\nSimulium are vectors for the filarial parasitic nematode responsible for Onchocerciasis (Onchocerca volvulus). It is distributed throughout Africa, Arabia, Central America, northern South America and Mexico with 30 million people infected in Africa alone; it is one of the most important causes of blindness in the world. Adult worms (up to 50cm) live in the subcutaneous tissue of man (the only known host) and release microfilariae into the skin. These are taken up by Simulium (S. damnosum and S. naevei in Africa; S. ochraceum and S. metallicum in Central America). Microfilariae penetrate the gut wall, migrate to the thoracic muscles, molt to L stages and molt again to filariform L stages which are passed to the next host during a blood meal. Larvae mature to adults in one year and may live for up to 20 years. Microfilariae can live for up to two years but are often trapped, in fibrous nodules, by the hosts cellular response and are responsible for the pathology. Microfilariae are highly motile, unsheathed and measure 300 by 7 microns; there are no nuclei in the end of the tail, which is long and pointed; the head is slightly enlarged. Microfilariae are not found in blood.\n\nSkin problems include nodules (2cm to 5cm in diameter) containing adult worms. Onchodermatitis is caused by death of microfilariae in the skin and is associated with severe pruritis (adopts different forms in different geographical localities e.g. erysipelas de la costa in Central America, leopard skin in parts of Africa), skin depigmentation and premature ageing. There may be minor elephantiasis of the inguinal area (hanging groin) or of the genitals (including hydrocoele). Eye involvement is due to microfilariae entering the eye and dying and may eventually lead to blindness through sclerosing keratitis and retinal damage (microfilaria can be seen in the anterior chamber of the eye). There may be competition between parasite and host for vitamin A.\n\nIvermectin destroys microfilariae and renders adult female worms infertile; the manufacturer provides this drug without charge. Nodules may be surgically removed to reduce the worm-load and decrease the chances of ocular involvement. In areas of East Africa, S. naevei has been eradicated with insecticide (the larvae of this parasite attach to freshwater crabs). S. damnosum inhabit areas far distant to its breeding sites and control is much more difficult. However, the WHO larvicide program in concert with mass Ivermectin treatment has the potential to control the problem. Vegetation should be cleared around villages and irrigation should be devised to avoid fast-flowing water currents.\n\nChrysops are 9-10m in length with broad wings and large iridescent eyes. The abdomen is yellow or orange and can be patterned with black markings. The antennae consist of three segments, lacking a projection from the second segment and with the third segment subdivided into four smaller sections. Female Chrysops are attracted by smoke and normally bite in the morning or late afternoon. They breed in shaded muddy areas and have a worldwide distribution.\n\nImage 12-21. Image of a Deer fly receiving a blood meal. They have large iridescent eyes and broad wings. Generally measure between 910m in length. (SOURCE: University of Florida)\n\nFemale Tabanids generally lay 100 -1000 large creamy white eggs on the undersides of plants and rocks surrounding aquatic areas. The eggs hatch following several weeks of incubation. Larvae live and feed in wet rotting vegetation but survive breathing oxygen. The larval stage can be quite prolonged (1-3 years) with 6-13 larval instars depending on the species. The mature larvae migrate to dry areas and undergo pupation. The pupa often gets buried in the soil and can often be large. The pupal stage lasts several weeks, and the adults emerge to feed.\n\nTabanids are vectors for the parasitic nematode Loa loa. TheirMicrofilariae are large and sheathed and contain nuclei extending to the end of the rounded tail. Adult worms are thin and white (females 2cm-7cm long, 425m in diameter and males 2cm-3.4cm long, 350m in diameter). Clinical features of Loa loa infections include considerable pruritis and transient painful subcutaneous swellings termed Calabar swellings. Migrating adult worms can cross the conjunctiva or the bridge of the nose and ectopic worms cause problems such as hydrocoele, orchitis, colonic lesions, encephalitis.\n\nWorms traversing the conjunctiva may be removed surgically. Diethyl-carbamazine (DEC) is a proven treatment; prevention comprises the use of prophylactic DEC. However, DEC may have fatal side effects including encephalitis and the current drug of choice is Ivermectin. Drugs kill microfilariae but not adult worms. Antihistamines and corticosteroids may prevent allergic reactions brought about by rapid destruction of microfilariae in heavy infections. Insect control is not practical.\n\nIllustration 12-12: Typical Illustration of a Biting Midge(Culicoides). The thorax is often black spotted and contains a distinctive set of small depressions called the humeral pits just posterior of the head (SOURCE: PHIL 3822  CDC/Dr. Richard Darsie)\n\nFemale culicoides lay 30-250 dark, cylindrical eggs on the surface of wet soil or organic debris. Larvae emerge from the eggs soon thereafter depending on the environmental conditions. There are four larval instars, and the mature larvae resemble that of a nematode worm. They have a small dark head, 12 segments, and terminal papillae. The larvae feed on detritus and may development for extended periods of time depending on the species and conditions. The pupal period lasts 3-10 days, with the adult females emerging to feed and breed.\n\nPediculus humanus capitis (the head louse) and Pediculus humanus humanus (the body louse) are 2m-4m long and flattened dorsoventrally. They are wingless with distinct head, thorax (bearing three pairs of clawed legs) and abdomen (seven segments). The fore legs are well developed to grasp clothing and hair, with terminal claws to aid grip on the host. Pediculus feed using two stylets which suck blood whilst a third directs saliva into the skin; meanwhile feces are continually passed onto the skin.\n\nImage 12-22. DorsalImage of a typical body louse (Pediculus humanus humanus). They are wingless and dorsoventrally flattened, bearing a distinct head, thorax and abdomen. They measure approximately 24m in length. (SOURCE: PHIL 9205  CDC/ Frank Collins, Ph.D.)\n\nThe head and body louse share very similar life cycles only differing in the placement of their eggs; the body louse cements eggs to clothing and the head louse cements single eggs at the base of hairs. Females can lay upwards of 300 eggs during a lifetime. Lice have a hemimetabolous lifecycle. The nymph hatches from the egg and appears very structurally similar to the adult louse. There are three nymphal instars that require blood meals to proceed. It only takes 7-12 days to proceed to the adult stage if blood meals are readily available, but conversely lice will perish if not fed for several days.\n\nColonization by lice may result in serious infection and disease. Lice can potentially pass Rickettsia prowazeki resulting in epidemic typhus and other pathogens such as Rochalimaea quintana andBorrelia recurrentis that result in potentially serious fever. The mode of transmission for all infectious agents is through physically crushing and spreading feces or waste into the wound created through feeding.\n\nThe most effective control is to remain clean, but insecticides are often necessary during epidemics to avoid reinfestation.\n\nThe crab louse is 1m-2m long and distinguished by a square, undifferentiated body and massive claws on the two posterior sets of forelegs. These claws are able to grasp both pubic and facial hair (including eyelashes), and allow the louse to remain tightly bound to the host. They are spread mostly by sexual contact, but may also be transmitted through fomites.\n\nThe life cycle of Phthirus is very similar to Pediculus. Females lay bundles of eggs on the coarse pubic hairs and dense facial hairs of humans. The crab lice proceed through a cycle similar to the head and body lice, with the nymphal stage proceeding several days longer. Phthirus are less active than Pediculus, but similarly can not survive for very long without a host and blood meals.\n\nImage 12-24. VentralImage of a typical Crab louse (Phthirus). They hold onto pubic hair with the large claws found on the posterior legs.(SOURCE: PHIL 4077  CDC)\n\nThere appears to be very little evidence of disease transmission by Phthirus, but have the ability to cause severe localized allergic reactions during infestations.\n\nFleas are laterally compressed and wingless (1m-4m) with powerful legs. The entire body is generally covered with bristles, and the mouthparts point downwards. Pulex irritans (the human flea) andXenopsylla cheopsis (the tropical rat flea) are combless. Nosopsyllus fasciatus (the rat flea) has a pronotal comb (behind its head). Ctenocephalides felis (the cat flea) and C. canis have two combs  a pronotal comb and a genal comb (under the head).\n\nImage 12-25. Image of the cat flea Ctenocephalides felis. Fleas are laterally compressed and wingless (1-4 m) with powerful legs. (SOURCE: CDC)\n\nTunga penetrans (the Chigoe or jigger flea) demonstrates compressed thoracic segments and attacks man in the Americas, Africa and India, commonly penetrating the stratum corneum between the toes or in the toenail margins\n\nImage 12-26. Image of the Chigoe flea Tunga penetrans. They commonly penetrate between the toes or under the toenail. (SOURCE: Unknown)\n\nFlea larvae hatch from eggs generally following a week incubation. The larvae are legless, segmented, and covered with setae. The larvae feed on organic material, and proceed through two or three larval instars depending on the environment. The larva spins a cocoon and pupates and emerges when the conditions appear favorable for survival. The life cycle can be as short as several weeks or up to several years depending on the stimuli surrounding the pupa. Both sexes take blood meals can live for long periods of time allowing females to lay an enormous number of eggs over their lifetime.\n\nFleas are a general nuisance, often biting humans on exposed surfaces resulting in discomfort. Flea-bites induce pruritic papular urticaria commonly on the unprotected lower leg of women and all over the body of children who have intimate animal contact; a generalized allergic response may occur.\n\nCertain fleas, notably the rat fleas, spread plague (Yersinia pestis) and murine typhus (Rickettsia typhi), and serve as intermediate hosts for species of tapeworm (Hymenolepis sp.). Cat and dog fleas serve as intermediate hosts for another common tapeworm (Dipylidium caninum), which can be spread to humans, especially children with exposure to pet animals. Pulex irritans is not a major vector of disease but may play a minor role in the transmission of plague. Infection is often spread by the bite alone, but can also potential be transmitted through fecal abrasion. Tunga penetrans does not transmit disease to humans, but females will burrow into host skin. The pinpoint lesion enlarges to pea-size within two weeks necessitating removal of the gravid female using a pin, a needle or a sliver of bamboo. This may potentially lead to a secondary bacterial infection.\n\nControl of fleas is generally mediated through insecticidal powders and aerosols. If outbreaks of murine typhus or plague occur steps to control the rodent populations in the affected area may be employed.\n\nCommon bedbugs (Cimex lectularius) are 3m-7m long, wingless, and flattened dorsoventrally. They have long legs, clearly segmented antennae and abdomen, and a distinctive set of compound eyes.Bedbugs are characteristically pale brown but swell and turn to black-red when engorged with blood. Both sexes infest clothing, beds and laundry and pierce the skin with an elongated proboscis to feed.\n\nImage 12-27. Image of the common Bedbug Cimex lectularius. Bed bugs are usually pale brown in color but swell and turn black-red after a blood meal. (SOURCE: PHIL 6283  CDC/ Donated by the World Health Organization, Geneva, Switzerland.)\n\nCimex nymphs appear yellow and very similar structurally to the adults. The life cycle is hemimetabolous with five nymphal instars that require blood meals to proceed. The adults primarily feed nocturnally, and females may lay upwards of 500 eggs during their lifetime. Life cycle duration and the number of offspring produced are primarily determined by the humidity and temperature of the surrounding environment.\n\nCimex blood meals result in inflammation, irritation and intense itching. These are the most common results of an infestation, but Cimex have also been found to carry Hepatitis B in India.\n\nA female lays around 200 adherent eggs at the rate of 3 or 4 per day: eggs are white and 1mm in length. Control is by application of insecticide to mattresses and crevices where they hide during the daytime (to a height of several feet from the floor).\n\nTriatomine bugs (a.k.a., Assassin bugs, Kissing bugs, Cone-nosed beetles, Walapai Tiger, or Reduviid bugs) are of variable size but are often large (10 -30mm). They typically appear brown-black, but can have bright coloration. They are distinguished by a large snout with dark compound eyes, a thin and straight proboscis, and a triangular pronotum. They have long slender legs with terminal claws and segmented antennae. A set of large wings covers the oval abdomen. They live in the mud-walls of housing and woodpiles and come out to feed at night when the host is asleep: they are voracious biters, often on the face around the eyes.\n\nImage 12-28. Image of the Triatomine Bugs Triatoma infestans. Reduviid bugs are of variable size but are often large (10-30 mm). They typically appear brown-black, but can have bright coloration. (SOURCE: PHIL 2538  CDC/World Health Organization.)\n\nThe life cycle of Triatoma is hemimetabolous. The emergence of nymphs from eggs is primarily determined by the environment, and blood meals are required to proceed through the five nymphal instars. The nymphs and adults feed nocturnally and generally lay 50 to 1000 eggs depending on life term and the quantity of blood meals taken.\n\nThe primary disease transmitted by Triatoma is Chagas Disease caused by Trypanosoma cruzi. Chagas disease is endemic in 21 countries; around 100 million people in Central and South America could be exposed to reduviid bugs; the prevalence of Chagas disease is about 16-18 million. Rural migrations to urban areas during the 1970s and 1980s changed the traditional epidemiological pattern of Chagas disease: it became an urban disease, as unscreened blood transfusion created a second way of transmission. Between 1960 and 1989, the prevalence of infected blood in blood banks in selected cities of South America ranged from 1.7% in Sao Paulo, Brazil to 53% in Santa Cruz, Bolivia, a percentage far higher than that of hepatitis or HIV infection (WHO data).\n\nTriatomids are blood feeders and deposit infected feces (containing metacyclic trypanomastigotes) on the hosts skin during feeding. The host rubs the feces into the wound; alternatively trypanosomes enter through the mucous membranes or conjunctivae. Once in the bloodstream, trypanomastigotes penetrate the spleen, liver, lymph nodes and muscle by an unknown mechanism (possibly via receptor-ligand binding proteins). The parasite transforms to the amastigote form that divides by binary fission and forms a pseudocyst. This ruptures and released amastigotes transform to flagellated trypanomastigotes via promastigotes and epimastigotes and enter the bloodstream. Unlike African bloodstream trypomastigotes, these do not replicate. If a Reduviid bug eats trypanomastigotes, they transform to epimastigotes, replicate by binary fission, and are passed as trypanomastigotes two weeks later. Trypanosoma cruzi does not exhibit antigenic variation but can persist for the life of the host. T. cruzi may also be transmitted in blood products or transplacentally. Humans and a large number of species of domestic and wild animals constitute the reservoir, and the vector bugs infest poor housing and thatched roofs.\n\nIn the acute phase (generally seen in children) a small red nodule (Chagoma) may form at the site of the bite. Romanas signs comprise fever, unilateral bipalpebral edema and ophthalmia. Most acute phases are asymptomatic and resolve to an asymptomatic chronic stage in 2-3 months. However, the patient may present with myalgia, bone pain, fever and chills, lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly and anorexia. Young children may develop meningoencephalitis. Pseudocysts form in heart muscle and fatal heart failure arises within one month. Neurological disorders, gastrointestinal disease and chronic myocarditis are features of chronic disease (mainly seen in adults) which arises 10-20 years after the initial infection and is untreatable. Congenital infection may lead to abortion, still birth or acute disease. Reactivation occurs in HIV-infected patients. Diagnosis is by detection of trypanosomes in peripheral anti-coagulated blood, CSF or node aspirate using wet film or Giemsa stain (acute disease) or by serology (Chagas IgG ELISA in chronic disease). Trypanosoma cruzi is usually C-shaped, 12-30m in length with a narrow membrane and a flagellum. The posterior kinetoplast is characteristically large and the nucleus is central.\n\nThere is no satisfactory treatment. Extended therapy with the toxic agents, benznidazole or nifurtimox, only kills extra-cellular parasites and optimum efficacy (60%) is achieved during the acute phase. Chronic disease is treated symptomatically. Control is by improvements in housing, health education and insecticidal treatment of dwellings. Vaccines and chemoprophylaxis are ineffective (associated with autoimmune disease). For the control of blood-transmitted infections the aim is to screen all blood donors from endemic countries for T. cruzi antibodies, and to strengthen health service infrastructures for multiple blood screening (HIV, Hepatitis B and T. cruzi).\n\nTRYPANOSOMA CRUZI ()\n\n Trypanosoma cruzi causes Chagas disease (), a zoonotic disease that can be transmitted to humans by blood-sucking reduviid bugs (). Chagas disease (South American trypansomiasis) is commonly seen in the countries of South America.\n\nMORPHOLOGY AND LIFE CYCLE\n\n Three forms exist in T. cruzi life cycle. In man and other vertebrate host, T. cruzi exists amastigotes and non-multiplying trypomastigotes; the insect form includes epimastigotes and multiplying trypomastigotes.\n\n Amastigote (): It is the non-flagellated, intracellular parasite found in man and other vertebrate host. Amastigote is a round or oval body measuring 2 to 4m in diameter. It has a nucleus, kinetoplast and an axoneme. Morphologically it resembles the amastigote of Leishmania species; hence it is frequently called as leishmanial form. It multiplies in man in this stage only.\n\n Trypanomastigote ()Fig --2: It is the flagellated form and has two types. The multiplying forms are found in the stomach of reduviid bug and in the culture, and non-multiplying forms are found in the blood in man and other mammalian hosts.\n\n\n\n Trypanomastigotes are usually C-shaped and slender, 11.7-30.4m in lengths and 0.7-5.9m in breadth. The posterior end is wedge-shaped. At the anterior end, a free flagellum originates and traverses on surface of the parasite as a narrow undulating membrane. They have a centrally placed prominent nucleus and a large round to oval kinetoplast at the posterior end.\n\n T. cruzi need two hosts to complete its life cycle. The vertebrate hosts are man and other reservoir hosts, the insect host Reduviid bug (kissing bug, so named because they often feed around the lips of sleeping people).\n\n When an infected triatomine () insect vector (or kissing bug) takes a blood meal and releases trypomastigotes in its feces near the site of the bite wound, Trypomastigotes enter the host through the wound or through intact mucosal membranes, such as the conjunctiva (). Common triatomine vector species for trypanosomiasis belong to the genera Triatoma, Rhodinius, and Panstrongylus. Inside the host, the trypomastigotes invade cells, where they differentiate into intracellular amastigotes. The amastigotes multiply by binary fission and differentiate into trypomastigotes, and then are released into the circulation as bloodstream trypomastigotes. Trypomastigotes infect cells from a variety of tissues and transform into intracellular amastigotes in new infection sites. Clinical manifestations can result from this infective cycle. The bloodstream trypomastigotes do not replicate (different from the African trypanosomes). Replication resumes only when the parasites enter another cell or are ingested by another vector. Feeding on human or animal blood that contains circulating parasites infects the kissing bug. The ingested trypomastigotes transform into epimastigotes in the vectors midgut. The parasites multiply and differentiate in the midgut and differentiate into infective metacyclic trypomastigotes in the hindgut. Within 8-10 days, these trypanomastigotes are excreted in the faeces of the bug, as the bug takes the blood meal from a host and the cycle is continued. Trypanosoma cruzi can also be transmitted through blood transfusions, organ transplantation, transplacentally, and in laboratory accidents.\n\nPATHOGENESIS AND SYMPTOMS\n\n The pathogenesis of acute Chagas disease depends upon the destruction of parasitised and non-parasitised host cells. Destruction of host cells is responsible for the clinical symptoms of the disease at the early stage. Chagas disease is a chronic condition. Infected persons may show few, if any, signs of disease and may survive for decades, even though still infected.\n\n Acute Chagas disease\n\n It occurs most commonly in infants and children. The first sign of illness occurs at least 1 week after invasion by the parasites.\n\n A local lesion (chagoma, palpebral edema) can appear at the site of inoculation. Chagoma () is localized swelling of the skin and contains intracellular amastigotes in leucocytes and subcutaneous. When the parasite is inoculated in the conjunctiva, a unilateral painless oedema of the palpebral and perioccular tissue develops in the eye. It is called Romanas sign and is the classical finding in the acute Chagas disease. The acute phase is usually asymptomatic, but presents with manifestations that include fever, anorexia, lymphadenopathy, and mild hepatosplenomegaly; in severe infection, myocarditis may develop. Most deaths in acute Chagas disease are due to heart failure or meningoencephalitis. The acute stage lasts for 20-30 days. Symptoms resolve in most of the patients, who then enter into asymptomatic or indeterminate stage of T. cruzi.\n\n Chronic Chagas disease\n\n It is seen in older children and adults between 20-40 years of age. The symptomatic chronic stage may not occur for years or even decades after initial infection; it may also be seen in persons without any previous episode of acute disease. Its manifestations include cardiomyopathy () (the most serious manifestation), pathologies of the digestive tract such as megaesophagus and megacolon, and weight loss. Chronic Chagas disease and its complications can be fatal.\n\n During the chronic phase, although signs may not be apparent, the repeated cycle of intracellular multiplication are continually destroying cells, not only those in which the amastigotes multiply, but also neighbouring cells. An autoimmune mechanism is probably involved. Neurons are particularly vulnerable to destruction. If the intracellular groups of parasite (pseudocysts) are concentrated in parts of gastrointes\n\ntinal tract, especially in oesophagus or colon, peristalsis may be interfered and the organ may become hugely distended. This condition is indicated by the prefix mega, for example megaoesophagus () or megacolon (). The unfortunate patient may be unable to swallow and die of starvation. Megacolon may become so gross leading to rupture of colon and death..\n\n If the pseudocysts congregate in the heart muscle, and some strains are more prone to do this than others, the ensuing neuronal and muscle destruction may gravely weaken the heart wall, causing irreversible damage and leading to an early death from heart attack.\n\nDIAGNOSIS\n\n The diagnostic procedure in acute Chagas disease is to demonstrate the causal agent. It can be achieved by:\n\n Microscopic examinations: a) of fresh anticoagulated blood, or its buffy coat, for motile parasites; and b) of thin and thick blood smears stained with Giemsa, for visualization of parasites.\n\n Isolation of the agent by: a) inoculation into mice; b) culture in specialized media (e.g. NNN, LIT); and c) xenodiagnosis (), where uninfected reduviid bugs are fed on the patients blood, and their gut contents examined for parasites 4 weeks later.\n\n Immunological diagnosis: During the chronic stage of infection, parasites are rare or absent from the circulation; immunodiagnosis is the method of choice for determining whether the patient is infected. Although IFA is very sensitive, cross-reactivity occurs with sera from patients with leishmaniasis, a protozoan disease that occurs in the same geographical areas as T. cruzi. Sensitivity and specificity of EIA tests that use crude antigens are similar to those of the IFA test. Although differentiating between acute and chronic infection is very important in determining therapy, serology cannot be used to do so. A positive titer indicates only infection at some unknown time, and not acute infection.\n\nEPIDEMOLOGY\n\n Chagas disease is a zoonoses. The infection is transmitted from animals to man. It is distributed in the Americas from the southern United States to southern Argentina, mostly in poor, rural areas of Central and South America. Chronic Chagas disease is a major health problem in many Latin American countries. With increased population movements, the possibility of transmission by blood transfusion has become more substantial in the United States.\n\n Two major cycles of transmission of infection take place: domestic cycle and sylvatic () cycle. In domestic cycle, the infection is transmitted between man and domestic animals by the bite of blood sucking reduviid bugs. Naturally infected dog, bug and rabbit are the reservoir hosts. They are the sources of infection of man. This type of infection is common in rural areas with low socio-economic condition and poor sanitation.\n\n In sylvatic cycle, the infection is transmitted between sylvatic reduviid bugs and small mammals including rodents and marsupials. These are the reservoirs and source of infection for man. Chagas disease is transmitted commonly by kissing bugs. Less frequently, the disease may be transmitted by blood transfusion or congenital infection, and laboratory infection.\n\nPREVENTION AND CONTROL\n\n 1) Treatment: Medication for Chagas disease is usually effective when given during the acute stage of infection. The drugs of choice are benznidazole or nifurtimox (under an investigational New Drug Protocol from the CDC Drug Service). Once the disease has progressed to later stages, no medication has been proven to be effective. In the chronic stage, the treatment involves managing symptoms associated with the disease.\n\n Acute Chagas disease must be treated early. The decision for initiating therapy must not be swayed by negative findings or delayed while waiting for results of isolation attempts, if the clinical and epidemiologic suspicion of the disease is strong.\n\n 2) The preventive measures include: a) application of insecticides to kill the vector bugs in human dwellings and improvement of rural housing environment to eliminate the breeding places of kissing bug, b) Personal protection by using mosquito nets and insect repellants, and c) Serological screening of blood donors for T. cruzi to prevent transmission by blood transfusion.\n\nPoisonous snakes, spiders & bugs whilst on vacation in Mexico and the Caribbean.\n\nMexico, home to venomous killer caterpillars, poisonous spiders, fatal tsetse fly, blood sucking deer ticks and the ancient Aztecs. Mexico is an adorable place, absolutely beautiful, with world class hotels and superb beaches providing fantastic cheap vacations.\n\nBut Mexico is full of poisonous insects and snakes in virtually every place you could go to, killing hundreds of people every year, and infecting thousands more, including tourists. When in Mexico, or any other foreign country, please remember to pack anit-histamine tablets, these will help if you are ever bitten, and if someone you know has been bitten by a snake, never suck out the poison.\n\nThe Brown Recluse Spider, or the Violin Spider, are very small and grow between 6-20mm in size, but they can pack a huge punch. They like undisturbed placed like garages, and wood or rock piles, but are frequently found in the house behind wardrobes, in clothes or linen piles, cupboards and under beds. They are nocturnal creatures and if the male goes hunting at night, it can often be found in temporary cover, like footwear or drawers.\n\nVenomous Brown Recluse Spiders are not aggressive, but when they feel threatened, they will attack. Most of the bites from these spiders go by unnoticed, which is where the danger lies. Many of these bites will come to nothing more than a bit of itching and swelling, whereas some, as you can see by the picture above, are a bit more serious. Once a Brown Recluse Spider bites someone, the venom will be throughout their blood system in minutes, but still giving them time to seek medical attention before serious internal injuries can happen.\n\nMost fatalities occur in younger children up to the age of seven, or the elderly or anyone with an insufficient immune system, even a cold or illness can cause these bites to turn into something deadly. If bitten, symptoms may include vomiting, rashes, fever and joint pain, which may lead to coma and death. Seek medical attention immediately if anybody has been bitten.\n\nThis is Mexicos most venomous spider. Whilst on vacation or on holiday to Mexico, ensure to check clothes before they are worn.\n\nThe 700 islands of the Bahamas and Jamaica are a tropical paradise. The venomous spider named the Brown Recluse Spider is a vicious yet still shy creature. The above picture shows a venomous bite from this spider which has been left untreated.\n\nThe Caribbean Brown Recluse Spider is shy, but packs a powerful punch. They are found in cupboards, under beds, and within towels on shelves. They usually bite when someone inadvertently puts on their clothes with the spider nestled inside. The venom is more toxic that a rattle snakes bite. Cheap vacations in the Bahamas can turn into a deadly battle for life with tropical spider bites.\n\nThis venomous spider can be found throughout the Bahamas and Jamaica. Also known as the Violin Spider, this creature is only approximately 1cm  2.5cm in size. The initial bite may not be noticed by the victim as the bite is so small. Not all bites will be poisonous, but you never can tell.\n\nThe poison is hemotoxin, which actually destroys soft tissue. The bites become itchy within 1  8 hours, then after 12 hours pain will begin to develop along with redness and possible swelling of the bitten area. Over the next few days skin lesions will develop and can grow to over 25 cm in diameter. The wound can become gangrenous with the possibility of a limb being amputated. These wounds are painful and may take over a year to heal.\n\nIf at any time you think you may of been bitten by a spider, seek medical attention. Do not take chances not only can your Jamaican vacation be ruined, but your life could change completely.\n\nThe adorable puss caterpillar goes by many different names, such as the Tree Asp, Southern Flannel Moth, Pussy Moth, and the Asp Caterpillar. And this moth, is only dangerous in its caterpillar stage. The caterpillar is covered in tiny reddish hairs, and all these are attached to venom glands, and once anything comes into contact with the very sharp hairs, they are injected with venom.\n\nSymptoms of caterpillar hair poisoning are nausea, rashes, blisters, abdominal pains, swelling, burning sensations, numbness, chest pains, difficulty in breathing and death. If injected by these furry critters, get help immediately, stop for nothing, your life may depend on it.\n\nMany vacations to Mexico have been ruined when children pick up these caterpillars to play with.\n\nThe Deer Tick, sounds like a normal little animal tick which obviously is attracted to animals, and you would be right, BUT..it does bite humans. If a tic bites a person, 99% of the time, they do not notice the initial bite, and the tic can stay on the body, drinking your blood, for nearly four days, before it falls off, full.\n\nThe Deer Tic can give its host Lyme Disease, and the initial symptoms of this are headache and fevers, and as time goes by, stiff joints and heart problems, possibly leading to death. If bitten, or even if you suspect a bite, see a doctor, if not treated quickly, the bitten person can suffer with these medical problems for years.\n\nThe Assassin Bug has over thirty different names, but the disease they carry, Chagas Disease, is still the same. It is estimated the nearly eleven million people in Mexico have this potentially fatal disease, but do not yet know it, similar to Mesothelioma ( Asbestos Poisoning ) this disease will stay with you for life, and it may only show itself after twenty to thirty years after the initial bite. Vacations to Mexico are fantastic, but not worth thirty years of pain.\n\nThere are several species of this bug, some with bites that you will feel instantly, and some with bites that you will never notice. One of the names of this bug is the Kissing Bug, because they will bite their victims at night around the nose and mouth area, many people who have felt the bite in the dark have mistook it for a mosquito bite.\n\nInitial bites can be cured with medicines, with a 90% cure rate, if the bite goes untreated, after four weeks then you will be 80% likely to have Chagas Disease for the rest of your life. 40% of these people will develop heart and digestive problems later on in life, with the cause being constantly misdiagnosed. If bitten by anything whilst on holidays to Mexico, seek medical advice, no matter how trivial it may seem.\n\nMexico is home to over 60 different species of Coral Snakes, all venomous, all bite, some can kill.Coral snakes are regarded as one of the top five most poisonous snakes in the world, killing many people annually, especially in South America and Mexico. Their colors vary, but many have a distinct three colour pattern.\n\nIn Mexico, they are called the twenty minute snake, because after you have been bitten, you will be dead within twenty minutes.\n\nMost of these snakes are very small, some about 20cm, but some can grow to 150 cm ( 5 feet ), the venom from the Coral Snake is a neurotoxin, and will immediately begin to attack your breathing systems, and medical attention needs to be given very quickly. Anti venom is available but artificial respiration may be required to save the life. If a person is bitten whilst on vacation to Mexico and becomes unconscious, continue with artificial respiration until medical help arrives, do not stop, their life depends on it.\n\nFree Link: WARNING: The Screw Worm Fly is a deadly and dangerous tissue eating maggot. It kills herds of cattle, sheep and people. It is now known to be in Mexico, Jamaica, and Panama. It is on Americas most wanted list for deadly insects. Follow the free link to our sister site for more information.\n\nThere are many vacation packages and holiday deals to Mexico online. Prior to leaving, ensure about inoculations for everyone.\n\nCaribbean vacations and holidays may never be the same again. There are many venomous spiders and poisonous snakes in and around the beautiful Bahamas islands. Deadly biting insects await the careless traveller, whose vacation could transform into a nightmare. The tropical weather of Jamaica and the Bahamas make these places an ideal breeding ground for some of the worlds deadliest creatures.\n\nVenomous snakes and venomous poisonous can kill. Here are some of the scary and potentially dangerous creatures that await you on your Bahamas vacations.\n\nThe Caribbean poisonous spiders known as the Banana Spiders or the Brazilian Wandering Spiders are lethal. The Guinness book of records has them listed as the most venomous spider in the world. They are nocturnal spiders whom forage through the undergrowth at night for food. They reside is moist places such as under logs, in rock piles or cellars, and are usually found close to human habitats. This is the spider which has ruined many vacations in the Caribbean.\n\nThe neurotoxin from the Banana Spider can cause pain during an erection and can lead to impotency. The initial bite will be painful, and swelling and reddening around the bite mark will happen in minutes. Muscle spasms will follow shortly afterwards, intense pain will rack the body as the venom begins to flow through the blood system. Paralysis will begin to take hold as the venom attacks the respiratory system. This leads to asphyxiation then a painful and slow death.\n\nThis all only takes from as little as two hours. If anyone has been bitten by this beautiful yet very deadly creature, run like the wind to the nearest medical station, your life depends on it. Caribbean vacations are out of this world and can blow your mind, just take care with any insect bite that you may recive.\n\nPoisonous snakes have never really been a problem in the Caribbean. Occasionally a tourist on vacation may be bitten by a non-venomous snake. The sighting of the odd Fer-de-lance or Lance Head snake may be a bit worrying though.\n\nThe fer-de-lance snake has hemotoxin venom, which can cause nausea, loss of weight, black outs, loss of memory and even temporary paralysis. Treatments for this snake bite are readily available, although there have been no reports of a person being bitten by one of these in the Caribbean for years.\n\nThere are only a few islands which do have land snakes on them, St. Lucia, Martinque, Guadaloupe, and Trinidad are the reportedly the only islands. The snakes on these islands are not meant to pose a threat to tourists at all. Do not believe what you see in the movies, not all snakes hunt humans on vacation as a quick snack,\n\nThere are many species of brightly colored poisonous frogs in the Caribbean and Jamaica areas. The Poison Dart Frog, or Poison Arrow Frog, only measures approximately 1.5 cm, but carries enough toxin on its skin to kill twenty men, or at least 10,000 mice. Poisonous frogs present no immediate threat to humans, unless they are touched, which whilst on vacation in the Caribbean, some tourists have been known to stroke these deadly creatures, not realizing the potential danger.\n\nVenomous frogs secrete poisons onto their skin to deter predators. It is said that the poisons are taken from the millipedes and other insects that they eat, as the frogs cannot produce their own poisons. Medically, one of the toxins they produce can be used as a painkiller and is said to be more than 200 times more potent than morphine.\n\nThe Poison Dart Frog was used by natives on their spear heads to poison and kill their quarry. If you touch one of these frogs accidentally, quickly hop to the nearest medical centre for help. These frogs can kill, so do not take it lightly. Be careful if on vacation with young children, the bright coloring often temps children to pick up these frogs.\n\nThis is a very big, scary, and dangerous centipede. This massive centipede reaches an amazing 29 cm in length, that is nearly 1 foot long. This meat eating monster eats tarantula spiders, birds, lizards and even bats. The fast moving centipede is able to outrun a small child and is found more usually in Jamaica.\n\nThe venom of this impressive beast is delivered through two modified claws from around the head. The young of this poisonous animal are black with red heads. The extremely potent venom will cause severe itching, redness and extreme swelling. Chills and sweating will follow soon afterwards and a weakness will overcome the victim. Fatalities are rare from this over sized insect, but they are scary and will deliver a vacation wrecking bite. People on vacation in the Caribbean often leave their brains at home and become careless, it is at this time that most bites happen.\n\nThis is a deadly snail which can kill humans. The chances of being hunted down and killed by this timid beast are very rare. But it has been known to kill through infections. The snail is described as a pest as it devastates crops and the USA has began exterminating it where ever it shows up in America. Just one of these snails in an area will produce a total colony of thousands within a year.\n\nThe Giant African Land Snail carries at least eight different parasites which can infect animals and humans. The major known disease they carry is rabies, which is carried in the snails dung. Dogs have died from eating a sing snail. The dung left behind if touched by human hands can transmit rabies.\n\nThe land snails can grow up to 7cm tall and over 20cm in length and the shell is conical shaped. Some nations keep them as pets whilst others use them as a food source. This slimey creature should not ruin a fantastic vacation to the Caribben, but steer clear of them just in case.\n\nThis may be the devil re-incarnated. This little demon is neither venomous nor poisonous. There are five types of screw worm, and only one type flies. The maggots from this flying insect are the actual screw worm, and they eat living flesh, not like normal maggots which only eat the dead flesh.\n\nThe female Screwworm will lay 3000 eggs within her life cycle, which is only 20 days. These maggots are usually laid in an open wound, no matter how small, in the navel of new born animals and humans. The maggots hatch within hours and begin to burrow into the soft flesh as they eat their way into the body. If a person scratches the wound, the maggots screw deeper. These maggots cause many deaths.\n\nIn 1998, a woman came back from a vacation in Trinidad and complained to her doctor within days about vomiting and headaches. After an x ray, 94 of these maggots were taken from inside the back of her neck. They had apparently entered through a mosquito bite. If they were not removed, they would have killed the woman by eating into her brain.\n\nIf you have been to the Caribbean on vacation and suffer from abnormal headaches or pain in areas where a wound ( even the smallest bite form a mosquito ) has occurred, go to the hospital for an ex-ray.\n\nSouth America used to be infested with the screw worm, it killed herds of cattle, sheep, and many people. An idea was launched to infiltrate the screw worm population with specially bred infertile screw worm adult flies. This would reduce the number of pregnant screw worms whislt they mate, which is between 4 -5 times in their 20 day life. Billions of these infertile adult screw worms were bred and released into the air. It worked.\n\nSouth America is now free from this pest, Mexico, Jamaica and other places are not. Factories in South America produce billions of these adult screw worm flies every year to eradicate this demon of a pest. They are exported to other parts of the world as the eradication process of a very dangerous creature progresses.\n\nDo not underestimate this creature. The screw worm is on Americas most wanted list. If this insect is suspected of being alive or infecting animals or humans on American soil. the authorities at the highest levels are notified and actions are implemented within hours. Be warned, it is dangerous and will kill without mercy.\n\nThe maggots are only under the skin for five days, if they do not leave the skin as they should do within five days, there is little hope for a person with a minimum of 250 flesh eating maggots crawling under the skin. Even cheap vacations in the Caribbean can resort in death if a person is not careful.\n\nFollow this free link to a sister presentation to discover the insect that kills over 3000 people each day, and is rife around the Caribbean.

This simply isnt the case  unless, of course, that individual is a member of a Nielsen family.\n\nThe Nielsen Company gathers data to determine the ratings of television programs, and while the company employs a variety of methods to collect their data (especially in this relatively new age of Internet streaming), the most common method is via Nielsen families.\n\nAll the links in Encyclopedic.co.uk stories are in RED with a Square and arrow, follow the links if you need to get more information, All our stories have all the links back to the original source, we also have other versions of the story on our website, Search our site using the link to the top left, check them all so you can decide what is the truth or copy and paste some words into google and get even more sources.\n\nNielsen households are randomly selected as a representative sample of the TV-viewing population of the United States:\n\nIts a very select few, explains Jon Gibs, Nielsens senior vice president for analytics and insights. The reason these people are picked is because they are representative of a broader population. The company goes to great lengths to make sure that each household chosen to be among the 25,000 Nielsen households stands for a large number of other people. We make sure that our TV households maintain what wed consider sort of normal behavior, and people are warned against changing their viewing habits just to make a particular show popular.\n\nSince Nielsen uses these selected families to determine television ratings, the viewing habits of most people (who are not members of a Nielsen family) go largely unrecorded.\n\n(Q): Is there an effective way to support my favorite shows? I rarely watch the traditional way anymore, what with DVR, streaming, iTunes, and a public library with a good DVD collection. So when networks are looking at numbers to decide the fate of a show, what do they take into consideration? Tweets? Emails? Purchases? App views? Hulu? Amount of GIFs on Tumblr? Do we now live in a world where Firefly could have been saved? Does my vote count? Annie (A): The short answer is no. And the long answer is nooooooooo, your TV vote doesnt count in any meaningful way unless youre a Nielsen family, in which case you affect ratings. And ratings are what count. The various fan ephemera does not have a big or clear impact on keep/cancel decisions.\n\nAs of August 2016, there were about 40,000 Nielsen households, representing a total of 118.4 million TV-viewing households, in the United States.Steve Krakauer added more detail about how Nielsen ratings were determined in a 2015 post onAutonomous:\n\nThe households are evenly distributed by population throughout the United States, and are roughly meant to be representative of the population as a whole. They also rotate occasionally. But lets get back to that number. Maybe 50,000 households seems like a lot to you, but to put it in perspective, there are approximately 100 million households with a TV in the United States. That means even at the high estimate of 50,000 households, the number represents.05% of the households. That would be less than 1/10 of 1%. The ratings that you seefor cable news, for broadcast primetime shows, etcare then extrapolated out from these Nielsen households. So in this scenario, each household represents 2,000 other households in approximating what the country is watching.\n\nAs Nielsens data is largely drawn from these Nielsen families, a non-Nielsen family members individual viewing (or lack thereof) of Donald Trumps inauguration would have virtually no impact on the events overall television ratings.\n\nBeware of other sites you have never heard of giving you news, a lot of them are just wanting to feed you multiple popup adverts and malware Visit us on facebook athttps://www.facebook.com/notinthemainstreamnews/\n\nWe use all our content under fair use to compare who is Fake and who is not, we do not claim ownership at all, all stories are published by the owners as FREE RSS Feeds.','2017-03-25 03:51:15'),(759,99,'fb2b7440161d0c213f2d4974fdeb4868660ea84d605ee3e76aafc160c2a888d7','f3e540b1446e4e62b7a867549c85928e','','','Outline:\n\n Urgent message circulating via social media claims that a new very white and shiny type of paracetamol tablets labelled P/500 contains the dangerous Machupo virus.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n Brief Analysis:\n\n The claims in the warning are utter nonsense.

Supposedly, doctors have found that this type ofparacetamol contains the Machupo virus. According to the message,Machupo is one of the most dangerous viruses in the world and has a high mortality rate. The message asks you to share the information with others in the hope of saving lives.\n\nThankfully, however, the claims in the message are utter nonsense.\n\nThere are no credible news or health authority reports about such a paracetamol contamination. Nor have there been any officialrecalls of the supposedly contaminatedmedication. Of course, if the dangerous contamination describedin the message was really taking place, there would be widespread news and media coverage of the incident along with official health warnings to consumers. And, of course, any contaminated products would have been removed from store shelves as the result of an official recall. The complete absence of any official news or government reports about the alleged contamination is enough, of itself, to reveal the warning message as a hoax.\n\nMoreover, the Machupo virus is spread primarily viaaerosol transmission of dust particles from the faeces and urine of infected rodents. And, although viruses likeMachupomay survive for up to two weeks in blood specimens outside the host, it cannot survive in dry environments. Thus, it would seemextremely unlikely that the virus could somehow survive the manufacturing process of theparacetamol tablets and weeks or months of subsequent storage in shops and home medicine cabinets.\n\nIf the claims in the message were true, then, presumably, there would have been a recent spike in reported cases. But, I could find no information aboutsuch a spike. In fact, it appears that there have been no reported human cases for several years.\n\nIn short, this supposed warning is just one more variant in a long line of false and misleading contamination hoaxes that have circulated the Internet in various forms for many years. Sharing these false messages helps nobody. Sharing serves only to spread misinformation and needlessly cause fear and alarm.\n\nReferences\n\n Panadol Toxic To Body Warning Message\n\n Bananas Injected With HIV Hoax Warning\n\n HOAX  Cool Drink Contaminated With Ebola Virus\n\n MACHUPO VIRUS','2017-03-25 03:51:15'),(760,99,'fb2b7440161d0c213f2d4974fdeb4868660ea84d605ee3e76aafc160c2a888d7','2bb78b4d5da34b2593a338780d73be76','','','Claim: Individuals are legitimately identifying as and calling for acceptance of a new identity known as clovergender.\n\nClovergender, def: an adult man OR woman who sexually identifies as a child, who is attracted to other children. Also known as kindergender.\n\nok this clovergender kindergender has come up and I REALLY hope it is fake cus otherwise EW.\n\nOrigin:In early 2017 discussionof a new identity known asclovergender began appearingon social media, perhaps most prominently in a series of tweets published by pharmabro Martin Shkreli:\n\nOn 1 January 2017 the term appeared as in a Reddit thread, alongsidea screenshot defining clovergender as adults attracted to children: Separate Reddit threads debated the existence of clovergendered people, based onevidence clovergendered individuals were present on social media. At first, many peopleappeared to take the claim literally without questioning whether the new genderwas a hoax:\n\nA Facebook pagecreated purportedly argued for the recognition of clovergender as separate from pedophilia:\n\nNormally, legitimate but lesser-known sexualities and gender identities accrue a presence on the Internet (such as in forum threads or social media mentions) before becoming a widespread topic of discussion. We should pointout that the definition of clovergender doesnot describe any form of gender, but a sexual identity generally accepted as deviant. That the concept appeared from the ether on or around 1 January 2017 strongly suggests itwas a hoax.\n\nSeveral users captured 4chan screenshots from 31 December 2016 and 1 January 2017 demonstrating that the clovergender idea was cooked up by resident pranksters in an attempt to mock individuals of non-binary gender (i.e., transgender people, gender fluid people, and people of alternate gender):\n\nThe clovergender hoax was referenced on subsequent 4chan submissions, prompting users to reiterate that the claim was a hoax. (The clover symbol has long been associated with 4chan.)Concurrent threads discussed building upon the non-existent gender identity to further agitate and aggravate the individuals targeted by the prank. The underlying intent of the clovergender hoax appeared to be underminingthe legitimacy of transgender identity, by suggesting its existence enabled anyone to normalizeany behavior or trait (even the most taboo practices) asa gender. The hoax is apparentlypart of a years-long tradition on the part of4chan and 8chan to dupethe media and social media with fantastical claims of non-existent trends and events.\n\nPrior to inventing a clovergender in 2016, the same groups fooled manypeopleinto believingHillary Clinton tweeted a #DraftOurDaughters hashtag. Pranks in 2015 included circulation of misinformation about Black Lives matter demonstrations, a White Student Union hoax trend, and the production of a massively popular anti-refugee video. Earlier efforts included claims that feminists were attempting to forgo menstrual hygiene products,end fathers day(reported by Fox News as a genuine campaign), and that women were dangerously seekingto achieve abikini bridge. Like those previous hoaxes, a great many social media users were immediately skeptical ofattempts to pass off clovergender as asincere gender identity.','2017-03-25 03:51:15'),(761,99,'fb2b7440161d0c213f2d4974fdeb4868660ea84d605ee3e76aafc160c2a888d7','09fce9a7b7724d68a63b060767f9c438','','','Please check this from Tyler Perrys face book page.\n\n Oprah & Tyler Will Be Delivering $4000 Cash & A 2017 White Ford Explorer To A Beautiful Family, This Wonderful New Years Eve 12/31/2016.

A hoax is circulating social media that the over-the-counter painkiller is contaminated with the Machupo virus and should be avoided.\n\nWhere did this hoax originate? In early 2017, social media warnings about paracetamol allegedly contaminated with the Machupo virus began circulating. Machupo (also known as Bolivian hemorrhagic virus or black typhus) is endemic in north and east Bolivia, and is generally spread through air or food.\n\nAccording to these warnings, new very white and shiny P/500 paracetamol has become contaminated with the pathogen, posing a severe risk of infection for those who take the drug. However, these warnings generally appear alone, without any news reports or public health agency releases attached to corroborate the claims.\n\nHere are some examples of people sharing the hoax on social media.\n\nAccording to Snopes, there is no truth to the warning. Public health officials have released statements confirming that the rumors were just that, and not credible. Indonesias Food and Drug Administration counterpart also advised that the claim is a hoax.\n\n[Prior to the spread of social media rumors, the agency] never received credible reports that support the claim that the Machupo virus has been found in Paracetamol drug product or other drug products. Machupo virus itself is known is a type of virus that spread can occur through air, food, or direct contact. Machupo virus can be sourced from the saliva, urine, or feces of infected rodents and become a carrier ( reservoir ) of the virus. Head POM, Penny K. Lukito said that POM never find things like that rumored, including Machupo virus content in the drug product.\n\nOn Feb. 8 2017, public health officials in Malaysia further debunked the rumors by reiterating that viruses typically cannot survive the pill-making process.\n\nThe Malaysian Health Ministry today shot down rumours circulating on social media that P/500 paracetamol tablets in Malaysia contain the Machupo virus. Malaysias Health director-general Datuk Dr Noor Hisham Abdullah said, just like most viruses, the Machupo cannot live in dry environments such as in paracetamol tablets. The Machupo virus is categorised in the Arenavirus group which could cause haemorrhagic fever. At the moment, the virus can only be found in South America. It is spread through the urine or faeces of infected rodents, he said in a statement today. Noor Hisham said the ministry had not received any reports regarding paracetamol contamination from authorities in manufacturing countries or any other country so far.\n\nParacetamol is used to treat many conditions such as headache, muscle aches, arthritis, backache, toothaches, colds, and fevers. It relieves pain in mild arthritis but has no effect on the underlying inflammation and swelling of the joint.\n\nHave you seen people spreading this hoax on social media?

At worst, it can inspire violence.\n\nHONG KONG - Speaking with the next generation of Chinese journalists is an eye-opening experience, and a humbling one.\n\nThey know enough about the United States to marvel at our presidential campaign. They know enough about their own country to understand how daunting it is even to think about bringing to China the sort of journalism that Americans take for granted.\n\nThere is no safe way in mainland China to seriously criticize senior leaders in the central government. You might occasionally be able to report on local corruption, but only if some lucky combination of events lets you publish before local powers silence you.\n\nThat silence can last forever. One journalist exposed a group that was scooping up cooking fat from the gutters (think, \"sewers\") and reselling it. He died of multiple stab wounds.\n\nHong Kong, a special administrative region within China, still enjoys substantial press freedoms. On the mainland, however, the government imprisoned 23 journalists and 84 bloggers last year, on charges such as, \"Incitement to subvert state power,\" or \"disseminating false information.\"\n\nAt a recent seminar here on American journalism, some Chinese students called us role models. We thought the inspiration ran in the other direction. We are protected by America\'s constitutional democracy, which from here looks simply glorious.\n\nJust across the border, meanwhile, the Communist Party\'s media cite Donald Trump\'s campaign as evidence that American democracy is broken.\n\n\"Democracy doesn\'t work\" is a convenient argument for authoritarians to make. So far, the great strength of American democracy has been that when problems arise, we fix them - before the system breaks. Based on the tone and tenor of the presidential campaign, I\'d say we have some fixing to do.\n\nAmerican politics always has wrestled with two related phenomena. Voters have only a limited amount of time for political news, and are inclined to love tales that agree with their preconceptions. Political operatives, hoping to generate outrage and convert it into contributions and votes, are happy to provide that material, genuine or false.\n\nIn the 1800 presidential campaign, Thomas Jefferson, the author of the Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom, was accused of secretly planning to confiscate Bibles.\n\nThis year, Donald Trump launched a barrage of divisive falsehoods. He claimed to have seen thousands of American Muslims celebrating the destruction of the World Trade Center towers. He retweeted a false white-supremacist claim that 81 percent of white murder victims are killed by blacks. He claimed that murder rates are the highest in 45 years.\n\nJournalists generally can deal with falsehoods uttered by the candidates themselves. Fact checkers quickly noted that the Muslim celebration never happened, that 84 percent of whites are killed by other whites, and that murder rates are lower than any time between 1965 and 2009.\n\nWhat\'s harder to combat is the hidden damage done by countless purveyors of fake news, on fake websites and on social media. Digital tools have made fakery faster, easier and more convincing than ever before.\n\nFacts matter, even if politics mostly reflects tribalism or cultural values. The images around which tribe and culture coalesce consist, like Impressionist paintings, of countless bits of perceived fact. Injecting falsehood into those pictures warps cultural perceptions and poisons political dialogue. At best, it becomes harder for us to talk to each other. At worst, it can inspire violence.\n\nFake news was found on both sides of this year\'s campaign, but not in equal proportion. When Buzzfeed analyzed large \"hyperpartisan\" websites, it found that false or misleading items accounted for19 percent of all items on liberal pages, and 38 percent of the posts on conservative pages.\n\nMany of those lies were designed to inspire fear and rage. Among liberals, the exaggerations and untruths often attacked Trump himself. Among conservatives, they often smeared entire ethnic or religious groups.\n\nA conservative Facebook page called Freedom Daily, with more than 1.4 million fans, posted a report in September about an alleged attack by members of Black Lives Matter. It said, \"Two white men doused with gasoline, set on fire by blacks - media CENSORED.\" In fact, the situation had been widely reported, it involved a dispute among co-workers, it had nothing to do with Black Lives Matter, and neither of the men was white.\n\nAlso in September came a social media report that Black Lives Matter demonstrators had attacked and beaten a homeless veteran in Charlotte simply because he was white. One post poignantly said he was a \"Purple Heart decorated Korean War homeless veteran.\"\n\nBut the Charlotte attack never happened and the Charlotte man did not exist. There had been a street assault in London (hence the red double-decker buses in the background of an accompanying video), but it had nothing to do with Black Lives Matter.\n\nJust before Election Day, another post, published by the \"Denver Guardian,\" said that an FBI agent involved in the investigation of Hillary Clinton\'s private email server had killed his wife, and then himself. The tale neatly fit the conspiratorial \"Killary\" narrative. The \"Denver Guardian\" is a fake news site, and the story was totally fabricated.\n\nThese fake stories clearly mattered to some readers, who demanded to know why we censored the (fake) news.\n\nIndeed, fake posts are an international industry. Buzzfeed found that teenagers in the Macedonian town of Veles had launched dozens of websites devoted to misleading Trump supporters, with headlines like, \"Your prayers have been answered\" falsely claiming that Clinton was about to be indicted.\n\nThe teens said they were motivated by clicks and advertising dollars. The online market for fake news that pleased American conservatives was far more lucrative than the market for fake news that pleased American liberals.\n\nOnline, fakery can be a better business than real news. There\'s no need to invest time and money verifying facts, or to include the nuances that complicate genuine news stories. Freedom from fact allows for some incredible headlines.\n\nThose fake headlines appeal to one of humanity\'s most powerful needs, for validation. We are hard-wired to prefer information that confirms our personal beliefs, and to reject or resent information that challenges them. Sensational fake stories are often far more popular than real news items; corrective posts, if any, are but lightly read.\n\nThe popularity of fake news items and their close cousins, misleading and one-sided posts, makes them irresistible to algorithm-run social media sites, such as Facebook, which exist to encourage users to click on their offerings.\n\nFacebook knows what we and our friends like. It targets us with the news likeliest to please us, whether we ask for that filtering or not. Liberals and conservatives get totally different streams of \"news.\" (To see for yourself, go to: http://graphics.wsj.com/blue-feed-red-feed/ ).\n\nHow can democracy thrive, or even function, in a world where we live in artificially induced terror of each other, holding contradictory factual beliefs?\n\nThere\'s much to be done here. Certainly, we journalists need to perform better. But nothing we publish matters much if citizens dismiss it as propaganda. Many do dismiss the plain truth today, because it contradicts the torrent of beautiful lies flowing from ideological websites and social media streams.\n\nDonald Trump attributed his victory partly to social media; Facebook\'s Mark Zuckerberg said it was \"crazy\" to think fake news influenced the election. And yet, Facebook and Google just announced that they are taking technical steps to rein in fake news. That\'s a start, but the material is so easy to create and so tempting to read that it\'s likely to persist.\n\nFor anyone trying to keep politics sane, here are a few suggestions.\n\nIf you\'re reading this newspaper, you are already part of the solution. Thank you.','2017-03-25 03:51:15'),(765,100,'fb74317510048c7bcd071ad32e70625c4f680ce2a7124ce544647d32959541bf','08aaac0add4740968ca799610dfd9ce2','','','Chaos gripped the streets of Charlotte, NC last night, as angry rioters turned violent for the second night in a row over the deadly police shooting of a black man.\n\nReports on the violence that have emerged from Wednesday nights violence are shocking  and included disturbing news that the bloodthirsty mob attempted to burn a news photographer alive, according to local television station WCCB.\n\nVideo of the reported police response to the scene has since emerged on social media.

That story was made up by an author trying to demonstrate Washington\'s honesty. How ironic!\n\nAnother popular legend is that George Washington had wooden teeth. He did live a long, long time ago, so maybe that story is true. What do you think?\n\nIf you guessed that Washington really did have wooden teeth, you guessed wrong! Contrary to legend, he never had wooden teeth. Although he did have false teeth (called \"dentures\"), none were made of wood.\n\nHistorians believe Washington had lost all but one of his teeth by the time he became president. The dentures he wore when he was inaugurated were made from carved hippopotamus ivory and gold by Dr. John Greenwood, who became known as the \"Father of Modern Dentistry.\"\n\nResearchers have performed laser scans on another set of Washington\'s dentures located at the National Museum of Dentistry. Those dentures were made from gold and ivory, as well as real teeth from humans and animals, such as horses and donkeys.\n\nAnother popular legend holds that Washington once threw a silver dollar across the Potomac River. Although Washington was quite athletic, he could not have thrown a silver dollar across the Potomac, which is more than a mile wide. Also, there were no silver dollars when Washington was young.\n\nOne of his distant relatives, however, once reported that Washington threw a piece of rock about the size and shape of a dollar\" across the Rappahannock River, near Fredericksburg, Virginia, where he grew up. We don\'t know for sure if this is true, but historians believe it could be.\n\nAt the site of the Washington family homestead, the Rappahannock River is only 250 feet across, making for an impressive but not impossible throwing distance.\n\nIn light of the half-truths about Washington we\'ve uncovered, let\'s take a look at some things we know to be true.','2017-03-25 03:51:15'),(769,101,'ff076c0f665e4303bfd8c2eb670f2fd6788c3122ee38d4e9461b53c8183c23ce','cc9657fa83d54e97af92f190e42797c4','','','Q: Was Washington born at Mount Vernon?\n\n A: No. He was born February 11, 1732, near Bridges Creek, on an estate later called Wakefield (probably named by Washingtons nephew William Augustine Washington), in Westmoreland County, Virginia, about forty miles south of Mount Vernon.\n\nQ: When did Washington die and what ailment caused his death?\n\n A: Washington died at Mount Vernon in the late evening on December 14, 1799 from a throat infection called epiglottitis. On December 18 he was buried in the family vault at Mount Vernon.\n\n\n\nQ: Were all the pall bearers at President Washingtons funeral Masons?\n\n A: Mrs. Washington designated the Masonic Fraternity to take charge of the funeral. She requested, however, that Colonel Philip Marsteller, who was not a Mason, be a pall bearer.

The first public celebration as a holiday was by order of Comte Rochambeau, February 12, 1781, when the French Army in Rhode Island was granted a holiday on that day, Monday. February 11th, 1781, Washingtons birthday by the Julian Calendar, happened to fall on Sunday.\n\nQ: Why is Washingtons birthday celebrated on February 22 when he was born on February 11th?\n\n A: February 11th was GWs birthday according to the Julian (Old Style) calendar, but in 1752, the corrections of the Gregorian (New Style) Calendar were adopted by England, Ireland, and the colonies, and GWs birthday became 22 February [Donald Jackson and Dorothy Twohig, eds.,The Diaries of George Washington, vol. VI, January 1790December 1799 (Charlottesville, VA: University Press of Virginia, 1979) 282.]\n\nUnder Englands interpretation of the Julian Calendar the new year began on 25 March. Because the year under the Julian Calendar was 365 days 6 hours, by the sixteenth century a considerable surplus had accumulated, moving the vernal equinox from 21 to 11 March. The error was corrected in 1582 by the Gregorian Calendar (New Style), adopted by most European countries. By 1752, when Great Britain adopted the Gregorian Calendar, the displacement was 11 days.[Donald Jackson, ed.,The Diaries of George Washington, vol. I, 1748-65 (Charlottesville, VA: University Press of Virginia, 1976), 6.]\n\nQ: What was George Washingtons middle name?\n\n A: According to therecord of his birthin the family bible, Washington was not given a middle name.\n\nQ: Who were Washingtons parents?\n\n A: George Washington was the son of Augustine Washington and his second wife, Mary Ball Washington. Few people know of Georges father, because Augustine died when George was only eleven and he rarely spoke of him. But many people knew of his mother, Mary Ball Washington. She lived to be 82, and saw her son elected first President of the United States in 1789. (courtesy Mount Vernon)\n\nQ: Did George Washington have any brothers or sisters?\n\n A: Washington had five brothers and one sister who reached maturity: Lawrence, Augustine, Samuel, John Augustine, Charles and Betty. The first two were half-brothers. There were also a half-brother and half-sister and a full sister who died young.\n\n\n\nQ: How tall was George Washington?\n\n A: To the best of our knowledge Washington was about six feet in height. There are records which show his measurement to have been between six feet and six feet two inches at various times. He registered six feet three and one-half inches when measured for his coffin.\n\nQ: Did George Washington wear a wig?\n\n A: No. He wore his own hair which was light brown in color, tied in a queue and powdered. The queue was sometimes worn in a small black silk bag.\n\nQ: Did George Washington have wooden teeth?\n\n A: He had several sets of false teeth over the years, but they were not made of wood. For at least one set, Washingtons dentist, Dr. John Greenwood, used a cows tooth, one of Washingtons teeth, hippopotamus ivory, metal and springs. The teeth fit poorly. (courtesy Mount Vernon)\n\nQ: Where are George Washingtons false teeth?\n\n A: One set is in the Baltimore College of Dental Surgery, one set in possession of Joseph R. Greenwood of New York, and another set at Mount Vernon.\n\nQ: Did George Washington chop down a cherry tree?\n\n A: Probably not. The story was likely invented by a man named Mason Weems shortly after Washingtons death. Ironically, the story was intended to show how honest Washington was: George confesses to his father saying, I cannot tell a lie.\n\n\n\nQ: Did George Washington own slaves?\n\n A: Yes. At age eleven he inherited ten slaves from his father. By the end of Washingtons life, over three-hundred African-American slaves lived at Mount Vernon. (courtesy Mount Vernon).\n\nQ: Did Washington free his slaves?\n\n A: Yes. Washingtons attitude towards slavery changed as he grew older and especially as he fought for liberty in the Revolution. He emancipated his slaves in his will and his estate paid pensions to the older African Americans for decades.\n\nQ: Which portrait of George Washington appears on the Dollar Bill?\n\n A: The picture on the Dollar Bill was taken from the Athenaeum Portrait of George Washington by Gilbert Stuart. The original was painted in 1796.\n\nQ: How many times did George Washington actually sit to different painters for his portraits?\n\n A: There are nineteen artists of which there is little doubt that Washington sat for portraits. For some of these he sat more than once. Washington also sat for sculptors Houdon and Ceracchi.\n\nQ: Was Robert E. Lee related to George Washington?\n\n A: Robert E. Lee married the granddaughter of Jackie Custis who was Washingtons stepson. Lee is also GWs third cousin, twice removed, since both men are descended from Augustine Warner, Sr., and Mary Towneley Warner (GW by way of their son, Augustine, Jr., and Lee by way of their daughter, Sarah). (courtesy Frank Grizzard)\n\nQ: Which states or future states did Washington visit in his lifetime?\n\n A: Connecticut, Delaware, Georgia, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Virginia, and West Virginia. It is not unlikely that he was within the bounds of Vermont during his trip to Lake Champlain in 1783.\n\nQ: Did Washington ever leave the United States?\n\n A: The only trip George Washington made outside of his own country was when he accompanied his half-brother Lawrence to the Barbados (17511752).\n\nQ: Was Washington ever awarded a college degree?\n\n A: Washington was not a college graduate but he received an honorary LL.D. from five educational institutions: Harvard, 1776; Yale, 1781; University of Pennsylvania, 1783; Washington College (Maryland), 1789; Brown, 1790. Although he did not complete college, Washington did maintain a large library at Mount Vernon.\n\nQ: Did Washington ever practice law or did he ever appear in court as an attorney?\n\n A: No. Washington acquired much legal training incidentally in connection with his duties as guardian and the many trusteeships and executorships which he assumed. He was, moreover, for years a justice of the peace of Fairfax County and not only heard minor cases, but also was a member of the County Court, which had an extended jurisdiction in equity as well as in civil and criminal law. In colonial days the justices were the county gentlemen, not trained lawyers, but the service was an excellent training in legal knowledge.\n\nQ: How many letters did George Washington write during his lifetime?\n\n A: Only a rough estimate can be given. The best authorities have estimated the total to be between 18,000 and 20,000. Of these, considerably fewer than half are in Washingtons own hand writing.\n\nQ: What was the last letter that George Washington wrote?\n\n A: The last letter that George Washington wrote was to his farm manager on December 13, 1799, the day before he died. He wrote Alexander Hamilton on the proposed Military Academy, on December 12.\n\nQ: To whom did Washington leave his public and private letters and papers?\n\n A: To his nephew, Bushrod Washington.\n\nQ: When did the first direct ancestor of George Washington land in America?\n\n A: John Washington, according to the best accounts available, landed in America early in the year 1657. His father had been a follower of Charles I during the civil war in England and had lost his benefice by order of Parliament, and evidently the young man was on his own very early. He was probably about 25 years old when he immigrated. George Washington was a direct descendant of John Washington, the immigrant.\n\nQ: Did Washington actually write theRules of Civility?\n\n A: No. In fact The Rules of Civility and Decent Behaviour in Company and Conversation have been traced back to the sixteenth century. Some of the maxims were so fully exemplified in Washingtons life that biographers came to regard them as formative influences on his character.\n\nQuestions and Answers taken from: History of the George Washington Bicentennial Celebration, Volume II, Literature Series (Washington, D.C.: George Washington Bicentennial Commission, 1932), 643-688.

Dental issues plagued Washington for most of his adult life. He began losing teeth as early as his twenties, and was eventually forced to wear several sets of unsightly and painful dentures. Rather than wood, Washingtons many false choppers were made out of varying combinations of rare hippopotamus ivory, human teeth and metal fasteners. He got his fist set before the Revolutionary War, and may have also undergone a tooth transplantation procedureperhaps even using teeth purchased from his own slavesin the mid-1780s with the help of his personal dentist and friend, Jean-Pierre Le Mayeur. Nevertheless, by the time he was inaugurated as president in 1789, Washington only had a single natural tooth left. He took the oath of office while wearing a special set of dentures made from ivory, brass and gold built for him by dentist John Greenwood. After Washington lost his sole surviving tooth, he gifted it to Greenwood as a keepsake.\n\nThough Washingtons dentures were fashioned by some of the best dentists the late 18th century had to offer, they still left him disfigured and often in pain. Keeping his false teeth looking pearly white was a constant chore, and Washington often shipped them off to Greenwood to keep them in working order. The teeth would easily turn brown without regular care and cleaning, and their occasionally unsightly appearance may have first jumpstarted the rumor that they were made from wood. Worse still, the dentures caused jaw discomfort and forced the Presidents lips to, as he once wrote, bulge in an unnatural fashion. This facial disfigurement is particularly apparent in artist Gilbert Stuarts famous unfinished painting of Washington from 1796the same portrait that appears on the one-dollar bill.\n\nAccess hundreds of hours of historical video, commercial free, with HISTORY Vault.

During the Revolutionary War, he led the Continental Army. George Washington was one of the founding fathers of the United States of America, and soon after the American Revolution, he became the nations first leader and president. George Washington was a man of great prestige and honor, but how much of what we know about him is actually true?\n\nOn Feb. 22, 1732, George Washington was born in Virginia to Mary Ball Washington. George was one of ten children born into the aristocratic Washington family, who were known for growing tobacco and preparing timber. Washington attended school at a nearby church, then later went to a boarding school to further his education. His formal education came to an end at the age of 17, when Washington began working as a surveyor licensed by the College of William and Mary. In 1752, Georges elder brother passed away, endowing him with the care of the Mount Vernon estate that his brother owned. This new property came with its fair share of responsibilities, including overseeing the militia in that district. The governor of Virginia noticed Washingtons exceptional work as a surveyor and later appointed him to a position with the Virginia militia. Earning this position launched Washingtons military career into overdrive. He fought bravely during the French and Indian War, when he picked up military tactics he would use later during his time leading the Revolutionary War.\n\nThough Washington is best known for his military service and presidency, there are several other stories that people think of when they recall his life. One of the most popular stories tells of Washington as a young child. The story is that Washington received a hatchet as a gift when he was just six years old. Using the hatchet, Washington caused some damage to one of his fathers favorite cherry trees. When his father discovered what had happened to his tree, he became angry and asked George what had happened. George, being an open and honest person, told his father that he cannot tell a lie and that he had cut the tree down. This story is quite famous and led many people to believe that Washington was a very honest person. The cherry tree story is still told today and showcases Washingtons reputation for virtue.\n\nSecond only to the cherry tree tale is the myth about Washington having wooden teeth. Many folk tales say that Washington had wooden teeth. While it is true that he had bad teeth, his false teeth were not made of wood. Back in those days, false teeth were made with ivory. Over time, the ivory would become stained, which gave it a grainy appearance similar to wood. The teeth were never actually made of wood, though.\n\nWashington is one of the most notable individuals in Americas history. His story is both unique and interesting and still taught today in the United States. Its no surprise, then, that he has become a mythical figure in the history of the country. But even the facts are impressive; we hardly need tall tales to have an appreciation for Washingtons life and accomplishments.','2017-03-25 03:51:15'),(772,101,'ff076c0f665e4303bfd8c2eb670f2fd6788c3122ee38d4e9461b53c8183c23ce','9945b8d97ba24dd589b4df8880a0dd53','','','When George Washington became president on April 30, 1789, he only had one tooth in his head, a single premolarpoking up from his gums. A combination of bad genes and even worse 18th century dentistry meant that the man who first led the nation suffered from terrible teeth. But a toothless grin isn\'t very Presidential, and so Washington wore dentures. Somewhere along the line, the famous myth that Washington wore wooden dentures took root.\n\nBut that myth,John Smith, Jr., writesin a story for the Journal of the American Revolution, is just that.George Washington never had wooden teeth, nor did anybody of his time. It would have been kind of dumb to make teeth out of wood when better materials were available. says Smith:\n\nWashingtons dentures over the course of his lifetime used materials like human teeth along with bone and ivory from hippopotamus, or sea horse as it was called in its day. Ivory from walrus and elephant may also have been used, along with lead, gold metal wire and springs, and brass screws.\n\nSo where did the wooden tooth myth come from? According to Smith:\n\nIts hard to say...but historians and forensic dentists possibly knowhowit got started. Ivory and bone both have hairline fractures in them, which normally cant be seen. With Washingtons fondness for Madeira wine, a very dark wine, over time the darkness of the wine started to darken the false teeth of the dentures. Then the thin fractures in the bone started to darken even more than the rest of the tooth, making the lines look like the grain in a piece of wood that misled later observers.\n\nGeorge Washington\'s historically terrible chompers meant that he spent a fair bit of time fussing over teethand not only his own. According to Mount Vernon, the historical site of Washington\'s Virginia home, Washington had at one point bought 9 teeth from African-Americans:\n\nIts not clear if Washington intend to use these teeth as implants or within a new set of dentures or if he employed the teeth at all. While this transaction might seem morbid to a modern audience, purchasing human teeth was a fairly common practice in the 18th century for affluent individuals.','2017-03-25 03:51:15'),(773,101,'ff076c0f665e4303bfd8c2eb670f2fd6788c3122ee38d4e9461b53c8183c23ce','1df4ec1a4c66479eaaf1f0d4eb9b7eea','','','One of the most popular historical exhibits at Mount Vernon, originally the estate of the first President of the United States and nowa monumentto his life and legacy, is a set of the great mansdentures. The crude, handmade prosthesis, comprising both upper and lower teeth, is displayedin acircular glass case permitting a360-degree view. The majority of Mount Vernons one million visitors per year, one presumes, pauseto stare at the famous choppers for at least a moment before moving on to the table settings.\n\nThe fascination with George Washingtonsfalse teeth couldbe attributabletovarious factors that theyrea medical curiosity from the 18th century, when dentistrywas still just this side of barbaric; that theyrean intimate vestige of the man himself, lettingus feelcloser to him; or, maybe, that were alljust eager tosee if the scuttlebuttwe heard and repeatedas kids is true: that the Father of Our Country had wooden teeth.\n\nThe exhibit does not disappoint. One look at the contraption itself, which is actually made out of metal, ivory, and realteeth (both animal and human), is enough to see that itwasnt carved out of wood:\n\nPlus,theres aplaque, which lays out the factsin black and white:\n\nAs was common at the time, the dentures were ill-fitting, awkward, and sometimes painful. They distorted Washingtons appearance, mainly by makinghis lower lip protrude, as can be seen in contemporaneousportraitureof the first president. According to historian Michael Beschloss, his teeth were an embarrassment to him:\n\nHe once pleaded with his dentist, John Greenwood, by letter, to avoid any change to the denture which will, in the least degree force the lips out more than now do, as it does this too much already. Members of his cabinet sadly noted how rarely the tight-lipped president smiled or laughed. Others insisted that his embarrassment about his dentures, which sometimes caused him to hiss as he spoke, made him reclusive.\n\nWashington was plagued bydental problemsthroughout most ofhis adult life. Heattributed the misfortune to cracking of walnuts in his youth, his friend John Adams wrote, though hereditymust have played a part, as well. Bad hygiene, too, though Washington wouldnt have beenentirely to blame. Its not that George Washington was sloppy about dental hygiene, John L. Smith notesin Journal of the American Revolution,its just that dental hygiene was practically non-existent in the late eighteenth century:\n\nIn fact, in some social groups, taking care of your teeth was even considered effeminate or vain. But Washington was very wise about the message an image can send, and knew that in the Continental Congress, and as commander-in-chief and president, he had to look the part of a leader  which meant at least having teeth. Aside from the possible constant pain Washington endured from his bad teeth, he stayed on a constant life quest to (simply said)  have teeth in his mouth. And he paid a lot for professional dental care all through his lifetime.\n\nGeorge Washington wore severaldifferentsets of dentures over the course of his lifetime, none made of wood. Instead, the dentists treating him would have used the cutting-edge materials of the time: bone, ivory, lead, brass, gold, and the castaway teeth of horses, donkeys, cows, and, yes, human beings. Washington is said to have saved his own extracted teeth for future use in dentures. A longstanding rumor that Washington purchased teeth from his slaves may be true, as well, Michael Beschloss writes:\n\nAs to how and why the rumor ofWashingtons wooden teeth took hold in the first place, no one knows for sure, but there are two main theories, both based on the assumption that his dentures must havelooked like they were made of wood. One holds that they turned mottled and brown with age, the other that their woodiness was due toWashingtons habit of drinkingfortifiedwine:\n\nIvory and bone both have hairline fractures in them, which normally cant be seen. With Washingtons fondness for Madeira wine, a very dark wine, over time the darkness of the wine started to darken the false teeth of the dentures. Then the thin fractures in the bone started to darken even more than the rest of the tooth, making the lines look like the grain in a piece of wood that misled later observers.\n\nTwo hundred fifty years later, were still talking about Washingtons wooden teeth. Like the cherry tree he never chopped down as a child, they remain forever enshrined in American legend.','2017-03-25 03:51:15'),(774,101,'ff076c0f665e4303bfd8c2eb670f2fd6788c3122ee38d4e9461b53c8183c23ce','56346f7110fc48c0a77a9c8c50e82767','','','Mount Vernon explores numerous myths about George Washington and his famous teeth.','2017-03-25 03:51:15'),(775,101,'ff076c0f665e4303bfd8c2eb670f2fd6788c3122ee38d4e9461b53c8183c23ce','cd4f820bd23d4ecfae38f3fcd7f2aabf','','','George Washington (February 22, 1732[1][2][3]  December 14, 1799) was the first President of the United States (17891797), the commander in chief of the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War,[4] and one of the Founding Fathers of the United States.\n\nHis mother was Mary Ball and his father was Augustine Washington. They owned a plantation with slaves in Virginia. George studied at local schools in Fredericksburg, and was also homeschooled for part of his life. George\'s father died when he was 11. George\'s mother was not fit to look after him.\n\nThere is a well known story about honesty, that Washington cut down his father\'s cherry tree and then admitted it. Although it is a very good example of what Washington was like, the story is not true, although it is an extremely accurate example of an action he would do.\n\nWashington became a farmer like his father. His large plantation was called Mount Vernon. He also worked as a surveyor, someone who measures land. Washington always wanted to be a soldier. He was active in the French and Indian War. His first military actions were a defeat at the hands of the French and their soldiers in Virginia. They fought the Indians. In 1759, Washington married a widow named Martha Custis. They did not have any kids.\n\nWashington was a delegate to the First Continental Congress, which was created by the Thirteen Colonies to respond to various laws passed by the British government. The Second Continental Congress chose him to be the commanding general of the Continental Army. Washington led the army from 1775 until the end of the war in 1783. After losing the big Battle of Long Island, and being chased across New Jersey Washington led his troops back across the Delaware River on Christmas Day, 1776, in a surprise attack on Hessian mercenaries at the small Battle of Princeton and Trenton, New Jersey. The British had more troops and more supplies than Washington. However, Washington kept his troops together and won these small battles.\n\nOverall, Washington did not win many battles, but he never let the British destroy his army. With the help of the French army and the navy, Washington made a British army surrender at Yorktown, Virginia in 1781, in the final major battle of the war. The war officially ended with the Treaty of Paris in 1783. The army in Newburgh, New York had not been paid and some leaders wanted to force the Continental Congress to pay them. Washington made a speech to persuade them not to do that.\n\nWhen the Revolutionary war ended, Washington was a national hero. He was offered what would basically be a dictatorship over the colonies. In a move that surprised everyone, however, Washington said no, quit the army and went home to Mount Vernon. He wanted the colonies to have a strong government, but was tired of leading. He also did not want the U.S. to be run by a tyrant.\n\nA few years later, Washington was called over to host the discussions for the new government. He was voted president of the Constitutional Convention in 1785. Washington wanted the states to ratify the Constitution of the United States and they did, largely thanks to the Federalist Papers, which were written by Alexander Hamilton, John Jay, and James Madison.\n\nIn 1789, Washington was elected president without any competition. Washington was the first President of the United States. Washington helped the government get started. While Washington did not belong to any political party and stayed neutral, he agreed with Federalist policies such as the country having a standing army and a national bank. He was re-elected to a second term. After his second term, Washington decided not to run for reelection even though he was popular enough to probably win in a landslide. His decision set a precedent that every president followed until Franklin D. Roosevelt broke it in 1940.\n\nIn Washington\'s farewell address, he warned the country not to divide into political parties and to not get involved in wars outside of the United States. Washington\'s non-intervention foreign policy was supported by most Americans for over one hundred years. His advice concerning political parties was completely ignored, as parties were already forming at the time of his speech.\n\nWashington went back home to Mount Vernon after his second term ended in 1797. He was very happy to be home. He died on December 14, 1799, in Mount Vernon at the age of 67 from pneumonia. Washington, D.C. and the state of Washington are named after him. Many schools are named after him. His face is on the United States dollar bill and the quarter coin.\n\nFrom his marriage in his 20s, George Washington owned a lot of farm land. He grew tobacco and wheat and vegetables. Washington also owned more than 100 slaves. He made them free when he died. However, he did not have much money in cash. He had to borrow money while he was president. At his death, Washington\'s estate was worth over $500,000.[5]\n\nMany people think George Washington had wooden teeth, but this is not true.[6] He tried many different ways to replace his teeth, though: for instance, he tried having teeth carved from elk\'s teeth or ivory.[7][8] Ivory and bone both have hairline fractures in them, which normally cant be seen which started to darken due to Washington\'s love of wine. The darkened, thin fractures in the bone made the lines look like the grain in a piece of wood.[9] George Washington\'s teeth started falling out when he was about 22, and he had only one tooth left by the time he became president.[7][8] It was hard to talk and hard to eat. At one time, he had fake teeth with a special hole so that the one tooth he still had could poke through;[7][8] he tried to keep them smelling clean by soaking them in wine, but instead they just became mushy and black.[7][8] In 1796, a dentist had to pull out George Washington\'s last tooth, and he kept his tooth in a gold locket attached to his watch chain.[7] When the time came for the president to have his portrait painted, cotton was pushed under his lips to make him look as if he had teeth.[7][8] But the cotton made his mouth puff out too far, as is seen on the picture on the dollar bill.[8]','2017-03-25 03:51:15'),(776,101,'ff076c0f665e4303bfd8c2eb670f2fd6788c3122ee38d4e9461b53c8183c23ce','4b32b291432744a7b514940e2838ba1a','','','George Washington experienced problems with his teeth throughout his adult life.

The incidents were reported in the United States and subsequently in other countries from August 2016.[1][2][3][4][5] The sightings were first reported in South Carolina when a 9-year-old boy told his mother that two males dressed as clowns tried to lure him into the woods.[6] By mid-October 2016, they had been reported in nearly all U.S. states, 9 out of 13 provinces and territories of Canada, and 18 other countries.\n\nPrior to the spate of incidents in 2016, numerous sightings of people dressed as clowns in odd or incongruous settings have occurred throughout the world since 2013. The proliferation of videos and images of these precursor sightings spread through social media posts and viral sharing of the content, most notably from DM Pranks, a YouTube user from Perugia, Italy.[7]\n\nWhile some of the 2016 incidents appeared to be wholly unsubstantiated or lacked evidence of criminal activity, a few led to arrests. Some people were cited or arrested for making violent threats to schools, and some incidents involved robberies and assaults on children and adults.[8][9][10]\n\nBy mid-October 2016, in the wake of hundreds of \"clown sightings\" in the United States and Canada, the phenomenon had spread from North America to Europe, Australia, New Zealand, Singapore and Latin America.\n\nOne possible precursor event was the 2013 sightings of a \"creepy clown\" in Northampton, England. The Northampton clown sightings, which terrorized the town during September and October 2013, were the work of three local filmmakers Alex Powell, Elliot Simpson, and Luke Ubanski.[11] The clown shared similar looks to Pennywise the Dancing Clown from Stephen King\'s book It. The trio started a Facebook page for the so-called \"Northampton clown\" and were using the appearances to drive traffic to the page.[11]\n\nIn March 2014, Matteo Moroni from Perugia, Italy, owner of the YouTube channel DM Pranks, began dressing up as an evil clown and terrifying unsuspecting passersby, with his videos racking up hundreds of millions of views.[7] A rash of sightings appeared in California in October 2014, which centered around the \"Wasco clown\", and primarily occurred in the Bakersfield, California area with photos appearing on social media.[12]\n\nA person in clown attire was spotted in a cemetery in Chicago, Illinois in July 2015. This occurrence involved two residents who spotted the \"creepy clown\" scaling the gate at the Rosehill Cemetery late at night.

Police investigation of the sighting did not lead to any arrests.[13]\n\nThe 2016 clown phenomenon began in Greenville, South Carolina in early August, followed by incidents in Canada shortly afterward. It continued to spread around the U.S. to the present.[14]\n\nIn early October 2016, further incidents were reported in Canada and the first occurrences in the United Kingdom and Australia. British communities have been \"horrified\" and pressure has been placed on police resources.[15]\n\nThroughout this time, Internet social media sites received numerous postings related to the phenomenon.

Most of these threats were disseminated through social media. Police departments in various locations have insisted that while no credible threats exist, parents and children should use caution when out on Halloween Eve and Halloween. Police departments in regions affected by the \"purge\" threats have cautioned residents not to make fear-based attacks on anyone simply because they are dressed in clown attire, but go on to say that any clowns exhibiting bizarre or threatening behavior should be reported immediately to the proper authorities.

The general tone of the bulletin was cautionary, yet at the same time it reinforced the notion that many of the threats specific to clowns attacking schools had \"not been validated\". The bulletin also recalls the 1980s clown sightings in various US cities, as well as providing a phone number, email address and information about a smartphone app that citizens can use to report suspicious behavior to authorities.[245] That same day the \"Bucks County Courier Times\" interviewed Joyce Meder, also known as \"Bubbles the Clown\" regarding the \"creepy clown\" phenomenon. Meder is an Abington, PA-based professional clown who provides entertainment for children.

What started off as reports of creepy clowns luring around neighbourhoods in the US, has suddenly escalated to another level. It is believed that the surge of clowns spotted wielding weapons originated from some states in America, but has made its way up north.\n\nThere was no truth to this story. The Global Sun is a fake news web site that does not publish factual stories, as noted in their disclaimer:\n\nThis fabricated killer clown story was published in amidst numerous reports of clown sightings in the United States. In August 2016, residents of Greenville, South Carolina reported that clowns were attempting to lure children into the woods. A few weeks later, the clowns had migrated to North Carolina, and since then scary clowns have been reported in various locations across the United States  although actual evidence of their existence is lacking:\n\nBut amid all of these reports, no clowns have been photographed. Police investigatorshave found no traces of clown activity.Not even a strayred nose or a strand of bluehair. So what are these insidious creatures? According to one clown expert, theyre probably phantom clowns.\n\nFake news web sites have taken advantage of the recent uptick in coulrophobia to publish bogus reports about clown-related deaths. However, clowns did not kill 23 people in Canada, nor was a clown shot in Fort Wayne, Indiana.','2017-03-25 03:51:15');
